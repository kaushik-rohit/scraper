But what really lies at the heart of these behaviours? Examining the truth behind nature’s special bonds. The Australian journalist Peter Greste, jailed for more than a year in Egypt, has been freed. He was imprisoned after being convicted of spreading false news and colluding with a terrorist organisation, charges he denied. Two of his colleagues remain in a Cairo jail this evening. Also on the programme: After the murder of the japanese hostage Kenji Goto by Islamic State extremists, his mother speaks of her devastation. TRANSLATION: I cannot find the words. I can only express my grief with tears. A pensioner mugged outside his home meets the woman who began a huge fundraising effort for him. More misery for Andy Murray. He’s beaten for the fourth time in the final of the Australian Open. Good evening. After 400 days imprisoned in Cairo, the Australian journalist Peter Greste has been freed, and is on his way home from Egypt. The former BBC correspondent was arrested with two colleagues from the al-jazeera television network in December 2013, accused of spreading false news and colluding with a banned organisation. All three denied the charges. The two otherjournalists, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, remain behind bars. Breaking news, one of our journalists has been freed from prison after 1+00 days behind bars. This was how the news was announced on al-jazeera. Peter Greste was freed and on his way home. The channel says it will fight on for his colleagues. They remain prisoners in Egypt. This is where of three have been held, at this prison. Peterwas three have been held, at this prison. Peter was removed from here in secret and within hours he boarded a plane. Four one and his family the ordeal is finally over. They never expected it to take so long. He spent more than a year behind bars at this maximum security prison complex. He and his colleagues insist the only thing they are guilty of is doing their job. Peterand his family they are guilty of is doing their job. Peter and his family never give UP job. Peter and his family never give up hope, even when a retrial was ordered last month. We know that he will read the positivity and he will not be downcast. He has held out the well so far. We are confident that whatever distance, whatever we still have to run, B will get there to the finishing line. This was Peter on the streets in Egypt, reporting on a protest by supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt accuses al-jazeera of being a mouthpiece for the band Islamists. Many believed be to rent his colleagues were political pawns. -- to rent his colleagues were political pawns. -- Peterand his colleagues. There are hopes one of the others will be deported, perhaps within days. This gives was condemned internationally as a short trial. Egypt will be hoping it can and do some of the damage to its reputation, but campaigners warn that freedom of speech here is still under attack. that freedom of speech here is still underattack. Our under attack. Our correspondent is in Cairo. What was it that made the release possible? Principally, a thaw in relations between Egypt and Qatar. Many believe that these journalists were caught in the crossfire between these two countries. Cairo regards al-jazeera as being hugely supportive of the Ms brotherhood. Recently there has been an improvement-- Muslim Brotherhood. That certainly helped. The president was keen to close the chapter on this. Everywhere he has gone, every interview he has given on any topic, he has been asked about this one. He presents himself as a leader returning Egypt to democracy. It is hard to square that circle when you have award-winning foreign correspondents sitting in jail. The authorities are hoping that by releasing him that they can put a line under this whole story. There are still a case of the other journalist who does not have a foreign passport, and there are concerns that he could be left to languish injail. The mother of a second japanese hostage murdered by Islamic State says she is heartbroken by his loss. Kenji Goto, a journalist, had travelled to Syria in October last year. Today the japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called his killing despicable, and said his government would continue to work with allies to hold IS accountable for its crimes. Our Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports. This report contains large photography. Kenji Goto knew he was going into danger. In this last video of him before his capture by Islamic State, he says so explicitly. Even so, he cannot have imagined that this is how it would end. His distraught mother crying for her son, butchered in a ditch in the desert. TRANSLATION: I am full of resentment. No words can express the loss. just tears in my eyes. japan is not a country known for showing emotion, but today there was no doubting the Prime Minister’s anger. Visibly shaken, he vowed revenge against Islamic State. TRANSLATION: IM speech is thinking -- against Islamic State. TRANSLATION: IM speech is thinking -- I am speechless thinking how the families must be feeling. japan will never again in Dahmer pro -- must be feeling. japan will never again in Dahmer pro -- give in to terrorism. He was killed because he wasjapanese. japanese people terrorism. He was killed because he was japanese. japanese people are wasjapanese. japanese people are no longer immune from being the target of extremists. We have taken safety for granted in the past, says this man, now we must accept we are targets as well, alongside Europeans and Americans. Question is howjapan will respond to this. It has a powerful and modern military but since World War II it has not fired a single shot in anger. Some here would like to genes that. -- a single shot in anger. Some here would like to genes that. -- change that. The government can make the argument that this is more reason why we have to lift the constitutional banjapanese military to do more. I am not sure whether thatis to do more. I am not sure whether that is going to convince everybody. The Prime Minister has long made it clear he wants to scrap this country’s pacifist constitution. cou ntry’s pacifist constitution. Until country’s pacifist constitution. Until now many people here have been deeply suspicious of that idea, but the murder of these two japanese men in one week at the hands of Islamic State could change that. It could help the Prime Minister persuaded a majority of people here that it is same for this country to stand up for itself. -- time. Here, the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, has indicated that a future Conservative government would continue to ring-fence the schools budget in England, at least until 2020. She said it would also set ambitious maths and English targets for 11-year-olds. Here’s our political correspondent, Robin Brant. As the general election approaches, who will spend what and who will cut what is a big issue. So, step forward the Education Secretary, with a huge hint at what the Tories will do. What I can say is that I am absolutely fighting for the schools budget to be protected. The Prime Minister is expected to give more detail tomorrow. But it’s now clear the Conservatives are on the brink of a promise to protect school spending up until 2020. I think everybody watching will conclude that you have won the battle to ring-fence education for schools in England from five to 16. You are nodding about that. But we know more cuts are on the way, whoever wins in May. So, if schools are protected, as well as the NHS and foreign aid, which the Tories have promised, will it be further cuts to defence to make the savings? As well as the promise on no more budget cuts for England, there’s also a new push on standards. The Tories want all pupils doing their 12 times 12, parrot fashion, and reading a novel by the time they come to secondary schools like this. Four. Eight. Schools will have to make sure all 11-year-olds pass the test on times tables and short story writing, or the headteachers could be replaced by high-flyers, or the school turned into an academy with more freedom. The aim is ambitious. By 2020, they want to surpass South Korea, currently fifth in the world. Labour hasn’t yet said how its schools spending will shape up, but it claims standards are under attack. The Labour Party would make sure that we have got qualified teachers in our classrooms. We would make sure that we invest where we need new schools. Make sure we have class sizes under 30. It is notjust about the size of the budget, it is what you do with it. The Lib Dems have gone further, promising to protect more by pledging no cuts affecting three to 19-year-olds. But whatever the promises, critics say rising pupil numbers mean England’s schools are struggling to keep up. A number of British mosques opened their doors today, as part of an initiative to reach out to the public, following last month’s attacks by Islamists in Paris. The Muslim Council of Britain, organising the event, said it was an opportunity for mosques to offer an insight into the way they are run. The disabled pensioner mugged outside his home in Gateshead a week ago has for the first time met the woman who launched a remarkable fundraising effort for him. 21-year-old Katie Cutler set up an online donation page when she heard of the attack on Alan Barnes. The target was £500, but more than £200,000 has now been given. There is some flash photography in this report. Face-to-face for the first time, an emotional occasion for Alan Barnes and Katie Cutler. I knew I would get upset. It is as if it is a dream. I knew I would be overwhelmed. How do you feel? I am not upset. It is magic, really. Idid you feel? I am not upset. It is magic, really. I did not expect anything. Allen, who is visually impaired andjust four anything. Allen, who is visually impaired and just four and just four and a half feet tall, was attacked outside his home and refused to go home. Katie started an online fund to raise money. He was mugged outside of his home in Gateshead week ago. He was knocked to the ground and left with a broken collar bone and within days Katie had set UP bone and within days Katie had set up an appealto bone and within days Katie had set up an appeal to try to help him. She expected to raise £500, but thousands of donations have flooded in from around the world. Rising every hour, the fund is heading towards £250,000. Alan will be able to buy a new house somewhere he feels safe. It is thanks to the kindness of strangers and one young woman who is being called by many men do love the - woman who is being called by many men do love the - macro the Angel of the North. With all the sport, here’s Olly Foster at the BBC Sport Centre. Andy Murray had something of a Melbourne meltdown as he slumped to another defeat in the Australian Open.

He was imprisoned alongside two otherjournalists for more than a year- colleagues say they too now need to be released. We’d like to be pleased and happy for Peter. But we’re still sitting here thinking, how do we make sure Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed follow him out of that prison door? After months of pressure on the Egyptian authorities, we’ll be asking what made the difference. Also tonight: japan vows to continue the fight against Islamic State after the murder of Kenji Goto, held hostage in Syria. A first hand glimpse of one town taken back from IS control- a BBC team reports from inside Kobani. Driving the Islamic State from here came at tremendous cost- hundreds of coalition air strikes which have flattened most of the town. The Education Secretary hints that a future Conservative government will continue to protect schools in England from spending cuts. More tennis history for Novak Djokovic. And more misery for Andy Murray. He’s beaten for the fourth time in the final of the Australian Open. Good evening. After 400 days imprisoned in Cairo, the Australian journalist Peter Greste has been freed and is on his way home from Egypt. He was jailed alongside two other journalists from the Aljazeera network, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. All three denied charges that included spreading false news and said their trial was a sham. Tonight, Aljazeera said it wouldn’t rest until all three men were released. Live now to Cairo and our correspondent, orla Guerin. Well, we believe Peter Greste may be boarding a flight from Dubai to Brisbane about now. His family are expected to give a news conference there in the coming hours. We have already had some reaction from his brother, Andrew. He told us he could not wipe the smile off his face. He said he had already managed to speak to Peter and he was in great spirits. Huddled in a cage, a damaging image from the new Egypt. Many believe that freedom of speech was on trial here. As well as three respected reporters. We begin with breaking news out of Egypt, one of ourjournalists, Peter Greste has been released from prison after 1+00 days behind bars. This is how the news was announced on Aljazeera. Soon after his release, he told colleagues the fight must go on to free Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who remain prisoners. The second sentence, after he said how relieved he was, was that we have to get our two guys out who are still in prison. We would like to be pleased and happy for Peter, but we are still thinking, how do we make sure Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed follow him out of that prison door? This is where all three have been held. held, at the Tora Prison. Peter was removed from here in secret and within hours he had boarded a plane. For Peter Greste and his family, the ordeal is finally over. They never expected it to take so long. He spent more than a year behind bars at this maximum security prison complex. He and his colleagues insist the only thing of which they are guilty of is doing theirjobs. This was Peter on the streets of Egypt, reporting on a protest by supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt accuses Aljazeera of being a mouthpiece for the banned Islamists. Many believe that Peter and his colleagues were political pawns. A global campaign by media organisations kept the jailed reporters in the headlines. President Sisi was kept under pressure. A former adviser told as the President thought locking them UP the President thought locking them up was a costly error. He felt at the time that this was something we should not get into. We are paying a very high price for something that should not happen this way. So President Sisi was concerned about the international fallout? Yes, indeed. Tonight, it is believed that Mohamed Fahmy, a dual national, could soon be deported to Canada. In a tweet from hospital, where he has been receiving treatment, he suggested it would cost him his Egyptian citizenship. The wife of Baher Mohamed, who has no foreign passport, told us she is worried he will be left to languish behind bars. TRANSLATION: Why can’t my children see their father? He is bars. TRANSLATION: Why can’t my children see theirfather? He is in his prime and has been inside the four walls of a prison for a year. What did he do wrong? Is just a journalist. The Aljazeera case has sent a message to alljournalists sin Egypt, and campaigners warn that press freedom is still under attack. The Aljazeera trial has provoked many damaging as gems about democracy here. Campaigners say targeting the press isjust part of a broader crackdown which has seen many opposition figures jailed and more than 1000 killed in the streets. President Sisi will now be hoping the Aljazeera story disappears from the news. The mother of a second japanese hostage murdered by Islamic State in Syria says she is heartbroken by his loss. Kenji Goto, a journalist, had travelled to Syria in October last year. Today the japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called his killing despicable and said his government would continue to work with allies to hold IS accountable. Our Tokyo correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes’ report contains flash photography. It is my responsibility. Kenji Goto knew that he was going into danger. It is pretty dangerous. In this last video of him before his capture by Islamic State, he said so explicitly. Even so, he cannot have imagined that this is how it would end. His distraught mother, crying for her son, butchered in a ditch in a desert. TRANSLATION: I am full of resentment, no words can express the loss, just tears welling up in my eyes. japan is not a country known for showing emotion, but today there was no doubting Prime Minister’s Shinzo Abe’s anger. Visibly shaken, he vowed revenge against Islamic State. TRANSLATION: I am speechless thinking how the families must be feeling. I will not forgive these terrorists, they will pay for the crime. japan will never give in to terrorism. On the streets of Tokyo, as the news spread of Mr Goto’s death, so did the new realisation. He was killed because he wasjapanese. japanese people are no longer immune from being the target of extremists. TRANSLATION: We have ta ken safety for granted in the past. Now we must accept that we are targets too like the Europeans and Americans. The question now is howjapan will respond to the murder. It has a powerful and modern military. Since World War II it has not fired a single shot in anger. Some here, including Shinzo Abe, would like to change that. On the one hand the government would make the argument that this is all the more reason that we need to beef up the war on terror, lift the constitutional ban on the japanese military, to do more. But I’m not sure if that’s going to convince everybody. japan’s Prime Minister has long made it clear that he wants to scrap this country’s pacifist constitution. Until now, many people here have been deeply suspicious of that idea. But the murder of these two japanese men injust one week at the hands of Islamic State may change that. It may help Shinzo Abe to persuade the majority of people here that it is time for this country to stand up for itself. The fate of a jordanian pilot also taken hostage by IS remains unclear. The militants had linked the fate of Moaz al-Kasasbeh to the release of a an Iraqi womanjailed injordan for an attempted suicide attack. Our correspondent Yolande Knell joins us from Amman. How is the jordanian government planning to handle this? The jordanian people are facing more painful uncertainty about this pilot. A short time ago, we had his father speaking to journalists, making an appeal for information. It has been some time since any proof was given he was still alive and there is no information about him in this latest video from Islamic State. The jordanian this latest video from Islamic State. Thejordanian government has said it is renewing its offer to exchange this Iraqi woman prisoner, a failed suicide bomber, for the pilot. The longer the hostage ordeal goes on, the more pressure it puts on King Abdullah ofjordan, who has a lot of domestic political pressure. At the same time, his Foreign Minister came out and said thatjordan and is committed to being part of the US led coalition against Islamic State. One area that has been taken back from IS is the Syrian town of Kobani, where the jihadists were driven out last week after four months of brutal street fighting and air strikes. A BBC team including correspondent Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Tim Facey have become the first western TV crew to return to Kobani - this is their exclusive report. Every street, every inch of Kobani is testament to the apocalypse that the Islamic State brought here. For four months, they faced each other, sometimes just yards apart, and there are still plenty of dangers here. Unexploded mortars, booby-traps. But IS is gone. It’s the Kurds who are left standing, with trophies from the fight. This fighter tells me IS used car bombs packed with explosives, to target our checkpoints. -i-i’IâSâ ITIEFI BFE Wâ8Iây. Their victory came unexpectedly and the outcome is a shock. The Islamic State - here, at least - has been beaten. Most of its people fled Kobani. Those who stayed draped curtains across the roads to avoid IS snipers. I met one of the families who refused to leave. Rahima and her children and grandchildren stayed throughout the worst of the fighting. TRANSLATION: We faced difficulties. We were hungry, we were thirsty, but we are no different from the fighters. They stayed and we stayed. They were in the basement. When they had food, they shared it with us. It was hard, but, thank God, we knew we would win. Those who have not seen the evil that took place here will see it now. Kurdish officials didn’t abandon us. We are going to school now, and we are very happy because we will be able to go back to our villages. They liberated our lands. In the ruins, IS fighters left behind messages. This one, from a sniper, makes a promise to the town of bloodshed, beheadings and destruction. Kobani is now at peace. The streets, or what is left of them, are now silent. But driving the Islamic State from here came a tremendous cost. Hundreds of coalition air strikes, which have flattened most of the town. And Islamic State didn’t go far. They are less than five miles from here. While Kobani has been liberated, the fight against militants goes on. We headed east, closer to the front lines. Here, the Kurdish fighters are young and they are determined. But still, on three sides, they are surrounded by Islamic State. TRANSLATION: The town has been liberated. It’s a big victory. But the bigger win will be to free all of the villages around Kobani. We will never allow a single IS fighter to survive in Kobani. In the war against the Islamic State, the battle for Kobani will be remembered. These streets tell that, with foreign help, IS can be defeated. But only at great sacrifice. The Conservatives have given a strong indication that schools in England will be protected from budget cuts if the party wins the next general election. The Chancellor has already committed extra funds to schools for 2015, but the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has hinted that promise could extend to 2020. She said it would also set ambitious maths and English targets for 11-year-olds. Let’s think about double these numbers. The election campaign is moving into the classroom. The Conservatives say they want all children in England to be able to know their 12 times table, write a short story and be able to read a novel when they leave primary school. Schools where children don’t achieve this could have new headteachers brought in or be made to consider becoming an academy, operating outside of local authority control. But, for the Education Secretary, there is another priority. Money. We are going to have more to say on schools funding very shortly. What I can say is that I am absolutely fighting for the schools budget to be protected. Is that for me? Hinting at a promise to protect spending on schools is not a big surprise. It happens now. So, would Labour do the same? The Labour Party will make sure we have qualified teachers in our classroom. We’ll make sure we’ll invest where we need new schools. We will make sure we have class sizes under 30. So, it’s notjust about the size of the budget. It’s what you do with it. You’ll have noticed that was not a direct answer from Labour. But they are privately hinting they will match the Conservative promise. The Liberal Democrats are talking about a bigger promise, protecting pre-school budgets and those for sixth forms and colleges as well. Education is an absolutely crucial investment, notjust for the economy but for a fairer society. That is why the Liberal Democrats have said we will protect the whole education budget, from cradle to college, from early years right through to the end of school and college. In every election campaign, parties promise to spend money. But that is the easy bit. As those promises stack up, alongside the other promises to deal with the deficit, there is a central question. Where will spending fall or taxes rise? They might not be the questions David Cameron faces in the classroom tomorrow. He is expected to confirm Tory plans to protect the schools budget. But he and the other party leaders know they are questions that will not go away. Labour has hit back at comments by the head of the Boots pharmacy chain that it would be a catastrophe if the party won the general election. Stefano Pessina, an Italian who lives in Monaco, said Labour’s policies were not helpful for business. The Shadow Business Secretary, Chuka Umunna, said a tax exile could not purport to know what was in Britain’s best interests. Time now for some sport. Andy Murray had something of Melbourne Meltdown as he slumped to another defeat in the Australian Open final. The world number one Novak Djokovic beat him in four sets for his fifth title, most of them at Murray’s expense. He’s now been runner-up four times in Melbourne. jon Donnison was at the match. # There’s only one Andy Murray! # The Tartan Army down under. Australia is a long way for a game of tennis, if you go the high road or the low road. Friday night from Glasgow, after work. Arrived at 6:30. We go home at half three in the morning. Back into Scotland on Monday, back to work on Tuesday. It looked like it might be worth the trip. The first sets have the making of an epic contest, both going to tie-breaks. Djokovic took the first, Murray fighting back to win the second. As ever, his fiancee was providing support. After last week’s expedients, she wore a T-shirt with a health warning. -- expedients. Parentaladvisory, expedients. Parental advisory, explicit content. expedients. Parentaladvisory, explicit content. In the third set, his old Demons returned. Moments later, he double-faulted and his game disintegrated. The Serb piled on the pressure. In a flash, 5-0 up in the fourth and match point. World tennis history for Novak Djokovic. It is the Serbs celebrating and the Scots going home disappointed. Andy Murray, now four times a losing finalist here. But there is no shame in losing to a man who has made this tournament his own. The five times champion. It was the 400th old firm match. If you are watching in Scotland, highlights, after this. It is one of football’s biggest and bitterest rivals. After three years apart, Celtic and Rangers reunited. Rarely has anticipation been like this. Those last three years have brought different fortunes. Celtic have flourished, Rangers floundered. They are now in the division below and the gap was soon obvious. Leigh Griffiths, sparking Celtic celebrations. More soon followed, as Kris Commons doubled their lead afterjust 30 minutes. Rarely have this famous fixture looked quite so one-sided. Have Celtic take on more chances, they could have been out of sight by the break. But Rangers launch an unlikely come back? Well, not like this. Wallace’s effort pretty much summed up their afternoon. As the football fizzled out, sparks started flying. A tetchy end to the match, but, for Celtic, soon replaced by delight. The favourites, through to another final. An old firm derby, full of the usual passion, but one were the result was never really in doubt. Celtic are doing the celebrating. With the Cricket World Cup less than two weeks away, England’s final competitive match saw them lose by 112 runs to Australia. That’s all your sport. A disabled pensioner who said he was too scared to return home after being mugged has met and thanked the woman who raised £250,000 for him in an online appeal. Alan Barnes, who was attacked a week ago, told Katie Cutler that the sum was almost too much to comprehend. Charlotte Leeming’s report contains flash photography. Nice to meet you. Face-to-face for the first time. An emotional occasion for Alan Barnes and Katie Cutler. I knew I would get upset. It’s all... It’s as if it’s a dream. I knew I would be overwhelmed. How do you feel, meeting Katie right now? I am not upset, but I’m... It’s magic, really. I didn’t expect anything. Alan, who’s visually impaired and just 4.5 feet tall, was attacked outside his home and refused to go back. When Katie heard what had happened to him, she started an online fund to raise money. Alan Barnes was mugged outside his home here in Gateshead exactly a week ago. The attacker knocked him to the ground, leaving him with a broken collarbone. Within days, Katie Cutler set up an appeal to try and help him. She expected to raise £500, but thousands of donations have flooded in from around the world. Rising every hour, the Alan Barnes Fund is now heading towards £250,000. Alan will now be able to buy a new house, somewhere he feels safe. It’s all thanks to the kindness of strangers, and one young woman who’s now being called by many the Angel of the North. Before we go, a quick look at some of the stories to look out for this week. MPs vote on Tuesday on controversial legislation which would allow the creation of babies using DNA from three people to stop genetic abnormalities. On Wednesday Sirjohn Chilcot gives evidence to a Commons committee on the delays to his report into the Iraq war. And rugby union’s Six Nations championship kicks off on Friday evening. Ireland are defending the title. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from me, stay with us on BBC1- it’s time Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. Private companies are from today being paid to monitor some ex-prisoners - and they’ll get even more money if the former-inmates don’t go back to a life of crime. It’s aimed at promoting rehabilitation - although serious concerns have also been voiced. Daniel Sandford has been to Coldingley Prison in Surrey to find out more. Inmates preparing for life on the outside, learning the skills they need to keep out of trouble. From today, any prisoner who has served a short sentence of less than a year will now be supervised for 12 months after their release. Until now, they have had no supervision on the outside and many reoffend. These changes are something that has to happen. There are so many victims of crime each year because we don’t provide any support and guidance to those who leave prison. What we’re doing is creating, I believe, a system that will be more effective. The changes come at a time of great strain on the prison system, with budgets being squeezed, assaults on staff rising and the probation service undergoing fundamental reform. Controversially, the new system will use private contractors like Sodexo and Interserve to rehabilitate prisoners instead of probation officers, and they’ll be paid by results. There’s a lot of research, experience, and evidence about what makes people desist from crime. Unfortunately, the Government has ignored all of that and is doing a whole project based on the back of an envelope, and perhaps emotion, rather than consideration. They are concerned that the new scheme is more ideological than practical, driven by the justice Secretary’s interest in privatisation rather than any evidence that using contractors will actually work. Nearly 100 years after standing up to developers, a formerjewellers in east London is doing it again. It’s argued the shop, on the Mile End Road, which is now derelict, is part of London’s heritage and should never be demolished. jean MacKenzie has the story. This derelict shop may not seem like much to look at, but look more closely - or less closely, in fact - and you will see that this former jewellers sits slap-bang in the middle of a department store. So, just how did this architectural anomaly happen? Well, in the 1920s, a family of drapers bought this site and their aim was to build the Harrods of the East End. But this one little jewellers repeatedly refused to sell and, eventually, the frustrated family decided to build their department store anyway. The jewellers later closed, and the department store declined. Now, developers want another go. There are plans to turn the building into new shops and offices. But that’s upset some who want to save this original facade. London is fast disappearing, especially the East End, and a new glass box. We are losing the wrinkles, the textures, the things that make the city unique, peculiar and lovable, for those of us who love it. We are losing out to crass developments of the type of buildings which, in 20 or 30 years time, will be pulled down again. The campaigners want Tower Hamlets to list the building. But as this honour is usually reserved for the more grand and ornate, might they struggle? What do you think of this building? I think it looks really ugly. It’s, like, worn out. I think they need to maybe rebuild it, repaint it, repainted. Looks like it’s in transition, like it’s not completed yet. ",,

Prince Charles is injordan where he’s meeting King Abdullah ofjordan this lunchtime as part of a six-day visit to the Middle East. Before leaving, the Prince told the BBC he’s frightened by how easily some young British Muslims are being radicalised by terror groups. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell is travelling with the Prince. I should warn you that his report contains some flash photography. He is respected among the royal families which rule in countries like jordan and in the Gulf, and this visit by Prince Charles to jordan, a few days after the murder by Islamic State of one of the country’s air force pilots, will be appreciated. Charles has a long-standing interest in Islam and the importance of greater understanding between the faiths. His first meeting in Amman was with a group of Christians who were driven from their homes in Syria and northern Iraq by fighters from Islamic State. And it is the process which radicalises young Muslims and sends them to fight for Islamic State which is troubling the Prince. The extent to which this has happened is the alarming part, and particularly in a country like ours where... The values we hold dear, you’d think that people who’ve come here, were born here, go to school here would imbibe those... Imbibe those values and outlooks, but the frightening part is that people can be so radicalised, either through contact with somebody else or through the internet. And I can see, I suppose, to a certain extent, some aspect of this radicalisation is a search for adventure and excitement at a particular age. Charles will meet jordan’s King Abdullah. A few days ago, the king threatened what he called a severe response to the burning to death of the jordanian air force officer by Islamic State. That atrocity, which has so shocked and angered jordan will, without doubt, be one of the principal matters which Charles will discuss with the king. Charles will express Britain’s sympathy and solidarity with jordan in the fight against Islamic State. jordan, of course, want something more tangible. More financial help to cope with the refugees, more extensive training for its military. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, in Amman. The Chancellor, George Osborne, says he’s extending the Government’s pensioner bonds scheme until after the general election. The scheme, which provides better interest rates for savers than most banks and building societies, has proved very popular with the over 65s, with more than a half a million people taking advantage since they were introduced last month. But critics say it amounts to a subsidy to wealthy pensioners at the expense of other tax payers. Here’s our Business Correspondent, joe Lyman. For the over 65 Citizen new and lucrative way to save pennies, with annual interest rates of up to 4%. Even though you cannot move your money when you invest, it is no wonder tensioner bonds other bestselling financial product ever. Today the Chancellor said he would open up the scheme to even more people. Our 65 plus pension of bonds has been the most successful saving products this country has ever seen. Over 600,000 pensioners have benefited from it, and today I can confirm we will guarantee it remains on sale for another three months because this Government backs savers, supports people who do the right thing and is fixing what went wrong in our economy. But working taxpayers may not be in step with the Chancellor on this one. They will be paying hundreds of millions of pounds for the interest on these bonds. It is basically an electoral gimmick. It is bad economics. We still have a huge deficit to get under control and George Osborne has decided to effectively spend several hundred million pounds appealing to pensioners. Labourare in hundred million pounds appealing to pensioners. Labour are in favour of pensioner bonds but critical of how this Government has treated older people. Don’t be surprised if George Osborne tries his best to give away all sorts of things when he is actually trying to erase the memory of how much he has taken away from pensioners, raising the VAT and introducing the granny tax, and he has not said where he will get the money to pay for this. The newly created window for pensioner bonds will be open until mid-May, coincidentallyjust as will be open until mid-May, coincidentally just as the coincidentallyjust as the new government is being elected. The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France have this morning agreed to meet on Wednesday to continue crucial negotiations over the future of eastern Ukraine. The countries have been discussing a proposed peace plan to stop the fighting in the region. The plan is thought to include a buffer zone, requiring the retreat of rebel forces to ceasefire lines agreed last September. Plans to cut the number of avoidable hospital deaths in England have been outlined by the Health Secretary, jeremy Hunt. It’s estimated that up to a thousand patients die unnecessarily each month due to poor care. The announcement comes after significant improvement was shown in most of the 11 failing NHS trusts in England, put into special measures because of their high mortality rates. Our Heath Editor, Hugh Pym, reports. The George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton was one of those identified as having higher than expected death rates. It was criticised for its out-of- hours care and moving patients too often between wards. Under the special measures regime, it was helped by another hospital management team, and regulators kept it under close scrutiny. Last summer it came out of special measures and today’s report says it recorded a strong turnaround in death rates. We have put a number of changes in we knew we were not doing as well before. For example, we have made handover between doctors better and more reliable. We’ve made sure that patients have got regular observations done and that we are acting to rescue patients if they are deteriorating. And other things we’ve put in are things called bundles, which are, really, a checklist to make sure we’re doing the appropriate treatment for very serious conditions like infection or heart failure or pneumonia. Injuly 2013, health regulators in England put 11 hospital trusts into special measures. Five have since come out. The Dr Foster report says that of those 11, death rates fell by 9.4% since july 2013, compared with a 3.3% fall nationally. It is very hard to show a very strong association between someone taking an action here and the death rates falling and the outcomes for patients. In this case, the data are very clear. Things have got a lot better. But within the 11, some have done better than others, with one showing continuing increases in death rates. The Department of Health said the research was further evidence that the special measures regime was working, but Labour said it was because of the Government’s decision to axe thousands of nursing jobs that the hospitals developed problems in the first place. Hugh Pym, BBC News. The cream of British film and TV talent gather this evening for the Baftas. The nominations are led by the film Grand Budapest Hotel, which is up for an award in 11 categories. The best actor category sees Eddie Redmayne’s and Benedict Cumberbatch’s portrayals of scientist Stephen Hawking and computing genius Alan Turing vying for the award.

You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. The next news on BBC One is at 5.35. Until then have a good afternoon. Good afternoon. After the snow and bitter winds of recent weeks, you can put them to the back of your mind as we look at the forecast for the week ahead. Most of you will be dry through this week but with lighter winds through the forecast, the focus will be on who sees the most sunshine, and where the patchy fog will linger through the day. The high pressure will be with us through this week. Here we are seeing some dense fog forming and lingering today, it shows up in the satellite imagery. Carlisle and Manchester in the last ten minutes still hovering around the freezing mark. This breeze brings in more cloud and a few showers to the Highlands and Islands, winds reaching gale force in Shetland later, but away from there, the winds will be quite light. This is where the fog will continue through the day in the Midlands, but most will have a pleasant afternoon for this stage in February. Blue skies overhead, and with lighter winds than we have seen of late it doubly feels quite pleasant out there. A bit more in the way of cloud drifting round the pressure system towards us, so in western areas less in the way of frost. Through southern and eastern areas you will still be scraping the car clear of frost in the morning. A chilly start the Monday morning but not quite as bitter as we have had of late. With winds lighter across eastern parts of England, some mist and fog patches which could take a while to shift. There will be more cloud generally compared with today, but the best of the sunshine will be across eastern Scotland and northern England. That sunshine will be crucial to how warm it feels. Through Monday into Tuesday, the high pushes across, and this is where we will see the fog forming. More of a breeze in Scotland and Northern Ireland, some spots of light rain and drizzle in the north. Temperatures will creep up to the values you can see there. The high pressure looks like to sneaking away but look at how there are very few isobars, the winds will stay light. Once you get the sunshine, you could see maybe 12 degrees. In some of the river valleys we could see the fall lingering and temperatures at1 see the fall lingering and temperatures at 1 degrees if not below. Towards Friday the high pressure sinks southwards. It looks like we could see a weather front porch in across Scotland and Northern Ireland, so there will be a greater chance of seeing something wetter although there is a lot of uncertainty tied in with that.

Good evening. Prince Charles has expressed his condolences to the King ofjordan, and his concern at the horrific murder of one of the country’s pilots by so-called Islamic State. The Prince who’s on a six day visit to the Middle East, has told the BBC he’s both alarmed and frightened by the ease with which young Muslims can be radicalised by terror groups, despite being born and raised in the UK. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell is travelling with the Prince and hasjust sent this report. He doesn’t do politics as such, but there a symbolism to this visit and when Prince Charles metjordan’s king Abdullah, this was Britain saying we stand beside you in the fight against Islamic State. The jordan air force has launched 50 air strikes against Islamic State after the murder of of its air force pilots. Prince Charles told them the situation in Syria could not be more desperate w horrors being inflicted in the name of religion. People have all of faiths have been persecuted and driven from their homes, tortured and killed in the most barbaric way imagined. These are some of the people who have first hand experience of the horrors that are happening in Syria. They’re refugees who have fled from their homes and who are now living at a huge camp across the border in jordan. Charles was shown around the camp, seeing one part of the human tragedy of a neighbouring country. It is the way in which some young Muslims in Britain have been drawn to extremism which is alarming Charles. Before leaving home he spoke of his concerns about radicalisation in a BBC interview. You think that people who have come here and born here, go to school here, would imbibe the sort of... Those values and outlooks. But the frightening part is that people could be so radicalised either through contact with somebody else, or through the internet. Charles’s language was plain, but he framed his comments in such a way is a measure of his concern. Let’s speak with Nick who is injordan. It is unusual for prince to voice his conditions op -- unusual for prince to voice his conditions op -- opinions on such issues? Yes, the assertion by him of the importance of British values, was completely unambiguous. To hear him talk about the importance of British values if you were born in Britain, if you come to Britain, it is reasonable to expect that you abide by British values and outlook. That may well be a view that is widely held in some quarters, but it is not a view that we have heard from Prince Charles in quite such a Pittsy fashion before - from Prince Charles in quite such a Pittsy fashion before - Pittsy fashion before. He is widely respected in Muslim communities, but he feels the need to sound this warning. Does he have the right to speak out in this way? He believes he does and as a future British king, it is his responsibility to Keetchest speak out in a -- king, it is his responsibility to Keetchest speak out in a -- speak out in a nonpolitical passion about matters within his experience and on matters which are of major public concern. Thank you. The Chancellor, George Osborne says he’s extending the government’s ‘pensioner bonds’ scheme, until the General Election. The bonds provide better interest rates for savers than most banks and building societies, and have proved very popular with more than half a million people signing up since their introduction last month. But critics say they amount to a subsidy for wealthy pensioners, at the expense of everyone else. Here’s our Political Correspondent Ross Hawkins. Interest rates are so low its hard to keep savings afloat. So when a Government guarantees a return, it is no surprise there is a rush. No surprise either that he wants to give a little bit more. Backing savers is part of our long-term plan and our 65 plus pensioner bond has been the most successful saving product this country has seen. Over 600,000 pensioners have benefitted and we are going to guarantee that it remains on sale for another three months. Longerfor it remains on sale for another three months. Longer for savers like these in Derbyshire to invest in bonds that could bring in over £1,500 before tax. Even if some think they’re getting more than their fair share. Doing this before the election is a sweetener, because the older people are the only ones that are voting. The youngers ones aren’t. It is nice if pensioners have a standard of living which is comfortable. It is a good thing from the Government’s point of view that they gain more pensioners’ the Government’s point of view that they gain more pensioners’ votes. The government’s borrowing from pensioners and giving them a good return. But there is no such thing as a free lunch. It is costing taxpayers £350 million over five years. Because it costs more to move borrow from voters than the markets. The announcement will make the scheme 50% bigger. That will mean over £100 million of extra Government spending on bonds to help better off older people. Some Conservatives that makes this little sense. Saving is a good thing, but here we are borrowing money to give prefer rential rates to pensioner. It is a form of theft. I would rather we were investing in young people under 1+0. Compared to the huge amounts that flow through the Treasury, the kovss are small. -- costs are small and they say it is about helping savers. But this is a convenient way to critics of getting money to older people that are likely to vote, just before a general election. Labour criticised other decisions that have hit pensioners but don’t oppose the bonds which have been popular with politicians worried about savers and perhaps about their votes as well. The families hoping for the release of two Al-jazeera journalists - still injail despite the release of their colleague Peter Greste last month - have been dealt a blow with a new court date being set for their retrial. Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were imprisoned for allegedly aiding the outlawed political group the Muslim Brotherhood. Orla Guerin is in Cairo for us. Well the only thing certain for these two journalist is they’re due backin these two journalist is they’re due back in court on Thursday. This comes a week after the Australian Peter Greste was released. There had been hopes that Mohamed Fahmy would be deported to Canada after he reling wished his Egyptian citizenship. In a message on Twitter he accused the Egyptian and Canadian governments of playing the blame game and said he remains in legal limbo. We expect lawyers for him and the other to apply for bail when the retrial begins on Thursday. That would give the authorities here at least a temporary solution for both men. They were facing criticism here about the fact that one foreigner had been deported and another Canadian national was about to be and that would have left the sole Egyptian in the case behind bars. Added to this we have Mrs Clooney, the lawyer who represents Mohamed Fahmy. She has written to the president saying she want to come to Cairo to press for his release. That will bring more attention to the case and generate headlines and the authorities will be concerned that this would be a headache that they can do without. Thank you. Negotiations over the fate of Ukraine will resume again on Wednesday after the Ukrainians agreed to meet with leaders from Russia, Germany and France. The proposals still on the table are thought to include a buffer zone that would see rebel forces pulling back to ceasefire lines agreed last September. Plans to cut the number of avoidable hospital deaths in England have been outlined by the Health Secretaryjeremy Hunt. It’s estimated up to 1,000 patients die unnecessarily every month, due to pOoIâ CBFE. Meanwhile there’s been a significant improvement in most of the 11 failing NHS trusts in England put into special measures, because of their high mortality rates. Here’s our Heath Editor Hugh Pym. The Stafford hospital scandal put theish yup at top of the political agenda. Some hospitals were put into a special measures regime. Last sum erp it came out of special measures. And there has been a turn around in death rates. Managers say a key measure was checking procedures. It is a new thing for health care and we know we don’t tick all the boxes and just missing one thing out, an important step can make all the difference. So it is a matter of making sure we are doing everything right. Injuly 2013 regulators put eleven hospital trusts into special measures. Five have since come out. And there was a 9% fall in death rates from july 2013 compared to 3% nationally. The Government believes lessons have been learned from the performance of hospitals in the special measures regime. The Health Secretary will announce a national review of avoidable deaths. The aim being to allow a full assessment of what is happening at individual hospitals across England. The avoidable deaths data will be gathered from a review of 2,000 cases. Labour says the plans are limited and it would go further. They’re not ambitious enough. It is no good just taking the small sample of cases in hospitals. What we want is something more ambitious and we are talking with the professional bodies about how we can have a mandatory review of all hospital deaths. But Government sewerses say the new plans will put the NHS in England ahead of other systems in monitoring avoidable deaths with the aim of trying to cut the rate. Even one life lost to a safety error, they say, is too many. The cream of British film and television talent is gathering for this evening’s Bafta awards.

I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. The officer in charge of Britain’s counter-terrorism has told the BBC that of 600 people who’ve travelled to Syria to fight for IS around half weren’t on the police’s radar. The Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Mark Rowley says the number of high risk individuals involved shows the challenge the force is facing. jean Mackenzie reports. A west Londoner who travelled to Syria to train as a terrorist, Imran Khawaja. He appeared in videos promoting Islamic State. He was arrested when he came back to Britain. He is one of hundreds. The head of the anti-terror police said around 600 people have left to fight for IS and a hundred were not on his radar before they left. This makes the terror threat unpredictable. We are notjust dealing with a classic terrorist organisation organising plots across the world. They’re trying to create a corrupt cult of followers that will act in their name. They’re attracting misfits and the vulnerable and they may act of their own volition. Police think half of the people who travelled to Syria have returned home. Many have been arrested. Downer terrorism arrests have risen by more than a third. There is now one a day. Because of the way IS is recruiting, Met said it can’t fight it alone. What worries us is their ability to reach into communities. We have been making appeals to community to ask for help and we have seen more information coming forward. We need a wider coalition against this threat. A large part of the battle is online, around 1,000 postings are being taken down each week. The threat the commissioner says is unlike any London has faced before. An 18-year-old man is in a serious condition in hospital after being stabbed in Hackney. Officers at the scene on Chatsworth Road late last night were threatened by a large group of people, who threw bottles and other missiles at police.

Prince Charles has expressed his condolences to the King ofjordan, and his concern at the horrific murder of one of the country’s pilots by the extremist group Islamic State. The Prince, who’s on a six day visit to the Middle East, has told the BBC he’s both alarmed and frightened by the ease with which young Muslims can be radicalised by terror groups, despite being born and raised in the UK. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell is travelling with the Prince and has sent this report. He doesn’t do politics as such, at least not overtly, but there is still a very timely symbolism to his visit. And so when Prince Charles met jordan’s King Abdullah, this was Britain saying to jordan we stand alongside you in the fight against Islamic State. And it would seem that that fight is being taken to Islamic State. The jordanian air force has launched more than 50 air strikes in the days since it became clear that one of its captured pilots had been burned to death by IS. This is cockpit video released today by the jordanian military, who say it shows their aircraft attacking Islamic State depots and training centres. Back in Amman, Prince Charlesjoined religious leaders at an interfaith symposium. He told them that the situation in Syria could not be more desperate, with horrors being inflicted in the name of religion. People of all faiths are being persecuted, driven from their homes, tortured and killed, in the most barbaric way imaginable. These are some of the people who have first-hand experience of the horrors that are happening in Syria. They are refugees who have fled from their homes and who are now living in a huge campjust across the border, injordan. Charles was shown around part of the camp, seen for himself one part of the human tragedy of a neighbouring country in which Islamist extremism has taken such a hold. And it is the way in which some young Muslims in Britain have abandoned British values which is alarming Charles. Before leaving home, he spoke of his concerns about radicalisation, in a BBC interview. You would think that people who have come here, were born here, go to school here, would imbibe those values. But the frightening part is that people can be so radicalised either through contact with somebody else or through the Internet. Charles’ language in that interview was unusually pithy and to the point. That he framed his comments in such a way is a measure of his concern. Most particularly, his assertion about the importance of British values was completely unambiguous. Does Charles have the right to speak out like this? He believes very strongly that, as a future British king, he has notjust a right, but a responsibility to do so. The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that he’s extending the hugely popular pensioner bonds scheme, until after the general election. The bonds provide better interest rates for savers than most banks and building societies. More than half a million people have signed up for them, but critics say they’re a subsidy for wealthy pensioners, at the expense of everyone else. Here’s our political correspondent Ross Hawkins. Interest rates are so low it is hard to keep savings afloat. So, when a government digs deep to guarantee a return on investment for older people, it is no surprise there is a bit of a rush. No surprise either that he wants to give a little bit more. Backing savers is part of our long-term plan. And our 65 plus pensioner bond has been the most successful saving product this country has ever seen. Over 600,000 pensioners have benefited from it. What I can confirm today is that we’re going to guarantee that it remains on sale for another three months. A little longer for savers like those here in Bakewell Derbyshire to invest in bonds that could bring in over £1500 before tax in just three years. Even if some think they’re getting more than their fair share. I think doing this just before the election is just a little sweetener. Because the older people are the only ones that vote, and the younger ones aren’t voting. It is nice if pensioners who have worked all their lives have got a standard of living which is comfortable. The government is borrowing from pensioners and giving them a good return. But there is no such thing as a free lunch. It is already costing taxpayers £350 million in extra borrowing costs over five years. The scheme is now expected to become 50% bigger and more expensive, and likely to mean over £100 million in extra spending. Some Conservatives think that makes little sense. I think saving is a good thing but in reality here we are borrowing money in order to give preferential rates to pensioners, it is a form of intergenerational theft. I would rather that we were investing in young people under 1+0, for theirfuture. Compared to the huge amounts of money that flows through the Treasury, the costs are relatively small. Here they insist it is all about helping savers. But to critics, this is a convenient way of getting extra money to older people, who are extremely likely to vote, just before a general election. Labour criticise other decisions that have hit pensioners, but don’t oppose the bonds, which have proved popular with plenty of politicians worried about savers and perhaps about their votes as well. Rossis Ross is here with me now. Labour have had their own announcement to make today about paternity benefits. They have. Labour are targeting this evening another group, parents, vitally important, particularly fathers. They have a plan to increase paternity leave. At the moment it is two weeks but under their plans that would double to four weeks. They say the issue is that you get paid so little, plenty of people think it is not worth taking up. They are going to increase the pay. At the moment you get ÂI38 a week under statutory PaYÂ get ÂI38 a week under statutory pay, but under Labour’s plans, that would rise to £260 a week. The government already has a plan for shared parental leave up and running. Laboursay shared parental leave up and running. Labour say they will pay for this because there will be more free education and childcare for three and four-year-olds. But there will be a lot of scrutiny of their sums. There are already concerns from business groups and after a week of difficult headlines for labour about their relationship with business, anything like this will get a huge amount of coverage. Evidence of how Britain’s biggest bank helped cheat the Treasury out of millions of pounds of tax has been obtained by the BBC. The Panorama programme has seen documents showing how HSBC’s private bank in Switzerland helped some clients stay one step ahead of the law. Client account details dating from 2007 were leaked by a whisleblower. HSBC admits some individuals did hold undeclared accounts, but says it has now ""fundamentally changed"" its procedures. Here’s Richard Bilton. It is the bank that helped clients break the law. Now HSBC’s secrets are out. It starts with a leak. HSBC’s private bank in Switzerland deals with wealthy clients. Now we know how. The stolen accounts were leaked to the French newspaper Le Monde. The international consortium of investigative journalists shared them with panorama and the Guardian. They show widespread tax evasion. Like Stoke city director Keith Humphreys. Notes on a family account say that some of the money is not declared. HSBC did not report him, they helped him, arranging a foreign credit card so that he could bend the money without being taxed. I caught up with him at eight Stoke game. Was it all about tax? Were you a signatory to that account? I don’t know what account you’re talking about. I think you do. Helpfully, a few weeks later, Mr Humphries remembered that money had been paid back to the taxman, but only after the files were leaked. Then there is the bank itself. The European savings directive was meant to tax hidden cash but HSBC showed clients how to get around it. The purpose of the new trust is to shelter the funds from the European savings Directive. I think they were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service, I think that is what they were offering. HSBC would not do an interview, but told us it has fundamentally changed its private bank and now puts compliance and tax transparency ahead of profitability. But has it really changed? Sue Shelley’sjob was profitability. But has it really changed? Sue Shelley’s job was to raise the rules, but she was sacked after a tribunal. They say that the days of helping people bodged tags are gone, is that true? From what I’m seeing, no. The verbal messages were great. But I think in my view they were not put into practice. -- the days of helping people bodged tax. Stephen Green helped run HSBC at the time. The government has seen the damning files but still promoted him to the Lords as a Tory peer and made him a minister. When you were in charge at HSBC, your bankers were helping people dodge tax. Why did you let them do that? I’m not prepared to make any comments on prepared '(0 make any comments on HSBC. prepared to make any comments on HSBC. At the time the taxpayer was missing out because of things you were doing. I’m not prepared to make any comment? No word but plenty of questions about what went on at HSBC. And you can see And you CEI’! SEE ITIOFE OI’! And you can see more on this on Panorama: The Bank of Tax Cheats, that’s tomorrow night at 8.30 here on BBC One. The Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, has accused the Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""acting like a mid-twentieth century tyrant, by fuelling the war in eastern Ukraine. Talks will continue on Wednesday on a new peace plan calling for pro-Russian rebels and government forces to accept a ceasefire and pull back to a dividing line agreed last year. Meanwhile the fighting continues. Our correspondent james Reynolds has been to the town of Vuhlehirsk, which fell to the rebels in the last few days. The rebels of eastern Ukraine took Vuhlehirsk on Wednesday, after a brutal fight. They are now enjoying their victory. High mum -- hello ma’am, we are fighting for ourland, High mum -- hello ma’am, we are fighting for our land, this rebel says to us. Another puts down a stray cat when he sees he is being filmed.

A second civilian rescues some of his belongings. He doesn’t want to talk. The rebels have relied on Russia’s help to take this town. And they want to keep it. They are not interested in any kind of deal which would make them give UP of deal which would make them give up this ground to Kiev. And they haven’t yet finished. Their next target is a government-held town a few miles down the road. TRANSLATION: We need to liberate it. We will go on and liberate everything up to the region of the -- up to the edge of the Dombass region. Then we will see. Taking the insight Dombass region would mean the rebels doubling the land they currently hold. They may not get there, but theirambition currently hold. They may not get there, but their ambition obligates the current conflict. 22 people have died in clashes between football fans and police in Egypt. Security forces have blamed the fans of Zamalek Football Club, but a witness said that police there caused a stampede by firing tear gas into a crowd waiting to get into the stadium. Greece’s Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has been outlining his economic plans for the country. He said he would raise the minimum wage and rehire public servants who were sacked as part of the previous government’s austerity measures. Nigeria’s main opposition party has condemned the decision to postpone the country’s presidential election, calling it a ""major setback for democracy"". The ruling party says the delay is due to the security situation in the north, where government troops are fighting Boko Haram rebels. Will Ross reports from Lagos. It isa It is a fledgling democracy, a nation bursting with potential, but Nigeria may have just taken a dangerous step backwards. just days before people were due to vote, elections have been postponed. The reason given, threats to the country’s security. There are fears they could be cancelled for good. The suspicion is that the military forced the delay to help ensure this man stays in power. President Goodluckjonathan has been having a tough time. He has been lambasted for failing to stop the jihadists in the North East, and be more than 200 schoolgirls abducted last year are still in captivity. Nigerians have been told that the Boko Haram crisis is the reason the election was postponed. The military says it can’t spare any soldiers to help with security during the election. Fraud, indiscipline, corruption... Fraud, indiscipline, corruption. .. Challenge Fraud, indiscipline, corruption... Challenge to the president is coming from a man who has already tasted power. He became head of state after a military coup in the 1980s, but the next year he was overthrown by another military regime. Now he is back and angered by the postponement, but he urged people to remain calm. Delaying the election is a highly contentious move. The Boko Haram crisis will not be ended in the next few weeks, so the excuse of insecurity can be used again to delay or even cancelled the polls. Worrying times for Nigeria. Eddie Redmayne has won the best actor prize at the Bafta Film Awards for his role as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, claiming it was ""the best night of his life"". Coming of age drama Boyhood, shot over 12 years with the same cast, was named best film. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz has the details. There is some flash photography. As the stars rolled up the red carpet for the BAFTAs, the atmosphere was even more upbeat than normal. You get the sense that these are heady days for the British film industry. Our studios are busy, our technicians are admired around the world. The only question remains, can our actors put the icing on the cake by winning a handful of awards tonight? Well, they got off to a good start. And the BAFTA is awarded to... Eddie Redmayne.. This is one of the best nights of my life, so thank you so much. The universe is getting smaller and smaller. He won for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything. Could his co-star make it a double win? Not tonight. Now sometimes I can see the words hanging in front of me and I can’t reach them and I don’t know who I am, and I don’t know what I’m going to lose next. There was no British win in the prestigious West film category either. And the BAFTA goes to Boyhood. This remarkable coming of age film took 12 years to make, as we watch an actor going from boy to man. Patricia Arquette, who plays his mother, won best supporting actress. And although Mr Turner failed to win anything, its director, the doyen of independent film-making, did not go away empty-handed, after being awarded the Bafta Fellowship, Mike Leigh. Some people respect me to be rude this evening, but you are in for a disappointment! What is important to me is that you have ordered me this fellowship, for which I am truly grateful. In the end it was not a great night for British talent, but no matter, there is always the Oscars in a fortnight’s time.

Stay with us on BBC1. It’s time for the news where you are. Good evening. This time last week the weather story was cold with Arctic winds dominating. This week it is a different story. There will be quite a lot of cloud around and a bit of a headache to forecast just where we will see the brakes of sunshine will stop we could see an issue with patchy fog and frost. The reason for this quieter theme of whether is the high pressure sitting across Northern Ireland, and it will stay with us for the week. Generally speaking, quite pleasant. Fortoday we had some decent spells of sunshine across southern and eastern areas, and in fact in the shelter from the Pennines from that sunshine we got some warmth as well, ten and 11 degrees high for the second day running. just that bit further west, across the lake District and into north-west England, freezing fog patches and a grey and cool day, temperatures very subdued indeed. We could see an early frost through the evening in the south-west. Some fog will be re-forming. There will also be a meeting with someone else who has ambitions to lead their country, Hilary Clinton. With Hilary Clinton, one of the things we’re hoping to discuss, is the problem that all great cities face. London obviously with the returnees from the Isil area and how we cope with terror. She has a lot of wisdom and views on that and we will be discussing that but generally it is in the interests of ",,

The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French President, Francois Hollande, are in Moscow this lunchtime for talks to try to end the escalating fighting in east Ukraine. Ukraine’s President, Petro Poroshenko, gave his approval for their proposals, when they met him in Kiev yesterday. There’ve been no details, but the Russians are believed to want to redraw the cease-fire lines agreed last September. The UN says fighting has left more than 5,000 people dead since April. Our world affairs correspondent, Nick Childs, reports. shelling, a shattered neighbourhood in Donetsk in the heart of eastern Ukraine. There is scepticism that the new diplomacy to defuse the flare up in this deadly high-stakes conflict will get anywhere. TRANSLATION: There have been no concrete results yet. They are meeting today. My personal opinion is, it is useless. I don’t expect anything. Iam is, it is useless. I don’t expect anything. I am so tired of this. It has been going on for so long. Around the embattled town of Debaltseve, government forces try to shore up the defences in the face of pressure and advances from the pro-Russian rebels. There is some tentative good news here. A deal on a temporary ""humanitarian corridor"" for civilians. But this is a conflict that’s already left more than 5,000 dead with more than a million forced from their homes. It’s a measure of the concern that this crisis could be about to take a dangerous new turn that the leaders of France and Germany have stepped in, after talks of France and Germany have stepped in, aftertalks in the Ukrainian capital Kiev, they are now preparing for a face to face meeting with Vladimir Putin. It is far from clear a breakthrough is possible. TRANSLATION: We are convinced there will be no military solution to this conflict. We also know the question remains fully open whether we will succeed in achieving a cease-fire through these talks. Another key player, and another potential development that could raise the stakes in this crisis further. The US Secretary of State is now in Germany for a security conference. The West blames Russia for fuelling the fighting with supplies of weapons and fighters to the rebels. Moscow denies that. Now the Americans say they may send arms to the Ukrainian government. For now, the big question is what are the latest aims and thoughts of the man in charge here in the Kremlin? Any cease-fire will hinge on the ability of the international community to control Russia’s communications with the separatists regions of Ukraine. That is a clear stumbling block for Russia here. If there is no diplomatic way forward, the West’s relations with Moscow, already the worst since the end of the Cold War, will surely slump further. Nick Childs, BBC News. The flurry of diplomatic activity has been prompted by the worrying way the conflict has recently spiralled after rebel leaders declared an offensive apparently to extend beyond the areas they already hold. As you heard in Nick’s report, this week the rebels virtually encircled government troops in the key railway hub of Debaltseve. Before the cease-fire was declared, our correspondent, james Reynolds, sent this report. Ukraine holds this town of Debaltseve but it’s facing real problems here keeping its ground. It’s facing rebels on three sides outside this town and it’s only got one road in to supply this town. Every few seconds, every few minutes here, we hear the sound of outgoing fire and also the dull sound of incoming fire. Not many people are left in this town. There are a few people, I suppose they are refugees essentially, they are waiting to get out of their home town. They are waiting to be escorted out by the Ukrainian military to safety on about a 20/30 minute journey out there. Other people are choosing to live in bomb shelters. In this particular building, there’s a family deciding to live deep down in the basement- that’s the safest place for them. But if I walk with you here, if we swing around, look how empty this is. This is now almost too dangerous for civilians to live in and going on the roads, you see soldiers and troops trying to hold this position for Ukraine. Ukraine has suggested that it will find it very difficult to win the war against Russia and Russian-backed rebels, unless it gets better weaponry. And it wants the United States to supply those weapons as here it tries to hold its ground. Our senior news correspondent, Christian Fraser, is here. So, the French and German leaders are in Moscow. What is it that President Putin wants? Angela Merkel and President Hollande are travelling with a revised draft to Moscow of a nine-page plan that President Putin sent to them. We don’t fully know what his intentions are. No-one really knows outside the Kremlin. We can take a good guess, given the escalation in the fighting in the past two weeks, and particularly the fighting in that strategic port. We could guess that he wants to chew off a significant enclave in eastern Ukraine. Some of the commentators, those who know how Moscow thinks, believes President Putin wants a frozen conflict, whereby in exchange for a cease-fire, everybody would hold what they have, there would be status quo, perhaps policed by a UN force. Now, that might not make much sense to the West. It may not be satisfactory to Kiev. But it may be what Europe has to accept, given there is no prospect of NATO putting boots on the ground inside Ukraine. What are the chances of Kiev accepting something like that? Well, it would be very difficult. It is not what the fighters on the ground want, the separatist rebels want full independence. The ground troops want full sovereignty. wa nt full sovereignty. We have want full sovereignty. We have seen it before. There is a precedent for this. We have seen it before. There is a precedent forthis. Remember precedent for this. Remember Moldova, South precedent forthis. Remember Moldova, South Ossetia, Ukraine is a different prospect. It is much bigger. You would have tens of thousands of people who would feel themselves on the wrong side, that would be very difficult to police and politically difficult in Kiev. What are the alternatives? The Americans are saying they are prepared to arm the Ukrainians with much heavier weapons. We have heard some strong rhetoric from Moscow in the past week about how dangerous that would be. If they did arm the Ukrainians, the Americans and the Europeans would have to be in for the long-haul with a war in Europe that could go on and on. A former doctor has been found guilty of indecently assaulting a number of young girls at the same hospital where jimmy Savile abused some of his victims. 79-year-old Michael Salmon worked as a consultant at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire during the 1970s and ‘80s. Duncan Kennedy is at Reading Crown Court. Michael Salmon was a highly respected consultant paediatrician but today he was found guilty of II counts of indecent assault and rape against his own child patients. Also, remarkably, his crimes were taking place at the same time and same place asjimmy Savile’s offences, Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. My report contains some flash photography. Michael Salmon was a consultant who regarded himself, in the words of the prosecution, as bomb-proof, above the law, able to abuse young girls over two decades at Stoke Mandeville Hospital. It was exactly the same time and the same place thatjimmy Savile was abusing his victims. The court heard that Salmon didn’t carry out his abuse in concert with Savile, but he is the first person from Stoke Mandeville to be charged under Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police inquiry into Savile’s activities. Salmon’s police interview reveals the same kind of arrogance shown by Savile to his victims. I think they’re gold-diggers. Why do you think they’re gold-diggers? I can’t think of any other reason why they would have done this. What I have heard today is an absolute - I have to be careful what I say - tissue of lies. Both Salmon and jimmy Savile’s abuse went undetected at Stoke Mandeville for years. Staff who worked there say Salmon was above suspicion. I never heard of from any member of staff, or personally knew of any of this behaviour. But at the time, when I was told about it, I was told it was about pornographic images on his computer in his outpatient clinic. That was all I was aware of up until- it was after I left the hospital that I knew there was more to it than that. Child welfare groups say it’s staggering that two paedophiles, Salmon and Savile, could both be operating separately at Stoke Mandeville. It’s quite chilling to think that these two men were working at Stoke Mandeville at the same time. There is no suggestion from this case that they were working in parallel, or working together. Clearly, there are questions to be asked about Stoke Mandeville. What was happening in that hospital at that time? How were children being looked after? Who knew what? Who was being responsible? Thames Valley Police say more victims have come forward during Salmon’s trial and say he, like jimmy Savile, betrayed the most vulnerable in what should have been a place of professionalism and safety. There’s been no response so far from Stoke Mandeville about all this. We know that the report into jimmy Savile’s offences at that hospital is due out in the next few weeks. As for Michael Salmon, he is most likely to be sentenced some time next week. Thank you. A British Islamist extremist, who travelled to Syria and then faked his own death to get back into the UK, has been sentenced to 12 years. Imran Khawaja, who’s from London, was arrested in Dover last summer. He admitted a string of terror offences, and apologised for his actions. Daniel Sandford reports. Imran Khawaja, a former immigration centre guard from West London who travelled to Syria to train as a terrorist. Today, the judge ruled that he still poses a serious risk to the public and jailed him for 12 years. In Syria, Imran Khawaja has joined an English language propaganda group, closely linked to Islamic State. He posed with guns. Here he can be seenin He posed with guns. Here he can be seen in the greenjacket on the left. The judge said that although he may not have taken part in combat in Syria, he assisted the fighters and glorified their conduct. Police say he was one of the most prolific English language propagandists for Islamic State. When he returned to Britain, his group faked his death saying he had been killed in battle. United -- saying he had been killed in battle. United -- it was a lie. His cousin, who drove to Serbia to collect him, was sentenced to 21 months in prison for assisting an offender. And Danieljoins me now from outside Woolwich Crown Court. The cousin who assisted him also got a jail sentence? Yes, this shows the difficult position that these families of men who have travelled to Syria find themselves in. In this case, Imran Khawaja’s sister and his mother and his cousin all knew where he was and they all knew what he was doing because he was sending them pictures of him holding guns, but they chose not to go to the police, rather they chose to persuade him to come home. There is a whole series of text messages and messages using various social media applications that the court has been shown. Eventually, when he does agree to come home, his cousin drives halfway across Europe to pick him up, but he hasn’t told the police about what he is doing so when he arrives at Dover, and he is arrested, rather than him being praised for him having helped to return somebody from Syria, he’s found himself being arrested and had to plead guilty to assisting an offender and is now facing 21 months in prison. These families are in very difficult situations. Radical changes to the way the NHS in England is organised have been ""disastrous"" and ""distracted"" from patient care. That’s according to a leading health think-tank, the King’s Fund, which says the changes have wasted billions of pounds. But it does welcome a recent shift by ministers to focus on patient safety. Our health correspondent, Dominic Hughes, reports. Doctors who knew what services their patients need, but today’s report said the result was a massive overhaul in the way the NHS in England was run. Instead of cutting bureaucracy, the King’s Fund said made things worse. All this, at a time of increasing demands and increasing financial pressures. The reforms have had a damaging impact on the NHS through massive organisational change. Leaders have been distracted by the structures rather than improve patient care. That has cob r contributed to declieping performance, which patients are experiencing. -- declining performance. Contributing to problems with finances and patient care. It rejects claims the NHS was opened up to privatisation. Some GPs say the changes that put them at the heart of the health service are bringing benefits to patients. What we have now is a commissioning system built around clinical leadership. For patients, that means GPs are at the heart of their community, who have often been there for decades, are planning local care services. What we must not do is change that. We must allow that to develop. The King’s Fund said it is right the focus has shifted to improving patient quality of care, with more people treated at home than at hospital. A spoke man forjeremy Hunt recognised the integrated care. There is this plea from a former Conservative Health Secretary to think about patients rather than management structures. We let them down if we play political games, rhetoric, for example, about privatisation. That’s a political gain and is identified as such by the King’s Fund. What we should do is focus on the care that is delivered to the people who rely on these services. The warning in today’s report is to all politicians, be very weary of further big top-down reorganisations. Spending using contactless payment cards more than trebled last year. In some stores, contactless payments are taking over from cash. Our personal finance correspondent, Simon Gompertz, is here. Simon, for those who have not used it yet, what is contactless and how does it work? Instead of using cash or using your card and inserting it into a machine and keying in a In. You wave the card over the console and the payment is taken. That is as long as your card is enabled. It has a special of logo which means it can be used and the usage has expanded rapidly over the past year. As you said, it has gone up three-fold and the total 2.3 billion over the last year. And that’s partly because the banks have been issuing more of these cards. There are 58 million contactless cards out there at the moment. That is a lot. It is also because, for instance the Tube and the buses in London, you can use it there. That is rippling out across the country, in Manchester, the tram for instance, you will be able to use your cards contactlessly from next year. Is there any danger your card may be debted without you knowing? People are worried about this. Either in a shop or a fraudster. What the banks say is take it out of your purse or your wallet and use it separately because you may have several contactless cards and they may get mixed up. Fraud is very low on this. It is expected that the usage willjust grow and grow. Some shop, the fast ones where they are taking a sandwich for you or something else it is 50-60% contactless now. Our top story this lunchtime. Simon, for those who have not used it yet, what is contactless and how The leaders of Germany and France are in Moscow for talks to try to end the spiral of violence in eastern Ukraine.

On sale - bidding for the Premier League’s lucrative live television rights begins today In the sport, defending champion Lee Westwood shares the clubhouse lead after a second round of 67 at the Open. He’s level with Alejandro Canizares on 11-under par. The low-cost retailer Poundland says it wants to buy the 99p chain of stores for £55 million, subject to approval by competition authorities. The two firms have signed a conditional deal. It includes over 250 99p shops across the UK, serving two million customers a week. Victoria Fritz reports. Infor In fora In for a penny, in for a In fora penny, in fora pound. From meat to mops. And everything between, you can buy a lot in a 99 p store. Poundland is looking to spend 55 million to take over its cheaper competitor. Poundland says the deal would provide better choice, value and service for its rival’s customers. The combined group would have more than 800 stores across Europe. The vast majority of which are here on British high streets. So, it is not surprising that the competition authority is going to be looking at this deal and that’s a process which could take two months. We have seen some big names go under on our high streets in recent years and the likes of Poundland took over many of the sites left vacant when Woolworths went bust. Today, this retailer is a £1 billion business. Even the supermarkets have not been immune to the rise and rise of the discounters. But consumers have more money in their pockets, thanks to low fuel and food prices. So, will the lure of spending around pound still be attractive now things are on the up? Shopping is habit-forming. Once we get used to doing something that is what we will continue to do. Now we know that is an open opportunity for us, we can have those products, access at that price, why give that up until we get a better price on them Bargain hunting, a national pastime, here to stay. This deal comes at a cost, customers in future may have to pay an extra penny on their purchases. Victoria Fritz, BBC News. The sale of the Premier League’s lucrative live television rights begins today, with the top clubs set for a windfall of up to ill billion. The auction covers the seasons from 2016 to 2019, and fierce competition between broadcasters could result in the price they pay for each match reaching £8 million. Our Business Editor, Kamal Ahmed, is here. These are huge sums we are talking about. Who’s in the running for the rights? Well, when it comes to the battle for Premier League it is a mug’s game predicting who might be in it. It is a very secretive process - sealed bids. There’ll be a lot of nervous executives wondering if their bids which have gone in today to the Premier League will be successful. If you think back to what happened in 2012, we must imagine that BT and Sky, who are the wig holders of rights at the moment -- big holders of rights at the moment will be in their bidding. In 2012, nobody predicted BT would come in and seize so many of the rights. This year it seems there is speculation that Discovery, the owner of Euro-sport could be in their bidding. I spoke to Lord Grade, who was chairman of ITV when they won the rights to champion’s league football, he said don’t rule out a left-field candidate like Apple or Google. One thing we can be certain of is whatever happens the price will go up and that means it will be more expensive to watch football for football fa ns in will be more expensive to watch football for football fans in the UK. Many thanks. A court has ruled against the listening agency GCHO for the way it shared material about communications data. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal said that until recently, the agency’s actions didn’t comply with human rights law as they lacked transparency. But it ruled that their procedures were now legal. The number of people with mental health problems locked up in police cells overnight is a ""scandal,"" according to MPs. The Home Affairs Committee says the NHS is failing to provide enough facilities. Last year, 6,000 people were detained under the Mental Health Act in police cells, although guidance says that should happen only on an ""exceptional basis"". Our Home Affairs Correspondent, june Kelly, reports. Police in the West Midlands responding to a MEPPal health emergency. MEPPal -- responding to a MEPPal health emergency. MEPPal -- mental health mergesy. Mental health is described as the number one priority for officers. This includes a medical professional. It is part of a pilot project known as Street Triage. The team back at base, a paramedic working with them. Today’s report calls for a complete re-think in the way mental health emergencies are dealt with. As with the system here, it wants the NHS to do more. The report says too many people detained with psychiatric problems are ending UP with psychiatric problems are ending up in police cells. 25-year-old james was held in a cell in 2010. Detained under the Mental Health Act, he was put in leg restraints and handcuffs. No medical assistance was called until he was carried into a police custody suit A5 minutes later. He suffered a heart attack before the medics arrived. He later died. Police cells are not an appropriate place of safety for somebody in a mental health crisis. The lights are bright. If someone is suffering from paranoia, you can imagine it would be lethal. Today’s report said the NHS is failing to provide enough places of safety, like these small units, designed to assess psychiatric conditions. The police service shouldn’t be filling gaps in mental health services, says one senior officer who specialises in this field. We don’t put any other problem with medical problems in custody because of their medical problems. People sometimes go in when they are unwell, that is also because they have offended. Mental health is where we are incarcerating people on the grounds where they are mentally ill. It is a meed evalue way to deal with people. The Home Secretary said the Government was already working to reduce the numbers ending up wrongly in police custody. june Kelly, BBC News.

The Six Nations tournament kicks off this evening, with Wales taking on England in the opening match at the Millennium Stadium. The last time the two sides met in Cardiff, Wales clinched a record win over England winning 30-3. Our Sports Correspondent, Olly Foster, is at the Millennium Stadium. What a match we have to start this Six Nations Championship. As if Wales against edge didn’t mean enough already. Remember, it is a World Cup here. These two nations have been drawn to face each other in that as well. 24 hours ago one of the Wales coaches, Sean Edwards, he turned up the heat on this fixture by publicly wafrning match officials that England may be breaking the rules in the way that they play. It is quiet at the moment at the Millennium Stadium. When England arrive they have to work out some way of calming the Cardiff core coughny. Defeat was deafening for England last time they were here. A record win for Wales saw them roar to the six nation’s title. Wales, to the title. It was two years ago when England triumphed at Twickenham last year. Wales are tipped to win tonight. I would rather be famous than underdogs. You work hard to get to number one and try to be the best team. When you get given that, it is something I quite enjoy. All your hard work pays off. It of pays off if you get the win. England insists the roof stays open tonight to keep the volume down. The noise seems to be the least of their worries with an injury list which has grown by the day. We are confident in our squad. We are confident in the guys, whether it is guys who have trained in previous camps. They have an opportunity to really come here and grab it with both arms, don’t they? And really ExCel. England have missed out on points difference for the past two championships. Ireland were victors last year. A trip to Italy should see them make a winning start. It feels special. This week is the one week where every team has a chance and dreams of the Grand Slam. Nobody has lost a game at this stage. Everyone is full of hope and everyone is full of that ambition. Scotland have perhaps more realistic ambitions that previous years. They scared the All Blacks a couple of months ago. They will look for a finish closer to the top than the bottom of the title. They have a tough opening match in Paris. From London, Rome and here in Cardiff, the rugby fans love this championship. Cheers and souvenirs for them. championship. Cheers and souvenirs forthem. Forthe nations championship. Cheers and souvenirs for them. For the nations involved, something priceless - for them. For the nations involved, something priceless - this trophy at the end of it.

Our top story today: The leaders of Germany and France are in Moscow for talks to try to end the spiral of violence in eastern Ukraine. In a moment, we’ll have a full national weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first, with all the day’s sport, here’s Hugh Wuzencroft at the BBC Sports Centre. The president of Ghana’s Football Association has told the BBC that supporters ‘could have died’ in crowd trouble which marred the Africa Cup of Nations semi-final in Malabo last night. Play was stopped for 30 minutes as home fans rioted in a match where Ghana beat hosts Equatorial Guinea 3-0. Here’s our sports correspondent, Andy Swiss. It was the catalyst for chaos. It’s 3-O! The goal which ended Equatorial Guinea’s hopes and prompted violence from their supporters. Moments later, Ghana’s fans spilled on to the pitch, trying to escape missiles raining down from the stands. The match was halted and as police used tear gas and a helicopter to try to restore order, the BBC’s commentary team was forced to flee. There are fans coming through the police barriers in front of us. This is probably about the time that we should leave. We will have to go off air. Take care. The Ghanaian FA compared it to a war zone with fans injured by missiles, including rocks, bottles and glass. As the home supporters continued their violence, Ghanaian fans scrambled on to buses to escape. Four of my colleagues, their head was broken. So we couldn’t stand it anymore. They had cuts. Their head and eyes were bleeding. It is uncalled for. So a tournament which began smoothly is ending in recrimination. The focus should be on Ghana’s win. Now, we are talking about violence. It is very unfortunate. The government of Equatorial Guinea has done very well, this is a big slur on the competition. For Ghana, a night in which celebrations on the pitch were overshadowed by turmoil off it. Andy Swiss, BBC News. 2015 is proving an even tougher year for Tiger Woods. He’s been forced to pull out of the Farmers Insurance Open in California after experiencing back problems. The 14-time major winner was 2-over par when he abandoned his first round afterjust 11 holes. His shortened round ended with a double bogey. It comes after his worst ever round of 11-over par at the Phoenix Open last week. ~ I was ready to go. I had a good warm-up session. Then we stood out here and I got cold. Everything started deactivating again. It is frustrating that I can’t stay activated. It’s the way it is. Lee Westwood is the clubhouse leader after his second round 67 at the Malaysian Open. The defending champion shot a 5-under round of 67 to head the field alongside Alejandro Canizares of Spain. Graham McDowell, who held the overnight lead alongside Westwood, didn’t fair so well. He made three bogeys and a double bogey to slip to 5-under, six shots off the pace. Skiing legend Bode Miller is facing the end of his season and possibly his career after he crashed out of the Men’s Super G at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Colorado. The 37-year-old American has since had surgery on a severed hamstring tendon. A four-time World Champion and Winter Olympic Gold medallist, Miller was competing for the first time since an operation on a herniated disc in his back in November. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. Children adopt foreign accents very easily, but what about chimpanzees? Well, nine chimps who were moved to Edinburgh Zoo five years ago from Holland used to use a high-pitched noise to ask for apples. Now they’ve started to use low grunts, just as their Scottish counterparts do. Here’s our Scotland Correspondent Laura Bicker. Meet Louis, he lives in Edinburgh Zoo and likes to eat apples. His new Dutch friend, Paul, is also fond of them. This is the sound he used to make when asking for an apple. But after a few years, with his Scottish chimp family, Paul has learned to ask for it their way. To human ears the grunts may sound quite similar. Researchers say finding out chimps can learn each other’s sounds is a breakthrough. It is not clear at the moment, and we need more research to find out whether or not before they started matching calls, could they understand one and other? Is this like me learning the French word for apples, so I can communicate with a French person? Or is it like me moving to Glasgow and after five years I start speaking with a Glaswegian accent? The idea that the Dutch chimps speak with a Scottish accent certainly entertained visitors. That’s absolutely bizarre! It’s hilarious! My goodness! It is great to hear them as well. I am just listening out for the och aye. This research suggests that our ancestors’ behaviour is far more similar to our own than originally thought, and it helps explain what’s so special about human communication. The ability to talk to one and other developed as the two groups from different countries bonded. And it’s come as no surprise to the keepers that it all started over an apple. Chimps do have a sweet tooth. They love fruit, much more than vegetables, which I think we can all understand why. And particularly apples, chimps seem fond of them, so they get excited when we feed them. It seems that the new arrivals have even developed a taste for porridge. As these guys are vegetarian, haggis is definitely off the menu. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Edinburgh. Fascinating. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Sarah Keith-Lucas. Which have a big contrast in the weather today. That is shown by the satellite image. Cloudier and weather today. That is shown by the satellite image. Cloudierand mild conditions across Northern Ireland, Scotland and the far North of England, but further south, colder and brighter conditions. Where we have that sunshine, also a bitter wind coming in from the north-east, so temperatures 4 to 6 Celsius. Add on the wind chill, it will feel sub-zero. Temperatures on the thermometer reading around 4 to 7 Celsius across-the-board. Through the course of this afternoon, clear skies persist in the south. Gradually, cloud starts to creep south from further north. If you are lucky to be heading to Cardiff, quite a chilly evening to come, 2 or 3 Celsius. Clear at first, but then that cloud pushes in. The cloudy and milder conditions in the north creep south. Across the far south, we could have a widespread frost. This is where we are keeping the clear skies for longest. Also, a bit of frost across central belt of Scotland. For most places on Saturday, the temperatures are just above freezing. At 9.00am, the cloud will bring a few light spots of drizzle. Most places will be dry. The breeze should ease through the day. Further north, one or two freezing fog patches here at first. Where we do get some patches of fog, they could be slow to clear. Equally, some sunny spells across many parts of Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. Windy conditions for the far north of Scotland. Elsewhere, lighterwinds Scotland. Elsewhere, lighter winds and Scotland. Elsewhere, lighterwinds and a different-feeling day. More in the way of cloud than we are seeing today. That cloud will bring some drizzle here and there. The best of the sunshine for Northern Ireland and Scotland. We have this area of high pressure in charge of our weather. That is not shifting away for a while. Not a great amount of change as we look through Sunday. We could start with a few spots of frost and some freezing fog. Some sunny spells in the east. Generally, fairly cloudy. Temperatures up to 7 or 8 Celsius. On into next week, we have still got that high pressure. Mainly dry, quite a bit of cloud around. 5 to 7 Celsius or so. So, we have lost the frost and fog and the wintry weather of the past few weeks, for now. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: Trying to end the violence in Ukraine - the leaders of Germany and France are in Moscow for talks to end the conflict. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Victoria Hollins. Scotland Yard has spent around £10 million on the police operation outside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London - where the WikiLeaks founder, julian Assange, has taken refuge. He’s been sheltering inside the building in Knightsbridge since losing an appeal against extradition to Sweden. Let’s get more on this from Alice Bhandhukravi, who’s at Scotland Yard this lunchtime. This £10 million is being spent on a 24 hour guard at the Embassy at Knightsbridge. To remind you of why he is there - he’s denied allegations that he sexually assaulted two women in Sweden. He faces arrest if he _ assaulted two women in Sweden. He faces arrest if he leaves the Embassy. We understand from police that betweenjune Embassy. We understand from police that between june 2012 and Embassy. We understand from police that betweenjune 2012 and October last year, the direct policing costs were £7.3 million. Then £1.8 million spent on overtime. Then in the last three months, that figure has topped £10 million. Has there been any reaction to those figures? The Deputy Prime Minister has said that Mr Assange should face justice in Sweden. Today, we have tried to speak to the Met Police, the Home Office, the Foreign Office, to find out how long they anticipate the situation going on for. We have had this statement from the Foreign Office: We remain as committed as ever to reaching a diplomatic solution. We are clear that our laws must be followed and Mr Assange should be extradited to Sweden. As ever, we look to Ecuador to help bring this difficult and costly situation to an end. Thank you. London based accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers is accused of promoting tax avoidance ""on an industrial scale"". The accountancy firm is said to have helped hundreds of clients cut their tax bills by setting up bases in Luxembourg. The Public Accounts Committee labelled the evidence it was given ""misleading"". PwC said it disagreed with the report but added the tax system was ""too complex"". Pricewaterhouse Coopers appeared to have misled Parliament because they came to Parliament not so long ago and said, ""We do not mass market tax products, we do not produce tax products, we do not promote tax products."" Yet what was uncovered from this leak was what I would call tax avoidance on an industrial scale. Tower Hamlets Council is to move its headquarters to the old Royal London Hospital building in Whitechapel. The council’s believed to have paid around £9 million for the building which has been empty since the new hospital was built. The council says it will save millions of pounds in rent that it’s paying for its current town hall in east London. A driver whojumped the red lights at a level crossing in Enfield has been fined almost £900, and been given nine points on his licence. Hassan Oner was caught on camera driving over the crossing at Enfield lock while the lights were flashing red. British Transport Police has increased its patrols at level crossings across the country. The Mayor is going to America to bolster support for London’s science and technology industries. Borisjohnson will arrive in Boston on Sunday and then head to New York City and Washington. He’ll meet New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, as well as the city’s senior police officer Bill Bratton to discuss how the city is tackling increased fears about terrorism. Now the weather with Georgina Burnett. Good afternoon. Well, with high pressure in control for a good week or so, we are entering a rather settled period, but this afternoon, we continue with these sunny spells, but that bighting north-easterly wind as well. Tsh biting north-easterly wind as well. Temperatures getting up to 5 or 6 Celsius. As we head towards the evening, we have clear skies to start off with. It does cloud over from the north-west as we head to the early hours of the morning. We may get one or two spots of drizzle first thing. For many, the temperatures will stay above freezing for tonight. Tomorrow, we have quite a lot of cloud around to start off the weekend. The winds have eased through the night. So, for tomorrow, we have lighter winds. There will be a bit more in the way of drizzle, not necessarily all seeing that. It will be feeling damper. Temperatures reaching 6 Celsius for tomorrow. And then a frosty start to Sunday. But a fair amount of cloud still around. There may be a few breaks in the afternoon. As we head into Monday and Tuesday, we are holding on to a lot of that cloud as well. But, feeling quite settled generally. We may have some fÂÂÂv settled generally. We may have some foggy nights, though, perhaps some frosty starts as well. The temperatures are feeling that bit more healthy with highs of 7 or 8 Celsius over the next few days. ",,

So if you fancy yourself as a budding author and want to read with royalty, you can enter via the Radio 2 website. But for now, from us all, have a very good afternoon. Celsius over the Also tonight: A former children’s doctor is convicted of sexually abusing young girls at the same hospital where jimmy Savile worked. Billions of pounds wasted on a misguided reorganisation - independent health experts condemn the coalition’s changes to the NHS. Why so many of us are paying with contactless cards - transactions have tripled over the last year. And Wales and England prepare for their Six Nations kick-off. On BBC London: The cost of policing the Wikileaks founder, julian Assange, reaches £10 million. And how a loophole in the law could see London getting more council- run schools. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Tonight, intense diplomatic efforts are underway in Moscow to try to bring an end to the fighting in Ukraine. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French President, Francois Hollande, are holding crisis talks with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. The conflict has claimed the lives of nearly 5500 people since April. And it’s estimated that around 1.5 million people have left their homes to escape the fighting. In a moment, the latest on the ground in east Ukraine, but first Sarah Rainsford sent this report from the Russian capital. Escaping to safety after weeks under heavy shelling. Many of these people had been sheltering in basements, as fierce fighting raged around them. For the first time, Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian rebels agreed a cease-fire today, a corridor out for civilians from a town under siege. The leaders of France and Germany want to make that cease-fire permanent. They have flown to Moscow after long talks in Kiev, trying to mediate, seeking compromise. But they were cautious about their chances. President Putin still denies evidence that Russia is arming the separatist rebels, or sending troops to support them. Pro Russian rule Bulls have controlled parts of eastern Ukraine for months. Many say they want independence from Kiev, but the Ukrainian government refuses to give up sovereignty. It worries that the rebels will push for more land, and fixing a cease-fire line is key to any peace deal. In Moscow, volunteers were collecting aid for eastern Ukraine, four fights and civilians. Everything from food and toys to military uniforms. In the West, the war is seen clearly as Russian aggression, but this man portrays it is the opposite. TRANSLATION: Eastern Ukraine is not another planet. People there speak Russian, they are Russian, and war has been declared against them. People are dying there every day and we have to help them. So he and his friends drive this into rebel territory themselves. This shows how much support there is in Russia for Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, and the rebel fighters who are seen as protecting them. That is how the conflict has or has been portrayed here in Russia and it is why negotiations to end it now are going to be so difficult. -- negotiations to end it now are going to be so difficult. -- has always been portrayed. Russian support for the separatists has driven relations with the West to their worst since the Cold War. If the push for peace does not work, there is talk of the US sending arms to Ukraine. Russia has warned of catastrophic consequences. There is a group of advisers here that would advocate escalating in that particular case, they would advocate matching de-escalation by the United States, should the US decide to provide those arms. That is a possibility. More than 5000 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine. The violence is widespread, damage indiscriminate. On the ground, there is pessimism about any peace deal, but the stakes for everyone are rising. james Reynolds is in Donetsk. The talks are taking place in Moscow but it is where you are that peace is needed urgently. Yes. The war continues. We heard about that short cease-fire, when several hundred civilians were removed to safety, but the truce has not spread. The war continues. In Donetsk, the rebel heartland, the rebels have been building the trappings of power. They have a border crossing, flags and insignia. And along the main avenue, their police are patrolling the streets. This will make it much harder for world the streets. This will make it much harderfor world leaders in Moscow to reach the kind of deal which would appeal to the rebels here and also to Kiev, Ukraine on the other side. Because Ukraine is worried about the gains made by rebels here, and artillery fire has continued in the distance. Thank you. A former children’s doctor has been found guilty of raping and sexually abusing a number of young girls at the same hospital where jimmy Savile abused some of his victims. 79-year-old Michael Salmon worked as a consultant at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire during the 1970s and 80s. Duncan Kennedy is at the hospital this evening. Michael Salmon was a doctor and consultant here for nearly 20 years. He was highly regarded and highly trusted, but in the end that trust was completely abused. Tonight, the local health authority said it took his case extremely seriously and had cooperated with police. Michael Salmon had carried out his crimes at the same time and place asjimmy Savile. I must warn you there is flash photography in my report. Michael Salmon, who is 80 years old, abused and raped his own child patients. Often behind curtains or doors, with parentsjust a few patients. Often behind curtains or doors, with parents just a few feet away. Prosecutors said he regarded himself as bombproof, someone who was above the law. Today, 30 years on, he faced justice. All these victims were children in the 1980s. They were children that put their trust in him, parents put their trust in him. Michael Salmon abused his patients at the same time and place thatjimmy Savile his patients at the same time and place that jimmy Savile assaulted his victims. Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the 1970s and 1980s. Michael Salmon was not acting with jimmy Savile but was arrested under Operation Yewtree, the police enquiry into him. In police interviews, he revealed the same contempt thatjimmy interviews, he revealed the same contempt that jimmy Savile had shown his victims. I think they are gold-diggers. Why? I can’t think of any other reason why they have done this because what I have heard today is an absolute... I have to be careful what I say. A tissue of lies. Both Michael Salmon and jimmy Savile were praised by the Royal family for their work at Stoke Mandeville and elsewhere. Former staff at the hospital who knew him well say that they never suspected anything. I never heard from any member of staff or personally knew of any of this behaviour. But at the time when I was told about it, I was told it was about pornographic images on his computer in his outpatient clinic. That was all I was aware of up until after I left the hospital, when I knew there was more to it than that. Tonight, child welfare groups say it is incredible that one hospital was targeted by two major paedophiles. Both independently preying on their victims. It is quite chilling to think that these two men were at Stoke Mandeville at the same time. There is no suggestion that they were working in parallel, working together, but clearly there are questions to be asked about Stoke Mandeville. Michael Salmon was jailed for three-year ‘s in 1990 for similar offences, and was struck off. His victims will discover next week the sentence he will face for the crimes they suffered. The coalition government’s reorganisation of the NHS was ""misguided"" and cost billions of pounds that could instead have been spent on patient care, according to a damning report from a leading think tank. The King’s Fund said that only in the last two years have ministers managed to shift the focus from structural reform of NHS to patient safety. Downing Street said it did not accept the overall picture of the NHS painted in the report. Here’s Hugh Pym. It was a highly controversial set of reforms, one of the biggest shake-ups in the history of the NHS. Now, a respected think tank has branded this government’s changes as damaging and distracting, creating fractured leadership in the health service, resulting in billions of pounds being wasted. In the first three-year ‘s, the government focused too much on organisational change, creating a system not fit for purpose, which was distracting and mental patient care took second place. Today, the Labour leader, latching onto those conclusions, pointed the finger at the Prime Minister. The responsibility goes directly to the door of David Cameron, and he should personally apologise to the British people for having betrayed their trust, let them down and damaged our National Health Service. The reforms, which took effect in England two years ago, saw control of commissioning budgets given to GP groups, public health response that it is moved to local government, and the abolition of Strategic Health Authority ‘s. This Notts GP heads up one of the new commissioning groups funding health care for the local community. He says the reforms have helped patients. We have seen real changes. Locally, we are getting back to community-based team is built around patients and general practice that we lost years ago, so we have seen improvements and we need to continue to develop that. Ministers were not available for interview but the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, the main architect of the policy, said that year long waiting times were eliminated, hospital infections dropped to their lowest levels ever and thousands of lives were saved from improved care and continue to be saved. The NHS is now judged to be the best health service in the world. These are difficult waters for the government and they have not directly engaged with the central conclusions of the report. But sources have noticed that the Kings fund does well, a shift away managerial changes in the last couple of years to focus more on patient care and safety. It also had a dig at labour, arguing that the party was exaggerating when it claimed the NHS was being privatised. The report will fuel the heated debate over whether the coalition partners have damaged or improved the health service. Mr Cameron wants to talk about current performance. Labour wants to performance. Labour wa nts to highlight performance. Labour wants to highlight the government’s full record. Overto highlight the government’s full record. Over to the voters. The extremist group Islamic State is claiming that a female American hostage they were holding has been killed in a coalition air strike in Syria. Images, which the BBC cannot confirm are authentic, have been posted online of what’s purported to show the site of the strike in the city of Raqqa, an IS stronghold. Let’s talk to our North America editor, jon Sopel. What light can you shed on this from where you are? We have known for some time that a US aid worker was being held but had agreed not to report it. We have just spoken to the White House national security spokesperson who gave a very brief statement. ""We are deeply concerned by these reports. We have not seen any evidence that corroborates Islamic State’s claim"". I think the claim needs a very big health warning attached to it. For a start, how convenient, just as jordan attached to it. For a start, how convenient, just asjordan is intensifying bombardments that it should claim this. Secondly, we have heard that only one person was killed in this air strike, no one else, just this aid worker. Where were the bodyguards? For that reason, I think we need to treat this with some caution. A British Islamic extremist who went to Syria and then faked his own death in order to return home, has beenjailed for 12 years. Imran Khawaja appeared in propaganda videos promoting so-called Islamic State. He was arrested last year on his return to England, and last month pleaded guilty to terror offences. Daniel Sandford reports. Imran Khawaja, who used to work in London immigration detention centre. But has now admitted travelling to Syria last year to train as a terrorist. This man was closely associated with Islamic State, who glorified any actions he was taking in Syria through social media back to the UK, and encouraged others, through social media, to come out and join him. Imran Khawaja has a low IO and no educational qualifications, and may not have actually fought in Syria. But he was close to the fighting and posed with heavy weapons, even the severed heads of Syrian soldiers. His family in west London were in touch with him throughout, and for months they begged him to come back. His sister was worried about their parents’ health. But Imran Khawaja messaged back: That meant he wanted to die a martyr. Eventually, he agreed to come back. His group posted a message on Instagram claiming he was dead to cover his tracks. But the police did not fall for it and he was arrested as he came off the ferry in Dover. He is now starting a 12-year prison term. Mrjustice Baker dismissed Imran Khawaja’s claim that he had returned to Britain because of concern for his family and because he had become disenchanted with Islamic State. The judge concluded that he still posed a significant risk to members of the public. To the family’s dismay, the judge also jailed Khawaja’s cousin for 21 months, because although he had gone to collect him, he had not told the police. Imran Khawaja, seen here on the far left, will not be released for at least eight years. Daniel Sandford, BBC News at Woolwich Crown Court. Our top story. President Hollande and Angela Merkel are in Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin, about a peace plan for Ukraine. And coming up. I will be live here pitchside at the Millennium Stadium, in Cardiff ahead ~ The pharmacist we exposed for selling potentially dangerous prescription-only drugs over the counter- a judge rules he was rightly struck off. And Arsenal’s jack Wilshere is been forced to apologise to his manager after this picture appeared on social media. Now, for some ""cash is king"", but for more and more of us ""put it on the plastic"" is the only way of shopping. And now the number of contactless card payments - that’s payments using cards with this symbol- has trippled. The BBC has learnt the success of the system means the payment limit will be raised later this year from £20 to £30. Our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz has more details. Contactless. In the bakers, the coffee shop, the grocers. More cards can do it. That is what the ripple logo means. Even in the pub more of us are letting our cards touch or hover, with no need to punch in a code. And here is is a street in Manchester where shops are finding that contactless cards are making inroads. In the bakers it’s always been cash, but now Glen and Emma, with their twins, leave their cash at home. Absolutely fantastic. Easiest way to pay for anything, to be honest. It is quicker to swipe it than put your number in. So that’s good for us, really. If somebody doesn’t take it, I have to go to the bank. I don’t get cash any more. Show us your wallet. What is in it? Any cash? 21 pence. Any notes? No. No cash, just contactless. Outside, Stewart still refers notes and coins. prefers notes and coins. It is his daughter who is keen on contactless. I am not entirely sure whether I trust them, to be honest. I prefer to pay cash. It is easier to understand how much I am spending if I draw a certain amount out of the bank. When that is gone, I know how much I have spent. Even so, traders are being led by their customers. So what is happening? I think society is just moving, and we have to move that way with them. There is a revolution in payment methods. These bakers helping the rise of contactless. Spending with the new cards multiplied one, two, three times last year. Taking the contactless total for 2014 to £2.3 billion, according to the UK Cards Association. What changes the mix is how many credit and debit cards can do it. That tally has shot up to 58 million cards. That is a lot of cards for making contactless purchases. What is holding it back, though, is that if your shopping basket costs more than £20 you can’t go contactless. We have learned the limit is being raised to £30 later this year. The result will be that a lot more shopping can be done with contactless cards. It isn’t yet the death of cash, but some shops are finding already that more than half of their takings are contactless. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. For the first time a British security services tribunal has ruled against GCHO. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal said until recently the agency had failed to comply with the law by not disclosing safeguards to protect the public. The court previously ruled the ways in which the agency carried out surveillance were legal. A police officer, who was under investigation by the police watchdog in relation to the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, has died after being hit by a car. South Yorkshire Police said lIlI-year-old PC Hassan Ali died today after he was knocked down while off duty in Sheffield last month. Nigel Farage has abandoned a public appearance in Rotherham because of protests outside his party’s office. The UKIP leader was due to cut a ribbon at the office of election candidate jane Collins. Around Ao demonstrators had gathered, prompting police to advise Mr Farage to call off the event. The low-cost retailer Poundland has always had an eye for a bargain. Now it’s buying up its high street rival, the 99p chain of stores. The deal’s worth £55 million and would add 250 stores to Poundland’s network of shops. The recession was a big factor behind Poundland’s rise. Our business correspondent Emma Simpson explains its continued popularity. At Pou ndla nd you At Poundland you don’t need to ask the price. Cheap, with no-frills. But its big business. From sweets to sock, Poundland offers a mix of products, for sure. Its stores thrived during the recession, and it continues to attract customers, including the more affluent shopper. We love the idea, it seems, of a bargain. I have dish soap, which is usually a good deal, and the Tupperware clip on lids, which are two for one. It is pretty good. I am going to get some nuts. I have come in for candles. Baked beans. Window cleaner and I am going out with a lot more! You go the shop and you think, I could do with one of then. You come in to spend a couple of pound and you go back out spending. Quite a few pounds. Poundland is on a spending spree as well. It hopes to buy its smaller rival 99 p Store, that would help it expand in the south. Infact, the whole discount market is on a roll. Not all national household names. Welcome to the fastest growing section of the high street. When the recession first hit shoppers started exploring these out of necessity. A lot have liked what they found. They are shopping out of preference, still a lot of shoppers are shopping to a tight budget. You walk into a Poundland with a £20 note. It is easy to understand. It is cheerio to the 99 pence stores if this gets approved. They will rebranded Poundland. A retailer that is fast becoming one of the biggest players on the height street.

England have even been training with the south sound of Welsh hymns blasting at them through speakers to prepare for this atmosphere. White shirted England kick off and the Slith rugger battle is on. At 125 meetings honours are almost even. England just one win ahead of Wales. The sound and spectacle have only increased. Playing at the Millennium Stadium stays with you for a decade. Suddenly it is all happen, and the volume and the emotion and people it just hits you. It is the most amazing feeling. It is an opportunity every player wants to grasp, at the school which produced Welsh captain Sam Warburton they know getting one on the neighbours still really matters. I think every schoolboy wants to play. It is the biggest rivalry for Welsh players and fans. The past we have conquered England but especially now they are favourites for the World Cup it will be a massive game. The two teams will go head-to-head again in September, in the World Cup. But tonight, all that matters is walking away with pride still intact. ~ I have been joined I have beenjoined pitchside by Sir Clive Woodward. It feels like the build up to the World Cup begins tonight. Forsure. 2012 build up to the World Cup begins tonight. For sure. 2012 was Olympic year, 20151 rugby year. This Six Nations is just a year, 20151 rugby year. This Six Nations isjust a prelude Nations is just a prelude to the World Cup. I think the England, Wales game is probably the biggest that in Six Nations. It is a wonderful start to what should be a great year. Who do you think will win, by how many and why? Wales come in as strong favourites. I think the pressure is on Wales. If Wales were to lose this game they will have a tough 2015. I think England come with everything to gain. I think they have a good side. If they come and play and I say really quickly, really take and play and I say really quickly, really ta ke it to and play and I say really quickly, really take it to the Welsh, there could be an upset. England have everything to gain. If we lose it wouldn’t be the end of the year for us, it would be a big lesson, so the pressure is on the Welsh. England could cause an upset. What will the atmosphere be like? I have played as a player. Coached. This is the best stage in the world for rugby. I feel privileged to be here, it is great for every player, this will be fantastic tonight. Thank you very much. Well, Friday night in Cardiff tend to be lively affairs at timings and never more so than this evening. -- times. Now the weather. It look like a good night at the Millennium Stadium. Itself will be dry but on the cold side. Hovering round 3 degrees so chilly but all in all a good night. Through the weekend, we have a lot of decent weather in the forecast. A lot of dry weather. Certainly nowhere near as cold, particularly in the south, and for some of us there will be some sunshine at times. It is quiet overnight. A bit of a Breeze in the north of Scotland. A bit of extra cloud and a few spots of rain. An area of cloud drifting away from northern England, bringing a few spots of drizzle. Maybe a bit of sleet. But it should be a lovely start to the day for many southern counties. Still cold and a bit breezy. Burr some sunshine nonetheless. You move further North into the Midlands, East Anglia, parts of Wales. A fair bit of cloud. But the western side of Wales should do well, with sunshine through the morning. It is a bright start for northern England, Northern Ireland and for the bulk of Scotland. Although still breezy and still the potential for the odd spot of rain. We will keep it fairly cloudy and breezy in the north of Scotland. Much of the northern half does well for much of the day. Further south, there is this area of cloud drifting southwards. The odd spot of drizzle but it won’t amount to much. A better feel to the day in the south. Six or seven degrees we have lost that nagging wind and six or seven further North. Second part of the weekend, looks good. We have this large area of high pressure that will dominate things. On into next week as well. There will be a fair bit of cloud round. But good breaks on Sunday. The best in the eastern side of Scotland, the North East of England. Elsewhere a fair bit of cloud. Most places fine and dry and not windy. Our main story.

Because that would be wrong! Welcome to the programme with me, Riz Lateef. The cost of policing the Ecuadorian Embassy in Knightsbridge, where Wikileaks founder julian Assange has taken refuge, has now topped £10 million. Met officers have been policing the building for over two and a half years. Mr Assange is wanted in Sweden over allegations he assaulted two women. The Deputy Mayor for Policing, Stephen Greenhalgh says the huge cost of the operation to Londoners is incredibly frustrating. But Britain’s commitment to international law means that the cost could keep on rising. Alice Bha nd hu kravi reports. He has been under constant guard since he set foot in this embassy. Officers poised to arrest him the minute he steps out. But that operation cost the Met £10 million over 1,000 days. £10 million could have funded almost 450 new police constables on a basic starting salary of £22,000. It is news that has caused consternation at a time of police cuts. Because the government cannot resolve a dispute with the Ecuadorians about this individual, we are spending £10 million of our resources that we need on our streets. It is no use for the government to shrug its shoulders, they need to pull their finger out and resolve the situation. He first made the news in 2010 when Wikileaks exposed thousands of US documents. He says he fears to be extradited to the United States, but it is in Sweden that he faces allegations of sexual assault made by two women there, allegations he denies. An international arrest warrant was made for him in November 2010. Mr Assange made a series of appeals against expedition which he eventually lost. But the Met find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place, obliged as it is to enforce the warrant for his arrest. We need a diplomatic solution. Either Mr Assange needs to go voluntarily or there needs to be some intervention to stop this impasse. It is a huge waste of money. But according to some academics, what is at stake is worth the cost of policing. It is not about an individual. He is a high-profile individual with a good degree of baggage, which we should not overlook, but our commitment to international law, upholding the law, matters for the UK as a whole. But London as we spoke to were split on the issue of balancing diplomatic immunity and the cost of policing. If that is the cost, we have to pay or we destroy human rights. 50 million people in this country. Is it worth the money? It is right that they look into it and whether it is really worth the money. So, Alice, where does this diplomatic dilemma go from here? It seems like a diplomatic impasse. The Foreign Office sent us a statement, saying, we remain as committed as ever to reaching a diplomatic solution.

BBC London has discovered that seven boroughs are exploiting a loophole in the law and plan to open 15 brand-new schools, paving the way for creating thousands of much-needed places. The Councils aim to use existing legislation which was designed to take away their control and encourage local communities to set up free schools and academies. Our Education Reporter Marc Ashdown explains. This is the boundary between three boroughs. Martin, Sutton and Croydon. All in the top ten of needing to create school places. It is a widely held view that local councils, not -- is a widely held view that local councils, not -- cannot build new schools. But Croydon is going to build new schools. How can that be? Legally, it is up to local authorities to educate every child. Coalition policy is that new schools must be out of council control. But we have discovered that councils can approach groups to open schools, seven are doing so and 50 new schools are doing so. There are hundreds of groups, parents, community groups, who want to improve education and work constructively. Councils need to work collaboratively with free schools and academies to set up new schools. What they cannot do when the school is set up is run them, but they can work to set them up. The founder of one new school thinks all sides should do more to set up new schools. That cannot be allowed to be a politicalfootball. It is children who will suffer as a result of a lack of cohesion. So collaboration, local authorities can be proactive in working with communities. Central government needs to ensure that those communities are being supported. Another bit of policy small print says that if no group comes forward to run a school, councils can run the school themselves. Clearly, to run a school, councils can run the schoolthemselves. Clearly, it is better that councils are in control of where the schools are openedin control of where the schools are opened in their burrows. They know best where schools are needed. So I encourage councils to work with academies and free school providers to find those 133,000 places we need. So they will be working to fill the gaps. A barrister has beenjailed for a hoax claiming there was a plot to kill the Queen at the London 2012 Olympics. Michael Shrimpton QC said German spies were keeping a smuggled nuclear warhead at an east London hospital. Sarah Harris has the story. Arriving at Southern Crown Court for his sentencing, Michael Shrimpton was found guilty of communicating false information last year. It was in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics that he made claims the opening ceremony would be the target of a nuclear attack. The judge said he saw no medical reason for this claim, but the 57-year-old just wanted to feel important. In sending Michael Shrimpton to prison, the judge said that it was important to bearin judge said that it was important to bear in mind that there was a real risk to the security of the Olympics and that anything that diverted the officials away from that task was to be taken seriously. Although he accepted that this barrister in this act had lost everything. It was the murky world of espionage that interested the barrister who lived in Buckinghamshire. He wrote a book called the Spy Hunter and this caused -- called the Spy Hunter and this caused -- this was the backdrop of the allegations he made. As Conservative headquarters in Bucks he asked to speak to the MP. Outside the office today, people felt the jail sentence wasjust. the office today, people felt the jail sentence was just. You jail sentence wasjust. You have to do that seriously. It could have caused world War three. A lotta people would take it seriously and would be worried. He should be held responsible for diversity resources from where they are needed. The bar standards said that their immediate suspension was in effect and they said they were investigating Mr Shrimpton in accordance with their fulsome processes. The judge said he would spend at least a year in prison to deter others. Ajudge at the High Court has ruled that a pharmacist exposed by BBC London for selling dangerous prescription-only drugs deserved to be struck off by the General Pharmaceutical Council. Hussain jamal Rasool, who was caught breaking the law by this programme, was banned for life and was seeking to overturn the decision. Guy Lynn conducted the investigation and joins us. Remind us of what your investigation found? Basically, he was the superintendent pharmacist at a pharmacy on the Edgeware Road in London. He was one of several pharmacists that we sold selling potentially dangerous drugs over the counter with no prescription, like they which are income. He sold as Viagra, he sold as Valium. This is the moment that he sold as a drop -- as Valium. This is the moment that he sold as a drop -- a drug containing morphine. He told our researcher to drink as much of it as he liked. And why did this end up in the High Court? The general pharmaceutical Council struck off this pharmacist in September as a direct result of this investigation. He has denied wrongdoing and he went to the High Court to appeal this decision. But today, thejudge to the High Court to appeal this decision. But today, the judge said he deserves to be struck off, that is behaviour was incompatible with being a pharmacist and how he was prepared to hand over these drugs to a random stranger, was shocking. This reminder of the moment that we had BBC London caught up with him. You have been selling dangerous drugs over the counter like the bars of chocolate, why? He was not the only one we exposed, we expose nine pharmacist. Three of them have been struck off, and the rest have been suspended temporarily or are about to have their hearings with the general pharmaceutical Council. A south London family say the condition of their severely autistic son has worsened after being forced to move repeatedly because of mistakes made by their local council. The Ganashens moved four times after Merton repeatedly miscalculated the family’s housing benefits. Merton has paid £300 in compensation, which the family has described as ""laughable"". The family at home, their fourth in 18 months. Tough for them all, toughest for their seven-year-old autistic son. The parents did not want in film, as it could upset him. At last we couldn’t cope completely because of this problem. He is seven years old, but he lost weight. When he got aggressive, his mother could not handle him. Repeated mistakes by Merton Council led them to this position. When his owner was repossessed, the council put him in a rental property but miscalculated his housing benefit. The father was working as a minicab driver but Merton Council did not consider his expenses when they worked out his housing benefit. Like road tax and fuel. That meant that he could not afford his rent. He had three appeals rejected and took the case for a tribunal. But then he was evicted for nonpayment of rent. The council called him intentionally homeless. They stayed in a B&B while they look for a new place. His son was admitted to hospital. Then the result of the tribunal, Merton had got it wrong. It was a laugh. Merton Council do not comment on decisions, but this is that every release omitting a claim should submit information that was accurate and on time. That is despite the tribunal showing that this information was accurate and on time. It is held that there are too many vulnerable families kept in the private rented centre when they should be given private -- centre when they should be given private -- stable accommodation. There are consequences for the child and for the parents who cannot carry on for their normaljob. In 20 years time, we will have a whole legion of children who have never known a stable and secure home. She has called this case the saddest she has seen. They are just looking forward to the future. Still to come this Friday evening: With Hollywood’s finest expected in London for this weekend’s BAFTAs, we’ll hear from the ceremony’s host, Stephen Fry. Now, all this week in our series Crowded Capital, we’ve been focusing on London’s booming population as it hit a record high of 8.6 million this week. City Hall figures estimate that by 2038, just over half the capital will be from a black or ethnic minority background. Nick Beake has been looking at the projections - borough by borough. London is changing fast. So are the faces of its people. You can see it here at Shepherd’s Bush market. Our city looks and sounds more diverse than ever. In some places, though, things have remained pretty much the same. My name is Laura, and I was born in London. I have lived in London all my life. I work in London and have a family business that was started by my dad in 1933. Some boroughs have seen relatively small numbers of newcomers. Bexley, Bromley, favouring and Richmond have the smallest proportion of black and ethnic minority residents. In other areas it is -- ethnic minority residents. In other areas it is -- 20%. In other areas it is more. My name is Tony and we have a great variety of people, we all get on, we have Lithuanians, and even a few Brazilians in the mix. New and Brent were the first London boroughs where black and ethnic minority residents became the majority, more than 50% of the local population. They were then joined majority, more than 50% of the local population. They were thenjoined by Tower Hamlets, Harrow, Ely and Redbridge. This part of Tower Hamlets has seen changes. Some say that immigration have brought issues that governments have not addressed. You have maybe more Bangladeshi in this area, Pakistani in this area, more Afro-Caribbean in this area, instead of mixing it a bit more. This seemed to go into one area. I was told that there are 172 different languages and dialects in Tower Hamlets alone. Obviously it makes it difficult, for education. I have brought my children up not to be prejudiced, but I think the government makes you. With what is going on around here. Back at the market in Shepherd’s Bush, we found a few of those concerns. I, I came from Lithuania a few years ago, and I enjoy London. All these boroughs are product-- projected to have a majority of Londoners of black messing minority residents. By 2013, -- by 2038, when Charlie is in his late 20s, half of all Londoners are respected come from a black or ethnic minority background. -- respected come from a black or ethnic minority background. -- are expected to come. And for more information on our series Crowded Capital, just head to our website, where there’s an in-depth look at London’s growing population, plenty of facts and figures there. That’s at the usual address. Let’s turn to the weekend sport now - and it’s over to Chris Slegg. Thanks very much. This weekend’s Premier League action gets under way with a north London derby at lunch-time tomorrow. Tottenham welcome Arsenal to White Hart Lane with both sides chasing a top-four finish. In the build-up to the game Arsenal midfielderjack Wilshere has apologised to manager Arsene Wenger after a picture of him holding a shisha pipe was posted on social media. The 23-year-old England international- who won’t play tomorrow as he continues his recovery from an ankle injury - has twice previously been reprimanded by Wenger for being photographed smoking. ~ I have spoken with him about that. He is not a smoker, but he is of course sorry for what happened. But it is down to him to master his life. One second of your life does not define who you are. At the other end of the table, QPR are yet to appoint a new manager but Tim Sherwood has been contacted by chairman Tony Fernandes about the vacancy. Sherwood remains favourite to succeed Harry Redknapp who resigned on Tuesday. The former academy coaches in temporary charge for the match against Southampton at Loftus Road. Now the Six Nations gets under way injust over an hour, and in rugby’s other code it’s also a big weekend. The Super League season began last night but for the first time in its 20-year history there’s no team from the capital involved. London Broncos were relegated last season. Ian Ramsdale looks at what that means for the club, and for the sport. Rugby league’s new Dawn says a Rugby lE8gUE’S VIEW DBWVI SBVS B VIEW structure but no super league opposition for London fans. It has been a long time for London to get back up. We are looking forward to winning a few games. A trophy has eluded the club since they began life in 1980 as full rugby league. The players train and lived in the north, but now a host of southern community clubs produce top-level talent. I have some league experience last year and I hope this yearl experience last year and I hope this year I can keep being kissed isn’t -- keep being consistent. There’s no doubt about it that you need a club playing at the highest level in London for all these aspiring youngsters to aim for. But there are a lot of positives to come out of this move, I think. The club’s relegation from the Super League was a low point in their history. Their high was a cup final in 1989. But now, with a former super league win on their roster, he is hoping to bring good times back. I with me being down here, the interest in the game is thriving. One step back, two steps forward if we can get foundations right. We have systems put in place but for us it is to go back and get started again and rebuild to make sure the structure and systems are right for London rugby league. The game’s national image will take a knock with no top-level southern club. So right now, maybe Super League needs London more than Super League needs London -- more than London needs Super League. Australian Open champion jordanne Whiley believes the best is yet to come from her and wheelchair doubles partner Yui Kamiji ofjapan. The 22-year-old, who lives in Ickenham, and her team-mate were match point down in the Australian Open final last week, before going on to win their fifth straight Grand Slam title. There is more potential there. I think in the final we were probably playing at about 60% to 70% of our potential. There is still more to work on and we are still winning. Closely, but still winning! Hopefully another successful year ahead forjordanne and Yui. And that’s all from me. The glitz and glamour of Hollywood arrive in London this weekend for the BAFTAs. British talent is leading the way with nominations for Eddie Redmayne, Bendedict Cumberbatch, and Rosamund Pike. It’s also a big night for Stephen Fry who’s hosting for the tenth time. Colin Patterson has been speaking to him and checking on how preparations for the ceremony are going. This awards season, with no’s acting talent has been dashing between ceremonies all over the US. This weekend, they get to come home. The red carpet is about to go down, giant master being polished and final of average and is made for Sunday night’s batters. Back to host for the 10th time, Stephen Fry. Please, stop! Oh, you have... I still get a real buzz from meeting proper. . Dustin Hoffman came up to me and said, I’m really sorry, will this embarrass you? And I thought, what is he going to say? My daughter is a fan, could she have an autograph? I couldn’t believe it! What if I reverse the process all the way back to see what happened at the beginning of time? We have got the battle of the boffins. Alan Turing against Stephen Hawking. It is only Eddie Redmayne against the Arabian Benedict Cumberbatch. They are both remarkable actors playing remarkable human beings. What is it that we will be doing? We will be breaking a Nazi code. O. A BAFTA triumph could provide a timely boost. But only one of the four winners last year went to repeat the feat at the Oscars. 69% of winners over the last ten years have been the same between the batters and the Oscars. I think that makes us enough of a predictor to be relevant, but not enough to be a carbon copy. And evenif not enough to be a carbon copy. And even if you leave the BAFTAs empty-handed, you will not leave empty-handed. After the ceremony, there is a 3 course meal for the guests, some of which have gone for the gluten-free option. And there are 250 umbrellas delivered on-site. Time for a check on the weekend weather. A bit uninspiring, a lot of cloud and foster around. We are looking of cloudy skies over the weekend. Less cold than it has been over the course of today. We had clear skies across the region, as you can see BCVOSS ti’IE VEgioVI, BS yOU CBVI SEE BCVOSS across the region, as you can see across the region. More cloud lurking across the zero will push across our patch -- lurking across the zero will push across our patch -- lurking across the North. Clear skies will mean temperatures drop fairly quickly tonight. We will see fast developing especially in ril areas. They should not be too much in the way of lies. Not bad to recent debt -- not be too much in the way of lies. Not bad to recent debt -- not too much in the way of life compared to recent days. After the frosty start tomorrow morning, not bad. Some sunny spells but then the cloud will filter in from the North. Turning skies grey by the afternoon. One more two spots of drizzly rain. But many of us will avoid those outbreaks showery rain. A little bit milder than recent days, but we have lost the sunshine and a biting wind. So it is this big area of high pressure that is bringing us a quieter and settled spell of weather. That will hang around over the course of the weekend and through next week. So not a lot of change. This is Saturday night into Sunday. A bit of drizzle but not as cold as recent nights. On Sunday, we start with a drizzly story but a bit brighter. Some sunshine breaking through by the afternoon. Temperatures possibly up to 9 degrees. Sadly milder than it has been. With the high pressure in charge, we see the new milder weather lasting throughout the weekend and into Monday. Temperatures up and the windy evening out. We will be losing the wintry weather. -- evening out. We will be losing the wintry weather. -- the wind easing out. The main headlines: Intense diplomatic efforts are under way in Moscow tonight to try to bring an end to the fighting in Ukraine. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French President, Francois Hollande, are holding crisis talks with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. A former children’s doctor, Michael Salmon, has been convicted of raping and sexually abusing girls at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire during the 1970s and ‘80s, at the same time jimmy Savile was abusing patients. A report by the Kings Fund says the government’s re-organisation of the NHS was ""misguided"" and cost billions of pounds that could have been spent on patient care. The cost of policing the Ecuadorian Embassy, where Wikileaks founder julian Assange has taken refuge, has now reached £10 million. The Deputy Mayor for Policing, Stephen Greenhalgh, says the huge cost of the operation is incredibly frustrating. More on the day’s stories on our website. And we’ll be back later during the ten o’clock news. So from us, have a lovely weekend. The Six Nations, the friendliest of rivalries... This is set to be a titanic tussle. An air of anticipation.

We are looking ahead to the Baftas with two men who know more than most about the movie business. One is a mega- successful movie mogul whose films have received over 300 Oscar nominations and 75 wins.

The territory possessions to six -- statistics show you that they had nearly 70% of the play in the Welsh art and in the end, England were emphatic winners. Great shot of Stuart Lancaster. They have been very composed in the whole game but that is a wonderful shot that they will keep a long time. I can’t tell you how big a win that is Ringland at the start of 2015. You have to say it is thoroughly deserved. Second half, they completely outplayed Wales. The forwards were fantastic and james Haskell was magnificent. He has come into the team and that is a huge win for England and I’m proud of all of them. Conversely for Wales? They were totally outplayed in the second half. They absolutely dominated the Welsh ball. England played all their rugby in the right areas. Nothing for Wales. rugby in the right areas. Nothing forWales. It is a big, big rugby in the right areas. Nothing for Wales. It is a big, big win for England and Wales have got to try to bounce back in a tough game. There’s no plan B as usual. Lets live from the man of the match, George Ford. What were the emotions as used it over that gig because it looked like it would win game? Ijust wanted to knock it over for the lads. The performance they put in, especially the pack was outstanding. It is the least I could do to try to kick that. Seems to be a different England in the second half. What was the message from the camp? We felt comfortable in the first half, we had a poor start but to come out and scored 13 points, the message at half-time was exactly the same as the message before the game. Carry on what we’re doing, build pressure and score some points. Well done to you today, you are the RBS man of the match, congratulations. Thank you. Outside him wasjonathanjoseph is called the drying was the difference in the. jerry? Backs all played well, Ford, joseph. Great footwork, leaving Dan Biggar stranded. From here, poortackling by George North and Rhys Webb. They should have nailed him. But his footwork, his speed and power, for such a small centre in modern-day rugby to slip out of that just shows you how elusive he is. Brilliant feat, one-on-one, rushing out of the line, standing him up, pushing him outside. Whether he scores or put the winger in, that is what it is all about, the winger in, that is what it is allabout, magicalfeat the winger in, that is what it is all about, magical feat to make something out of nothing, sometimes, players like that will win you the World Cup or the matches. In a World Cup year, that is the exact start England would have wanted. To be fair, England could have afforded to lose this game because they are going in the right direction. But to get the win and play so well away, you can’t overstate the importance of it. They have got to get the mindset going, match by match. They have got to put this before them -- behind them and their big-time cynically, keep on winning the other game and I’m delighted for them, and awesome performance. Throwing it forward, how much significance with that result have in the World Cup in September. Given that result? A big win for England and a big loss for Wales in the World Cup. Fight logically, England are ahead. We are on BBC Two Wales and on the red button in a fume and it, so switchover for that. We will reflect on what has been an extraordinary night, here. See you in a moment. SWING SOUEAKS No peace deal- crisis talks over Ukraine between European leaders and Russia end with no agreement. The German Chancellor and the French President met President Putin in the Kremlin to try to broker a ceasefire. A temporary truce in one town in Eastern Ukraine to allow out civilians but no sign the rebels will give up territory they’ve won. Rebels here have been building up the trappings of a state. They’ve got their own flags, their own border crossing and the police here are at work. They won’t want to give any of this up in the future. The three leaders have agreed to talk again by phone. We will look at what hope there can be for peace after the failure tonight of such high level diplomacy. Also tonight: Claims by Islamic State extremists that an American aid worker being held hostage has been killed. Billions of pounds wasted on a misguided re-organisation - independent health experts condemn the coalition’s changes to the NHS. Good feet byjoseph, excellent hands and feet. And first blood to England in the Six Nations Later on BBC London: £10million and rising, the cost to the capital of policing julian Assange. How a loophole in the law could see London getting more council-run schools. Good evening. Three of the most powerful leaders in the world sat in a room in crisis talks for five hours tonight but still couldn’t reach agreement on how to end the war in Eastern Ukraine. France’s President Hollande and Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel brought a peace plan to the Russian leader at a special meeting in the Kremlin. But hopes of an imminent deal to end that the war in Eastern Ukraine that’s claimed thousand of lives have been dashed in The three leaders have agreed to speak again by phone on Sunday. Our diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall’s report from Moscow contains flashing images. Besieged citizens of Debaltseve on Eastern Ukraine’s frontline. Trapped for weeks in a war zone and now, with a few precious possessions, a brief chance to get out. Today’s short humanitarian truce showed the warring sides can agree on something- a pause in the fighting to load the buses and let the convoy drive away. Meanwhile, in Moscow, a high-powered bid to get a more lasting settlement. It’s Angela Merkel’s first visit here since the Ukraine crisis began. Both she and the French President want to stop the bloodshed in Europe’s backyard. Inside the Kremlin, stiff formality when they met President Putin. Details of their offer are sketchy, except it will start with a ceasefire; then the trickier political deal. This is, by no means, the first attempt to try and end the bloodshed in Ukraine but the timing is interested. There is a lot at stake at the moment, notjust the escalation of fighting on the ground, but the economic pressure that Russia finds itself under from sanctions and low oil prices. And now this talk in the United States that if Russia is arming the rebels, maybe they should arm Ukraine. The US vice-president today didn’t directly address whether to give Ukraine weapons, but said something must be done. Ukraine is fighting for their very survival right now. Russia can not be allowed to redraw the map of Europe. And this is what so alarms the US and its Western partners, constant military activity right up to Ukraine’s border. This helicopter exercise yesterday included hitting precision targets in the southern Russian district abutting Ukraine. It’s also why the French and German leaders are so desperate to seal a peace deal to avoid Ukraine’s war turning into a clash between Russia and NATO. I think it’s really serious. I think this is the greatest threat to European security probably since the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and I don’t think President Hollande is far short of the mark when he says there is a risk of total war. This could escalate. Here in Moscow, though, plenty of people see this conflict the other way around. The volunteers collecting aid here for the separatists in East Ukraine believe it’s not Russia who is the aggressor, but the United States. TRANSLATION: This war is not between Ukraine and the rebels or even between Ukraine and Russia as a whole. It’s a war between Russia and the West. And Eastern Ukraine isjust the current frontline. That’s exactly what President Putin now claims, that Ukraine’s crisis is part of a bigger Western campaign to undermine and weaken Russia. If he really believes that, then peace may be hard to find. In recent weeks fighting has intensified in Eastern Ukraine. The conflict has claimed the lives of nearly 5,500 people since last April. And it’s estimated that around one and a half million people have fled their homes to escape the fighting. The rebels now control much of the Luhansk region and Donetsk - from where our World Affairs correspondent james Reynolds sent this report. The rebels of Donetsk have created their own police force. This afternoon, they invited us on patrol. These officers used to work for the Ukrainian police. They’ve now swapped sides and uniforms. Rebels here have been building up the trappings of a state. They’ve got their own flags, their own border crossings and police here are at work. And they won’t want to give any of this up in the future. Donetsk was founded by a Welsh engineer, john Hughes in the 19th century. It now exists in this half-worlds the rebels have renamed the Donetsk Peoples Republic. There may be a war going on but residents find ways of getting by. They still obey traffic lights, go shopping, and one wants a -- obey traffic lights, go shopping, and one wants a -- and one once a civil servant in Ukraine still travels on the number six bus. Ukraine is doing everything in order to push us away. Why should I feel part of the country that doesn’t want me? Many in the nearby rebel-held city feel the same way. They’ve been hit by recent fighting. TRANSLATION: This is only today, listen, you can hear it even now. They said there would be a ceasefire, but they are still shooting. There is no ceasefire. For some, there isjust a long wait. Truck drivers queue for more than a mile to cross from Government to rebel- held territory. mile to cross from Government to rebel-held territory. For rebel- held territory. For the rebels, a defined border crossing is proof that they’re heading towards their final goal, proof that they’re heading towards theirfinal goal, independence their final goal, independence from Kiev. Let’s talk to Bridget Kendall in Moscow. There had within -- been hopes with all the French and German and Russian leader in one room talking that there might be some kind of deal but those hopes appear to have been misplaced tonight? Well, that’s right. It hasn’t happened tonight. You might have thought with all those powerful leaders together perhaps there would be some breakthrough but there is also not a breakdown. Although the German Chancellor and the French President are probably on their way to the airport as I speak having been at these talks at the Kremlin, they are going to talk to President Putin on Sunday and what the Kremlin spokesman is saying is that there is an agreement to work on some kind of text which might, if it goes well, provide the basis of a joint document and that they could then take document and that they could then ta ke forward. take forward. It doesn’t sound as though they’ve given up hope entirely. It’s early days, we have heard fairly positive spin from the Kremlin. We need to hear a bit more from the French and German officials to get a sense of it. I would be surprised if they gave up after this just this one initial meeting. This is such a complex conflict which involves Kiev, as james was reporting there, the separatists and what their ambitions are, as well as Moscow, European partners and the United States. It’s going to take more than just one evening’s talks in the Kremlin to sort it out. Thank you. There are claims tonight from the extremist Islamic State that an American female hostage they were holding has been killed, reportedly during a coalition air strike in Syria. It’s claimed Kayla jean Mueller was killed in the city of Raqqa - an IS stronghold. The BBC cannot independently verify anything about the claims. From leaving college to when she was picked up by Islamic State in Syria, Kayla jean Mueller has devoted her time to helping others around the world. She lived and worked with humanitarian groups in northern India, Israel, and Palestine. Then she went to Syria. She was leaving a hospital run by in Aleppo when she was taken captive by Islamic State. They claimed she was the victim of a jordanian strike which hit this house, though no evidence has been offered to back the claim. It brought this sprons from -- this response from Barack Obama’s national security advisor. We are obviously concerned about the reports that have come in in recent hours. We do not at the present have any evidence to corroborate the claims. But obviously we will keep reviewing the information at hand. The White House is investigating these claims but there is good reason to give them a health warning. just asjordan reason to give them a health warning. just as jordan intensifies its actions following the brutal death of its pilot, how convenient for IS to be able to claim look what you have done, you have killed a female US citizen. And her the only victim, whaped to her bodyguards in the house? It may be that this is more propaganda than fact. The focus of recent days has been on these jordanianjets The focus of recent days has been on these jordanian jets taking the fight to Islamic stand state threw is also pressure on the US to make a commitment to tackling the streamists and in particular putting more assets on the ground to rescue those captured by them -- streamists. Secretary Kerry and our team are put ing every effort finding any Americans being held overseas, the Secretary has reached out to over four dozen countries. About Americans being held overseas, we are trying to bring these people home. This traumatic week has seen the King and Queen ofjordan become personally involved in the fight against IS. In ash zonia this weekend -- ash zonia this weekend an American mother waits of news of her daughter. A British Islamist extremist who went to Syria and then faked his own death in order to return home has beenjailed for 12 years. Imran Khawaja appeared in propaganda videos promoting Islamic State. He was arrested last year on his return to England and last month pleaded guilty to terror offences. Daniel Sandford reports. Imran Khawaja, he used to work in a London immigration detention centre. Two weeks ago, we got a flash - here it came back out. But he has now admitted travelling to Syria to train as a terrorist. This is a man associated with the Islamic State. Who glorified in the actions he was taking in Syria, through social media back to the UK, and encouraged others through social media tojoin him. Imran Khawaja has a low IQ, no educational qualifications and may not have fought in Syria but was close to the fighting and posed with heavy weapons and even the severed heads of Syrian soldiers. His family in West London have been in touch throughout. For months they begged him to come back: Book your ticket and get home or I will come and get you, his mother text him. His sister was worried about their parent’s health: I hate you for what you are putting them through. But he wrote back: I love it here. I will never return. He wanted to die a martyr. Then he agreed to come back. His group posted a emergency on Instagram, claiming he was dead to cover his tracks but the police did not fall for it, he was arrested at Dover. He is starting a 12-year prison term. Mrjustice Baker dismissed Imran Khawaja’s claim that he returned to Britain because of concern for his family and he had become disenchanted with the Islamic State. The judge concluded that he posed a significant risk to members of the public. To the family’s dismay, the judge jailed his cousin, Tahir Batti, for 21 months. Although he had gone to collect him, he had not told the police. Imran Khawaja, seen on the far left, will not be released for at least eight years. A former children’s doctor has been found guilty of raping and sexually abusing a number of young girls at the same hospital where jimmy Savile abused some of his victims. 80-year-old Michael Salmon worked as a consultant at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire during the 1970s and 80s. Duncan Kennedy’s report contains flash photography. Michael Salmon abused and raped his own child patients, often behind curtains, with their parents just a few feet away. Today, 30 years on, he faced justice. All these victims were children in the 1980s. They were children that put their trust in him, the parents put their trust in him. Michael Salmon abused his patients at the same time and same place thatjimmy Savile assaulted his victims, Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the 1980s. Salmon was not acting with Savile, but was arrested under Operation Yewtree, the police enquiry into Savile. In police interviews, Salmon revealed the contempt he had for his victims. I think they are gold diggers. Why do you think they are gold diggers? I can’t think of any other reason why they have done this, because what I have heard today is an absolute... I have to be careful what I say. A tissue of lies. Former staff at Stoke Mandeville who knew Salmon say they never suspected anything. I never knew of any of this behaviour. But at the time when I was told about it I was told it was about pornographic images on his computer in his outpatient clinic. And that was all I was aware of, up until it was after I left the hospital that I knew there was more to it than that. Tonight, Stoke Mandeville has responded to the Michael Salmon case. It said it took the matter seriously and has always cooperated with the police investigation. Michael Salmon was jailed for three years in 1990 for similar offences and was struck off. His victims will discover next week the sentence he will face for the crimes they suffered. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News. The Coalition Government’s reorganisation of the NHS in England was misguided and cost aliens of pounds that could instead have been spent on patient care, according to a damning report from a leading independent think tank, the King’s Fund. Downing Street said it did not accept the conclusions about the NHS. This report from Hugh Pym contains flash photography. It was a highly controversial set of reforms, one of the biggest shake-ups in the history of the NHS. Now, a respected think tank has branded this government’s changes as damaging and distracting, creating fractured leadership in the health service, resulting in billions of pounds being wasted. In the first three years the government focused too much on organisational change, creating a system that is not fit for purpose, which was distracting and meant that patient care took second place. Today, the Labour leader, latching on to those conclusions, pointed the finger at the Prime Minister. The responsibility goes directly to David Cameron’s door, and today he should personally apologise to the British people for having betrayed their trust, let them down and damaged our National Health Service. But Labour did not escape unscathed. The Kings Fund said the party was exaggerating when it claimed the NHS was being privatised. The reforms which took effect in England two years ago saw control of commissioning budgets given to GP groups, public health responsibilities moved to local government, and the abolition of Strategic Health Authorities. This Nottinghamshire GP heads one of the new commissioning groups funding health care for the local community. He says the reforms have helped patients. We have seen real changes, so locally, for example, we are now getting back to community-based teams built around patients and general practice that we lost years ago. So we have seen lots of really good improvement and we need to continue to develop that. That is what the NHS needs. Ministers were not available for interview but the former Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley, the main architect of the policy, said the number of doctors and nurses had risen and savings have far outweighed the cost of the reforms. These are difficult waters for the government and they have not directly engaged with the central conclusions of the report. But sources have noticed that the Kings Fund does welcome a shift away from managerial changes in the last couple years, to focus more on patient care and safety. The report will certainly fuel the heated political debate over the NHS. While ministers want to talk about current performance, Labour wants to highlight the government’s full record since 2010. Over now to the voters. Hugh Pym, BBC News. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. For the first time, a British security services tribunal has ruled against GCHQ for its secrecy in the way it shared intelligence with America. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal said until recently the agency had failed to comply with the law by not disclosing safeguards to protect the public. The court previously ruled the ways in which the agency carried out surveillance were legal. Nigel Farage abandoned a public appearance in Rotherham because of anti-UKIP protests outside his party’s local office. The UKIP leader was due to cut a ribbon at the office of election candidate jane Collins. Around Ao demonstrators had gathered, prompting police to advise Mr Farage to call off the event. The BBC has learned that the limit you can spend just by tapping your card on a reader, or contactless payments, will go up to £30 in December. The method is now so popular that £2.3 billion was spent that way last year. Hilary Mantel, the author Wolf Hall, has been made a Dame for her services to literature. Prince Charles admitted to her that he is a fan of the BBC television adaptation. It recently emerged that the Prince’s household is nicknamed Wolf Hall by his staff as a joke, in reference to the ""treacherous and opportunistic world"" depicted by the writer. The low-cost retailer Poundland has always had an eye for a bargain. Now, it’s buying up its high street rival, the 99p chain of stores. The deal’s worth £55 million and would add 250 stores to Poundland’s network of shops. The recession was a big factor behind Poundland’s rise. Emma Simpson explains its continued popularity. At Poundland, you don’t need to ask the price. Cheap, with no frills, but it’s big business. From sweets to socks, Poundland offers an eclectic mix of products for sure. Its stores thrived during the recession and it continues to attract customers, including the more affluent shopper. We love the idea, it seems, of a bargain. I have got dish soap, which is usually a good deal, and the Tupperware clip on lids, which are two for one is pretty good. And I’m going to get some peanuts. I have actually come in to get candles, some baked beans, some window cleaner. And yes, I’m going out with an awful lot more. You go round the shop and you think, I could do with one of them. You come in to spend a couple pound and you go back out spending quite a few pounds. Poundland is on a spending spree as well. It hopes to buy its smaller rival, 99p Stores, a deal which would help it expand in the south. Infact, the whole discount market is on a roll. They are not all national household names but they are opening stores and piling on sales. Welcome to the fastest-growing section of our high streets. When the recession first hit, shoppers started exploring these retailers out of necessity. Many of them liked what they found and they are shopping there out of preference, notjust because they have too. I think still a lot of shoppers are on quite a tight budget. You walk into Poundland with a £20 note and you know what you can buy. It is easy to understand. It is cheerio to the 99p Stores though, if this deal gets approved. They will eventually be rebranded Poundland, a retailer that is fast becoming one of the biggest players on the high street. Emma Simpson, BBC News. Rugby, and the Six Nations kicked off this evening with England up against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The hosts had a storming start but the visitors got themselves back in the game. Our Sports Editor, Dan Roan, is there. Yes, a famous victory for Stuart Lancaster’s side. England came into the match with an injury crisis. The Welsh were very much the favourites. And they showed why in the first few minutes, scoring first in an explosive start and at one point they enjoyed a ten point advantage. Then the momentum shifted. England scored a try through Anthony Watson to make it more of a contest, and thenjonathanjoseph to make it more of a contest, and then jonathan joseph wriggled free, Welsh defence to give England a real chance with what proved the decisive try. George Ford, who ended up being man of the match, scored several points with the boot as well, and ultimately England were worthy winners by 21-16. They will be delighted with that. It is a huge confidence booster for the World Cup hosts. It may be seven months away, but this felt quite the build-up had begun for rugby’s showpiece event. Two years ago, remember, England came here and were thrashed by 27 points by Wales. Given their injuries, many thought they might be on the receiving end of a similar result. So to come here, to play so well and to hang on to victory will give them much confidence going into their next few matches in the six Nations and, of course, looking ahead to the World Cup when they will play Wales in September in the ",,
21,BBC1 London,4-feb-2015,BBC London News,13:40,5 mins,True,"but not without a fight. One of those opposed is the Canary Wharf group, who are threatening to take legal action over the decision and the way it was carried out. Our political editor Tim Donovan is at City Hall. So not completely straightforward then, Tim? The most contention involves the East-West superhighway, and one section in particular has caused concern, going from Tower Hill to Westminster. The concerns of organisations like Canary Wharf and cab drivers and the Corporation of London have intervened in the past has been that this is going to have too much of a harmful effect on traffic coming into London. One of the things transport for London has done to try to mitigate that concern is to reinstate a lane of traffic, so it will still be two lanes of traffic coming into town, although it is one lane at the moment going out of town, to accommodate this new superhighway. Canary Wharf, inspired of these improvements, say that they still oppose what is being done here. They are considering legal action, they say there has not been a thorough enough consultation, that normal procedures, the way this was discussed through the board at transport for London, was not normal. One of the key officials, Peter Anderson, normal. One of the key officials, PeterAnderson, is Peter Anderson, is on the board of transport for London. That gives you a kind of idea about some of the concerns, close to home, and the mayor appoints this board. It did support the mayor. Overall, there was dissent from Peter Anderson and concern from the taxi driver representation, there was concern from Sirjohn Arnott, head of the Olympic delivery authority, he said there were issues about policy which favoured a minority, that could actually hit motorists and so on. In the end, the mayor was a very important thing, sending a message not only in terms of safety, health, participation, cycling, but you could put difficult measures like this infrastructure measures in place. There would be difficulty to begin with but in three or four-year is we would be looking back and wondering what the fuss was about. -- but in three orfour years. The conservative MP for Harrow East faces repaying more than a thousand pounds in wrongly claimed expenses. An investigation has found that Bob Blackman submitted more than 700 inaccurate mileage expenses and in almost every instance the claims were greater than the distance travelled. More devolution and greater mayoral powers will be crucial if London’s transport is to cope with population growth, according to a former Government advisor. The number ofjourneys by Londoners are expected to increase by a fifth to 30 million a day over the next fifteen years. Professor David Begg says that despite schemes like Crossrail, more funding will be needed. More autonomy forfuture More autonomy for future mayors, and causing much more autonomy over tax-raising powers, stamp duty, etc, London is a waste going to find it difficult to invest at the level thatit difficult to invest at the level that it needs to, to cater for this population growth. -- The problem is unless we have more autonomy for future mayors, and causing much more autonomy over tax-raising powers, stamp duty, etc, London is a waste going to find it difficult to invest at the level that it needs to, to cater for this population growth. Right lets get a check on the weather with Kate Kinsella. We have one or two sunny spells out there, it should stay dry, but the temperature is not really having any impression on the sunshine, four or 5 degrees. It is going to feel very bitter by the end of the day, overnight we will see showers, they could be wintry, later on in the night especially, and over higher ground as the temperature drops, one or two snow flurries, but predominantly for most of us, should stay dry.

It will feel very bitter, temperature, 5 degrees, it will probably feel a lot more cold. That wind will stay with us through to Friday as well. The next Met Office yellow weather warning comes into play at midnight tomorrow and it is for snow and ice. Cold temperatures will continue, will feel much colder, because of the north-easterly breeze. We will be back with a programme at 6:30pm, you can keep up-to-date on the website and on the radio.

22,BBC News 24,4-feb-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"Not fit for purpose, the entire cabinet at Rotherham council resigns over the handling of a child sex abuse scandal. A damning report found vulnerable children weren’t being protected by a council rife with ""bullying, sexism and suppression"". The crimes committed are so appalling. The council’s remedy is so utterly inadequate, the government cannot in good conscience turn a blind eye. It comes as a judge from New Zealand is named as the new chair of an independent inquiry into historical child abuse. Also on the programme tonight: Fury after the murder of a jordanian pilot. The country’s King promises a relentless war against Islamic State. At least 25 people die as a plane in Taiwan crashes into a river shortly after takeoff. Half of all people in Britain will develop cancer at some point because of longer lives and changing lifestyles. Coming up in sport,. Good evening and welcome to the BBC’s News at Six. A criminal investigation is to be launched after a highly critical report found that Rotherham Council was ‘not fit for purpose’ over the way it handled child sexual exploitation cases. The entire cabinet has resigned after the report said they were still failing to protect vulnerable children from harm and that there was a culture of bullying, sexism and suppression at the council. An investigation last year found that more than 14 hundred children have been subjected to abuse in the South Yorkshire town over 16 years. Our Social Affairs Correspondent, Alison Holt, reports. Lying at the heart of the south Yorkshire town of Rutherham, a council where, according to today’s report, there is a culture of covering up uncomfortable truths and failing to protect those who are vulnerable. You could tell by my appearance. I went to five and a half stone and different coloured hair. I wasn’t going to school, I wasn’t going home. There is no way they couldn’t have realised that something was wrong. Again and again, this girl’s voice and the voices of other children being sexually exploited in the town were ignored. A continuing failure to act, which this report blames on a council not fit for purpose. A culture of bullying and denial. I think, over a long period of time really, the council has not really listened to inspections, to reports to people trying to get them to improve what they are doing. The Council’s former leader, Roger Stone, refused to be interviewed by the inquiry team. He is described in the team as being a bully. The former deputy leader is said to have been liked by some but feared by others. Neither wanted to comment today. This afternoon, the Community Secretary announced that he was putting in his own commissioners to run the council. It would only be justified in the most exceptional case. Rotherham is, I believe, such a case. A truly rare case where the children of Rotherham have been so badly let down by those elected to serve them. They were abducted, beaten and intimidated. It was the jay Report last August that found that more than 1400 children had been sexually exploited in the town over 16 years. With many of the perpetrators said to be of Pakistani heritage. Even this independent report is said to have been disputed by many of the councillors. Dammit whether it is one victim or 1400 or more victims, what she says stands and while people continue to deny it, it makes their own situation worse. It is an insult to the victims. This young woman believes that the problems are so deep-rooted the change would be easy. She was 14 when she was first exploited. Someone from social services ignored me. There were various meetings about me. They were saying that if there is anybody found to be dead it would be me. For her, nothing has changed. There is no support, there is nothing in place to basically show people that they have got support. In a short statement this afternoon, Rotherham Council said that given the lack of council in its political leadership the whole Cabinet was resigning. That will happen when they know when the new commissioners will be taking over. Not all of the information gathered by the team has been published today. They examined over 7000 documents. We have been told that files relating to one former councillor and want existing council have been passed to the National crime agency. The Home Secretary has also been informed. In a statement, the National crime agency has said thatit the National crime agency has said that it has been asked to examine a number of potentially criminal matters uncovered during the inspection. It says, it will not go into further detail at the moment, but that will be part of the ongoing operation investigation here. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has named a judge from New Zealand as the new chair of the independent inquiry into historical child sex abuse in England and Wales. justice Lowell Goddard is the third person to be appointed to the role after two previous nominees stepped down over perceived conflicts of interest. Our Home Affairs Correspondent, Tom Symonds, reports. Could it be third time lucky? German number one, Baroness Elizabeth Butler Sloss number one, Baroness Elizabeth Butler Sloss resigned because brother is to be the government’s used to be the government chief lawyer. The second left because she dined with one subject of the enquiry. The government searched the world for somebody with no links to the enquiry. She will bring a wealth of expertise to the role and will be as removed as possible from the organisations and institutions that might become the focus of the enquiry. She sits in New Zealand’s High Court. She has led an enquiry into police handling of child abuse cases. She has been criticised for a ruling which defended a paedophile boss greater privacy, but two other court agreed with her. Today, emerging from a meeting with the Home Secretary, survivors of child abuse give their support. I have every confidence that this would be an excellent appointment. It is widely welcomed by the people at the heart of this enquiry, which are survivors of child abuse. This, 25 years ago, is one of them. I would come home and there would be people there waiting for me. I would be taken somewhere else. I met men that I had been told to make Abbey. Becky, not her real name, felt hope an enquiry was announced. When it descended into chaos and arguments, like many, she was left confused and upset. The question is, candidature trust be restored? Are survivors, as a group, we find it very hard to trust whatever form the enquiry takes. There will be a section of people that cannot trust for their own reasons, because of their own stories. The government today decided against a Royal commission on child abuse, like the one under way in Australia, but it has beefed UP way in Australia, but it has beefed up the enquiry’s powers. It will now be a statutory enquiry. What does that mean? Lie will guard will have the power to look at restricted documents, for example, and call witnesses whether they like it or not. They will give evidence under oath. That means he will need lawyers. The enquiry will be bigger and more expensive. The enquiry will cover decades of abuse and the response to it in schools, children’s homes and other institutions. It could take five years to complete and it is likely to delve into the heart of power itself. Labour has defended its record on business after David Cameron branded the party anti-enterprise and anti-business in the Commons today. Mr Cameron mocked the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls for forgetting, during a TV interview, the full name of a businessman who backed the party. It comes as the Archbishop of Canterbury has spoken out about tax avoidance in an exclusive interview with our Business Editor, Kamal Ahmed. Politicians often like to be highly visible when chatting to business. Theyjudge the public like parties on the side of wealth and job creators. The two major parties are not at war over who is best for business. The issue at the headlines when the head of one of the UK’s biggest retailers, retailers, boots, suggested a Labour victory at the next general election would be a catastrophe. Last night, Ed balls, the Shadow Chancellor, had something of a memory malfunctioned when he failed to remember the name of one of Labour’s business backers. The, former Chief Executive of EDS, who I was talking to a few moments ago. He is a big supporter of ours. What is his name? It has gone from my head. Today at Prime Minister questions, David Cameron turned the knife. The day after his Shadow Chancellor was askedif day after his Shadow Chancellor was asked if he could think of one single business leader, and you’ll be said? , Gino Woody said Mr Speaker? He said Bill, somebody. Bill somebody, is not a person, Bill somebody is Labour’s policy. Ed Miliband back on the business issue. He said the Conservatives were more interested in who he described as tax avoidance. I will tell what people on the site are doing. We are standing upfor people on the site are doing. We are standing up for hard-working families and businesses while he is a friend of the Bill somebody be premised was referring to was Bill Thomas, a former neighbour advisor. Ed Miliband has a compelling vision for what kind of country he wants to lead as prime minister. That kind of country will look after the weakest people in society as well as the strongest people in society. Some businesses are nervous about the election and worry about policies associated with both parties. The president of the business group the CBI said that company leaders had every right to speak out. I think it is absolutely fair that these people, these companies, should have a right to speak out on things of concern, whether it is the European Union, immigration or whether it is about policies that might hurt investment. The issue does notjust involve politicians and businesses, other powerful voices have also spoken out. With the battle raging over the role of business and society and politicians trading blows over whether they are a pro or anti business, I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury, fear at Lambeth Palace. I asked what role should companies play in greeting a just society. The archbishop told me that he supported wealth creators, but all businesses should pay a fair rate of tax. There is always been the principle that you pay tax-free earned money. If you earn the money any particular country, the revenue service of that country needs to get a fair share of what you have earned. What we have seen today is how the two major parties are going to approach the election. The Conservatives will say they are the friend of business and economic growth, liberal counter that the Tories are in bed with tax avoidance and that they are the backers of a fair economy. The head of the official inquiry into the Iraq War, Sirjohn Chilcot, has rejected calls to set a timetable for publication, saying he does not want to ""arouse false hopes"". Sirjohn told MPs he’d ""under-estimated"" the time it would take to study up to 150,000 documents. He also said the process of giving key figures the right to respond to criticism was holding up the process. Sirjohn insisted he wouldn’t be rushed. The risk of arousing had a false hopes or false expectations, either way, old ways, for me, meeting the powerful appetite there is for all sorts of, often good reasons, for people to know when the report is likely to become available. An NHS doctor has been cleared of performing female genital mutilation in the first British case of its kind. His co-defendant was also found not guilty of encouraging the offence. The jury took less than half an hour to reach their verdicts. Here’sjune Kelly. How do you feel about the verdict? He is the up and coming young doctor who became a criminal suspect. Today it took the jury less than half an hour to clear Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena of subjecting one of his patients to female genital relation. F GM as it is known is practised in some commuters from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. It leads to major physical problems for those forced to endure it. Especially when they give birth. The woman at the centre of this case had her first child at the Whittington Hospital in North London. She had undergone FGM when she wasjust six. Her identity is being protected and she is known only as a bee. As the gynaecologist, person to said he had a reverse the damage that had been done to her so that he could deliver her baby. Afterwards, he carried out a procedure on her and that the prosecution said was the same as the original FGM she had undergone. The doctor said that he did not understand Hebrew blog. Person to said he had not received any training in dealing with FGM and it was the first time he treated a patient who had undergone. Afterwards the trust wants investigation. They then went to the police. One FGM campaigner believes thatitis police. One FGM campaigner believes that it is right that this case was tested in the courts. Nobody is above the lot. You cannot necessarily say that you cannot prosecute people who might have committed SGM were people suspected of killing FGM. I think it is a Every year the young girls are taken abroad and forced to undergo FGM, as in this ceremony. It was wrong to put the doctor in the dock according to one medical specialist. I think there was a lot of pressure to bring about a successful prosecution for FGM and they were looking around to see if they could find one. But this was not the right one to bring about. He now faces an investigation by the General Medical Council. Our top story this evening: A criminal investigation is to be launched after a highly critical report found that Rotherham Council was not fit for purpose over the way it handled child sexual exploitation cases.

This is the moment in Taiwan when a passenger plane, carrying almost 60 people, clipped a bridge shortly after takeoff before crashing into a river. The footage was captured by passing motorists. At least 25 people were killed. Many more are missing. But miraculously, 15 people were pulled out alive. john Sudworth’s report contains flash photography.

The plane finally came to rest upside down and broken in a shallow river. Rescue workers pulled some passengers to safety, a total of 15 survived the crash including a 2 -year-old boy. The work is continuing late into the night, they have brought heavy lifting gear and as you can see, a large part of the plane has been brought out onto the river bank. There are still some submerged sections were bodies could be trapped but after so long in the water, this is no longer a rescue mission but a recovery operation. Shortly after the crash, the chief executive of TransAsia Airways piled in the polity at a press conference.

The King ofjordan has promised a relentless war against Islamic State, after they murdered a jordanian air force pilot. King Abdullah said the war would be waged on Islamic State’s ground. jordan reacted swiftly to the pilot’s death - executing two convicted jihadists, including a failed female suicide bomber, overnight. Our Defence Correspondent, PaulAdams, reports. A dorm convoy, the only sign that jordan was already taking revenge. The bodies of two Al-Qaeda prisoners long since sentenced to death now returning from the gallows. After yesterday’s horror, the public would settle for nothing less. Later on the road from the airport, Moore is the blaze -- the road from the airport, Moore is the blaze -- displays of solidarity as King Abdullah returned from Washington. This small country rallied together at a time of wounded pride. jordan says it is fighting back, the King, meeting security officials, spoke of a relentless war, the Government says it is increasing the country’s politician -- it is increasing the country’s politician -- in the state, but how far? Everyone is talking about helping the Iraqi military, the Syrian moderate opposition and troops in order to fight on the ground. Farfrom troops in order to fight on the ground. Far from the capital in the hills above the dead Sea, the very public rituals of condolence. The pilot’s extended family gathered in his home village to pray, to think, to grieve together. The tribal headquarters are being renamed, the whole of the marker. His father will spend days in the tent and he will meet many well-wishers but also hear a number of questions, how can jordan push -- a number of questions, how can jordan push -- punished those responsible and what should the country’s be in the coalition against IS? He questioned jordan ‘s role in the fight, not any more. TRANSLATION: I am certain that jordan must fight them inside their hideouts. They are coming for us, we must fight them before they reach us.

Many more people in the UK will get cancer at some point in their lives, according to a new study by Cancer Research UK. They say one in two of us will be diagnosed with the disease, partly because we’re living longer but also because of changes to our lifestyles. However, cancer survival rates are improving, which means that around one in four people will actually die from it. Our Medical Correspondent, Fergus Walsh reports. Cancer touches every family in the UK. This woman, who is 69, has had a form of skin cancer twice in the last 15 years but was successfully treated both times. I think you just have to face it, there is no point in being terrified, is a fact life. A lot of people are going to get cancer, especially in old age. Often it won’t be a death sentence for a lot of people, they will get treatment and they will live with that. So what are the reasons behind the increase, wealthy older we get the more likely we are to get cancer so it is no surprise that most of the increase in cases is due to us living longer, average life expectancy has been soaring puny 83 for women and 79 for men. Back in 1980, the lifetime risk of getting cancer was one in four, by 1990 it was one in three, now it is one into. Cancer is not always inevitable, part of the rise is due to lifestyle. Cancer Research UK thinks that four in ten cancers are avoidable if we live more healthily. We need this stop smoking, moderate alcohol intake, exercise, healthy diet. Forthose alcohol intake, exercise, healthy diet. For those who have cancer, we need to treat it earlier because we know it is much easier to treat successfully then. A huge increase in cases, combined with expensive new treatments, mean that the costs of cancer care will continue to soar but with half of patients surviving at least a decade, living with cancer will increasingly become the norm. The Aljazeera journalist, Peter Greste, who’s been freed after more than a year in an Egyptian prison, has arrived back in Australia. He was reunited with his parents at Brisbane Airport- something he said he had dreamt about every day during his detention. He said he was ecstatic to be home but renewed a call for Egypt to free his two colleagues who are still injail. Nearly 75,000 rugby union fans will pack into the Millennium Stadium on Friday night to see England face Wales in the curtain raiser of this year’s Six Nations. It will mark the start of a career-defining year for England coach Stuart Lancaster- the former PE teacher who is now entrusted with leading his team into a home World Cup. He believes it’s the biggest year ever for the sport in the UK. Our Sports Editor, Dan Roan, has been to meet him. Westpark Under-14s in Leeds are a typical grassroots rugby team except for one thing - their assistant coach just happens to be the England manager. just get the ball moving, don’t kick all the time, let’s keep playing rugby, yeah? Stuart Lancaster’s son, Daniel, plays here and his famous dad can’t resist prowling the touchline every time he has a free weekend. Go low! Pull him out, Ben! We’ve got a good defensive line organised, we need some energy to get them across the line. Here in the team’s clubhouse, Lancaster told me he wouldn’t have it any other way. I love doing it. I definitely don’t see it as extra work. They think, oh my God, the England coach is there. They are keen to chat, have photos and everything else. You realise the impact of a successful England team OI’] gI’3SSI’00tS I’Ugby. And the importance of the connection between the England team and grassroots rugby. It was back to the dayjob this afternoon, Lancaster preparing his injury-hit squad for England’s Six Nations match on Friday against Wales. A team they play at the World Cup in September. So how is he dealing with the pressure? It’s lying awake at night, thinking, feeling the sense of responsibility, wanting to do the bestjob you can. The Wales game is a big game because we play them in our pool. Selection consumes every minute of my day and when I wake up in the morning, it’s the first thing I think about, and so it should be. England were humiliated by a rampant Wales two years ago, and Lancaster admits they may still be lacking in the experience needed for a World Cup. I think in terms of the evolution of the team and the age of the team, it would be nice to have a little more time. Experience is probably a little bit under where we would like to be. Here at their training camp, Lancaster and his players know that a World Cup on home soil means massive expectation but also opportunities for both the team and the sport. The biggest sporting event in the world is sat on our back door and it’s coming round the corner. It’s notjust a two-week event, it is a seven-week event. So I think the World Cup in this country will be huge and it’s certainly the biggest year for rugby we will know. Back at Westpark Rugby Club, they may not see quite as much of Lancaster this year but he believes his grounded approach will stand him in good stead as the pressure intensifies. Now let’s get a look at the weather with jay Wynn. It is turning Frosty once again overnight. Further north in Scotland, there is a bit of snow working its way south but we have a peppering of wintry showers for the East of England. Let’s focus on those because they will keep going through the night. There will be a dusting of snow in places, across the moors there will be a dusting. There will be a cold wind coming down from the North. Further north, a quiet start for the day. Chilly, also in Northern Ireland, a lot of cloud around. We have already seen those wintry showers but it is in the western side of England and Wales where we will see the clearest skies. A slow start to the day, at nine in the morning it is still around freezing in Cardiff. The western side will turn a bit more cloudy through the afternoon as the rain drifts from east to west. For Norwich and London that will brighten up in the afternoon but if you wintry showers for Kent. Five or six Celsius. Even colder in the South on Wednesday because there is a -- Thursday.

The wind chill factor will be quite large, it will feel bitterly cold. Four or five Celsius but the wind will make it feel not so cold. The weekend, a lot of dry weather, the winds eased down and it should feel less cold. That is it for us. Hello. This is BBC News. The headlines at just after 6.30pm.

And we speak to actress Cathy Tyson, about herjourney In the week the capital’s population reaches an all-time high, how will Londoners be kept on the move? And we speak to actress Cathy Tyson, about herjourney from Mona Lisa to Marie Curie. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. Good evening. The true extent of homelessness in London is much worse than we think. That’s the claim from two charities which argues official figures have not reflected a big rise in people who have nowhere to live. The charity, ""Crisis"", and The joseph Rowntree Foundation say their research shows government welfare reforms are driving up the number of homeless. Ministers today denied their policies were to blame and said the report was misleading. Nick Beake has the story. ~ I have never been more sure. They may have only met a few weeks ago but these two men said the friendship they have forged while sleeping rough will last a lifetime. This doorway on Oxford Street became home for them just before Christmas. He was evicted after falling into arrears and finds his local council would not help him because he wasn’t a priority case. You expect help from your local borough. A little bit of help. When I was put in a hostel, -- borough. A little bit of help. When I was put in a hostel, -- whether I was put in a hostel, Ijust wanted a room. Somebody work out where I was going to go. I was left out in the street. To charities claim today that Carlos is among those who may not be recorded in official homelessness figures. Crisis and the joseph Rowntree Foundation point to government data that showed Londoners in 17,000 households were at risk of losing their home last year. However, the charities estimate that more than 50,000 people in the capital had nowhere to live or faced eviction. That is a 12% rise on the previous year. The impact of benefit sanctions and the impact of benefit cuts is still having a desperate toll on people’s lives. They are approaching the local authorities because they are homeless or in fear of being homeless. Local authorities themselves are having their own budget cuts and are having to reduce local homelessness services. That combination of factors is still making things worse. Ministers have hit back, saying their welfare reform is not to blame. They say the charities figures are misleading because, for example, they include people who counsels have helped to find a home. The government says it has given more than 500,000 -- The government says it has given more than 500,000 -- money to bungee groups. London councils say it has not been enough for a growing problem. The population is growing and we had only this week that it is higher now thanit only this week that it is higher now than it has ever been. Those pressures has to be meant within a smaller and smaller budget. Back on Oxford Street, this remains home. But Carlos hasjust found some artist Dave. However, it is in the Midlands. After 20 years in London, his future is not in this city. -- he has found somewhere to stay. Coming up, the Mayor’s plans to introduce a new urban cycle route are big -- introduce a new urban cycle route are big-- approved but not introduce a new urban cycle route are big -- approved but not without opposition. A London MP has asked for increased security for members of the jewish community following the terrorist attacks in France. Four weeks on, and both the jewish and Muslim communities have been reporting heightened tensions closer to home in London. The Metropolitan Police says it’s increasing its presence and won’t tolerate race hate crimes of any kind. This report from Sarah Harris. Security at the Elstree and Borehamwood Synagogue in Hertfordshire has never been tighter since the murders in Paris one month ago. The threat of anti-Semitism isn’t just felt from the other side of the Channel, though. 15 miles across London, the police are investigating what is being called an anti-jewification march, which is being planned for next month. Locks have been installed here on buildings to reassure. It’s very concerning. Disturbing, actually. Anti-Semitism in any form is abhorrent, but this is a wider issue which needs to be tackled and grappled with by the authorities. As a jewish community, we should also have our voices heard that this is unacceptable. In the Commons, today, the MP for Finchley has asked for more support from the government and the police to protect members of the jewish community. There are 120 community buildings now at risk of terrorist attacks of the type we saw in Paris. Will my Right Honourable Friend commit to looking at creating a counterterrorism fund to help meet the security measures of these community buildings? The attack on the jewish community centre in the South of France yesterday compounded anxieties in London, so soon after the horrors in Paris. The government is looking into providing extra protection on top of the £23 million security grant forjewish schools. The Metropolitan Police says it is already providing extra support. What we are doing is reaching out through our networks, through to jewish communities, to make sure that they know we are in their areas, that they know that we are present around schools and, most importantly, if there is any instance or any crime related to religion or faith, that they call us immediately and we will take proper and effective action. The fear doesn’t just apply to the jewish community. This member of a Muslim women’s support network says world events have led to one of its members being abused in a London supermarket. Luckily, passers-by came to her rescue. The initial reaction was of anger and upset. What she said was, why should she have to suffer as a result of what IS is doing? Some leaders are advising caution, not fear, in people’s reactions to campaigns of hate. But there is no doubt that one month on from the Paris murders, the impact of extremism is still being felt in communities across London. An investigation by the Parliamentary Watchdog than the Bob Blackman submitted in accurate mileage expenses. Mr Blackburn is saying he will appeal the decision. Yes, he is furious about this. He was warned over his expenses back in 2011, but when compliance officers recently looked into them, they compared his diaries and his mileage claims with the actual distances he appeared to have travelled on Google maps. What they found was that in all but four cases, he appears to have overestimated his mileage. They flagged up one particular claim. When Mr Blackburn heard it said that he had taken a 51+ mile round trip to the new Tottenham Hotspur training ground, the mapping tool set that was just a 33 mile trip. ground, the mapping tool set that wasjust a 33 mile trip. He was just a 33 mile trip. He said today that that was an error. He said the others can be justified because sometimes he took the quickest route, not The position is that there are traffic hotspots, congestion, roads that are closed routinely for roadworks and suchlike. I use the most predictable route than I can possibly take to get me to locations within the constituency. That’s not the most direct route, that is the route that is the most predictable. I have justified those in the evidence I have submitted. The difficulty for Bob Blackman is that voters in the upcoming election may not understand the detail of this. They may simply see him as another politician appearing to have fiddled his expenses. That will not go down well in Harrow East. That is one of the reasons people there got rid of their last MP, he was caught UP rid of their last MP, he was caught up in the previous expenses scandal. -- who was caught up. Labour are very much eyeing this seat up again. They’re hoping to regain it and they only need a 3.5% swing in their favour. I gather there is news from a senior Labour figure on the party’s next Mayor candidate? Yes, Margaret Hodge has ruled herself out. She says she wants to see a non-white person win that role, someone who represents London’s diversity. She has not thrown the full weight of her support behind herfriend, Dame Tessa jowell, someone that many think is a frontrunner. Thank you. The Mayor’s plans to introduce what will be the longest urban cycle route in Europe have been approved by the board of Transport for London. But it’s not been plain sailing- one of those opposed is the Canary Wharf Group - who is threatening to take legal action over the decision and the way it was carried out. Our political editor Tim Donovan reports. We have been listening to concerns, London’s transport bosses said today. The East and West segregated cycle route would now not mean other traffic reduced to one main, westbound into central London. It would be back to two, significantly cutting potential delays. They would also be -- cutting potential delays. They would also be -- there would be junction improvements, better traffic lights and improvements, better traffic lights and a blitz on illegal parking. Canary Wharf welcome the improvements but wonder about the eastbound carriageway. That will still be down to one lane road traffic. They think there has not been enough consultation, nora They think there has not been enough consultation, nor a detailed assessment of how more cyclists along here will displace traffic problems to other roads near this route. This superhighway would run from West London through Hyde Park, along embankment to Tower Hill. Official data suggests that the east to West cycle superhighway could cost London’s economy tens of millions pounds. The concern for board member Sirjohn Arnott, the man who oversaw the creation of the Olympic facilities. This does not, to a large extent, work. The chat was cordial but the Canary Wharf directory sitting on the TEFL board does not like what the Mayor is doing. There has been a threat of legal action. -- There has been a threat of legal action. -- the Transport for London board. He would not say either way. A spokesman was cautious. That is a decision we have to take. Why can you not tell us now? We will have to go back and look at what’s Transport for London are saying, which is that they will review the scheme as it is implement it. Let’s look at the detail of what that is. We are sure that boosting cycling and making it safer is the right way to go forward. It will be a cleaner and greener city. This scheme has overwhelming public support. Cyclists love the idea and the Mayor is confident that it will come eventually to be seen as hugely beneficial. A Londoner has become the first man in Britain to walk with the help of a bionic leg brace. john Simpson headed to the golf course this morning to demonstrate just how the technology works. But as with so many cutting edge inventions, it doesn’t come cheap. Emma North went to meet him. john Simpson is learning to walk again and one of the first places he is heading is the golf course. If you haven’t got those, I’ll be upset. He had barely got to walk the first time when he contracted polio. He has had to wear callipers most of his life. They have been heavy, painful and slow, and when they broke, they broke his leg. My first impression ofjohn was that he had the heart of a lion and the will to progress and do things that most other people wouldn’t even entertain. This is what has given him the new start. It’s a new combination of Bluetooth and brilliant German engineering. It’s called a C-brace. Here we have the brains of the system, the electronics, with a battery and the hydraulic system within, which communicates with this carbon fibre spring, which tells it every 0.2 of a second what position it in at any given time, so it knows how to operate. Before you do. Correct. I’m enjoying every minute because I’m having to learn a lot, but the benefit is that I’m walking pretty normally now. I have to trust it and, believe me, I do now. It’s monitoring exactly what I’m doing. But technology like this costs between ÂlIo-£60,000. It is exceptionally expensive. I would say it is not within the NHS’s budget to be able to have an influx of requests for these types of devices, especially when they run into five figures. john believes the C-brace will not only help patient mobility but ease the side-effects of wearing callipers. In the long run, it could save the NHS money. The second 24 hour strike by London’s 27,000 bus workers starts at midnight tonight. Union members want the 18 different companies which run the capital’s bus services to give all drivers the same pay. Transport for London says that could cost up to £100 million a year. Alice Bhandhukravi joins us from Vauxhall with more details. It isa It is a complex dispute over driver’s pay and tomorrow is the first of three planned 24-hour strikes, planned for this month. Expect disruption from around for a through until Friday morning. The strike will see members from 18 different bus operating companies walking out. If it has the same level of disruption as the last bus strike, it could affect as many as 630 out of 670 routes across London. Unlike on the tube, drivers on buses work for 18 different operators. They don’t all in the same amount. Unions say that is unfair. The problem we have got is that we have a 2 tier workforce in which people coming into the industry in recent years never gets to the top of pay. We have got hundreds of rates of pay. People are driving the same buses on the same routes, with the same company, on different rates of pay. This has to stop. Unions want Transport for London to harmonise those rates of pay across all 18 bus operating companies. CFL say it is not their response ability. The only people who can make this better are the employees, talking to the employers. -- better are the employees, talking to the employers. -- Transport for London. It is not for us to step in and make big changes. The last 20 years, we have run a brilliant service in this city. Local pay negotiation between drivers and their employers -- negotiation between drivers and their employers -- as a result of local negotiation. The advice, as always, is to check before you travel.

Next, continuing our series, 'Crowded Capital’, and the pressure on London because of its record population - which is still rising. Tonight: we focus attention on how our transport system will cope with hundreds of thousands more passengers over the next two decades? Here’s our Transport Correspondent, Tom Edwards on the options being considered. London and its success has always been linked to transport. The city -- as the city has grown, so have the transport links. Transport for London will have to continue to innovate, much in the way that you can see in the London transport Museum. New applications of technologies, new types of systems, new services. By 2030, the number of daily trips across the capital is expected to rise by 5 million. It is expected to increase to 30 million trips per day. Some schemes are already being built and will add capacity, but more plants are needed. We need to complete -- more plants are needed. We need to complete -- completely overhaul the tube. We need to roll out the success of that on to other lines. Crossrail to is ourfocus out the success of that on to other lines. Crossrail to is our focus at the moment in terms of additional capacity. The coroner is from Southend West London. Congestion in central London will increase by 20%. All the proposals for new roads, new railways, will require a great deal of money. No one has a consistent story to tell about that where -- where that money is coming from. You have to reduce the demand at busy times otherwise there will be big trouble. One way to do that, requiring a lot of political courage, is to do it through charging a different amount at different times of day. -- Northern line extension is to be paid for by developers. City Hall once more powers. Could Transport for London set up a property company? Without good transport infrastructure, a lot of developments will not happen. We have to make sure that a lot of that development, which is currently being paid for by the private sector, comes back to find new public transport. That is what happens in Hong Kong. That is why they don’t have to put any subsidy, any taxpayer’s subsidy, into public transport. We have a plan to deal with this population increase. Divided we plan -- continue to plan and invest, there will be capacity. West London, which will eventually be a huge transport hub.

The owners of fishing lakes in Hertfordshire claim dredging work designed to stop a repeat of last year’s flooding - could ruin their businesses. Homes and roads in Rickmansworth were flooded last February when the River Chess burst its banks. But the Environment Agency says clearing silt and reeds from the river will help stop it overflowing again. Yvonne Hall takes up the story. It’s enough to make a grown fisherman weep. This flows into our lake. It is normally crystal clear. About 18 inches deep. You should be able to see the bottom. All of this silt will go into the lake and get deposited. This is where the silt is flowing into. The fishing lake Rickmansworth, threatening hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of ash. The silt, mainly mud, sand and nitrates, is coming from dredging work further up the river. -- thousands of pounds of fish. These bales are clearly not working. The silt levels could lead to reduced oxygen levels. That will result in loss of fish. We cannot afford to replace those fish. It would be ruined as a fishery. The fisheries claim they were not warned by the Environment Agency that dredging work would be taking place. They’re trying to clear thousands of tonnes of silt that has built up in the River Chess in Rickmansworth over the last 30 years, to try to stop the river flooding again. During last debris’s heavy rainfall, homes and roads nearby were badly flooded. Nobody from the agency is available for interview, but in a statement it said it wanted everyone -- for interview, but in a statement it said it wanted everyone -- warned everyone in the area that this work would be taking place, and that some silt may go downstream. Is this a test put in barriers to try to stop the silt flowing through, but according to the fisheries these aren’t working. Some now fear that the silt building on downstream will increase the risk of flooding, rather than lessen it. It is now so narrow that hardly any boats can get through. When it does flood, there is no channel for it so it will go straight over to our property. Many are calling for more permanent solution is to stop flooding, such as extensive repairs to badly damaged river banks. 1Many will remember her for her debut film role in the 1986 film ""Mona Lisa"" where she plays a high-class prostitute. So Cathy Tyson’s latest London stage role couldn’t be more different. She stars as Marie Curie - in a play which explores the personal challenges that threatened the reputation of the Nobel Prize winning chemist. Our Entertainment Correspondent, Brenda Emmanus, went to meet her ahead of opening night. What do you mean, goodbye? You don’t mean forever? I mean, in the sense that we’ll never touch each other again, I suppose. The personal crisis that threatened to destroy her professional reputation. Cathy Tyson stars as Marie Curie, whose affair with a married physicist caused one of the many tribulations in the life of the great scientist. She had a relationship with someone who was still married, so she broke a rule. Working relationships that she had, she was denied entry to certain things. Shejust kept going on and on. What do you mean, goodbye? Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first and only woman to win twice and the only woman to do so in multiple sciences. This is new knowledge! The atom is not what anyone thought it was. In Alan Alda’s production, her great academic achievements are celebrated and her human flaws exposed. Playing this big icon, I was all, ""Yes, she’s great. There’s nothing wrong with her. Isn’t she amazing?"" But then I suddenly thought, ""Oh, but, God, yeah, she’s a person."" I’m not saying we are in any way defaming the name of Marie Curie, but that was good for me as an actor, which I think is the genius of Alan Alda, to show this person. He wants to win friends and influence people. How does he do that? Through those like me. Despite her varied theatre and screen experience, it’s the 1986 film Mona Lisa that has come to define Cathy’s career. It gave me a great break. I am grateful, that’s what I feel. I cannot be anything other than grateful. The North London-based actress is now attempting to have more control over her career by writing and starting her own theatre company. But, until the end of February, she will be at the Tabard Theatre as a celebrated scientist. Time for a check on the weather withjohn Hammond. A few of us will see a flake or two of snow. Not a complete blizzard job. just a few wintry showers overnight. One or two of us will wake up to a dusting. We have cloud increasing from the North. Some of this cloud is a little bit lumpy. It’s these lumps of cloud which will start to bring a few flurries. Rain, sleet and snow. Temperatures is downwards. Especially across the more northern and western parts of our patch. There could be some ice when you have a coating of snow. It could be quite slippery. One or two -- for some of us, it wintry scene first thing. Flurries drifting away West. Depositing a centimetre here or there. They will tend to clear away but it will be mighty cold with a fresh breeze. It will feel colder than today despite the sunshine. Up to 6 degrees.

The main headlines: The entire council leadership in Rotherham has resigned, following a child abuse scandal. A government report accused the council of failing to protect young people from sexual abuse and of trying to cover it up. That’s all from us for now. But we’ll be back later during the 10pm news. From me and the team here, thanks for watching and have a lovely evening. GRAYSON PERRY: The great white male, white middle-class men, probably only make up about 10% of the population and yet they...

Don’t eat these. They have poisonious. They are apricot kernels. Why the fine? Dr Saleyah Ahsan has the answer. Finding a cure for cancer is one of medical science’ greatest challenges. Some people claim they have the answer and it lies not in a lab, but in a handful of seeds. These are apricot kernels. Online, you will find claims they contain a vitamin called B17 and that it can cure all kinds of cancer. There is no such vitamin as B 17. It’s a compound. It’s a controlled substanced in the UK because it’s potentially harmful. By selling apricot kernels companies can side step the laws that control medicines. This company has been selling kernels by the bag load. Based in Leigh on Sea in Essex. The stars didn’t know the is vitamin service was promoting B 17 as a ",,

Tonight at Ten, Rotherham Council is found to be in complete denial about the scale of child sex abuse in the town. The authority is declared ""not fit for purpose"" and is ""failing in its duty to protect vulnerable children"". The entire leadership is standing aside. Ministers have ordered Government managers to get ready to take over. The crimes committed against children ars so appalling. The council’s remedy is so utterly inadequate that the Government cannot, in good conscience, turn a blind eye. We’ll have details of the findings, on the day a new chair was appointed to lead an inquiry into historical child sex abuse in England and Wales. The high courtjudge from New Zealand will be given the power to compel witnesses to give evidence. Motorists capture the moment a plane crashed in Taiwan, killing at least 31 people. Half the population can expect to be diagnosed with cancer at some stage in their lives, according to the latest research. And England coach Stuart Lancaster talks to us ahead of Friday night’s opening game of the 6 Nations in Cardiff. On BBC London: Tomorrow’s bus strike is on. Transport for London say passengers should expect ""significant disruption."" And claims that homelessness in the capital is far worse than the official figures say. Good evening. Rotherham Council has been found to be in ""resolute denial"" about the extent of child sex abuse in the town and has been declared ""not fit for purpose"". The entire cabinet is to stand down, and Government commissioners are set to take control. An official report says the council is ""failing in its duty to protect vulnerable children and young people"". The investigation started last year following the revelation that 1,400 children had been abused by men, mainly of Pakistani heritage. Investigators found the council had a ""deep-rooted"" culture of cover-ups. Our social affairs correspondent Alison Holt has the story. Lying at the heart of the South Yorkshire town of Rotherham, a council where according to today’s report, there’s a culture of covering up uncomfortable truths and failing to protect those who are vulnerable. You could tell from my appearance. I went to five and half stone and different coloured hair. I weren’t going to school, I weren’t going home. There was no way they could not have realised that something was wrong. But again and again, this girl’s voice and the voices of other children being sexually exploited in the town were ignored. There were various authorities that knew what were going on. This young woman was 14 when she was first abused. A child protection officer, she ignored it. Someone from social services ignored it. There were various meetings about me, which were saying that if there was anybody found to be dead, it would be me. The report examines the council’s failure to act over many years. It found a local authority not fit for purpose, with a culture of bullying and ongoing denial. Over a long period of time, the council has not really listened to inspections, to reports, to people trying to get them to improve what they’re doing. The council’s former leader Roger Stone refused to be interviewed by the inquiry team. He is described in the report as being a bully. The former deputy leader is said to have been liked by some, but feared by others. Neither wanted to comment today. This afternoon, the Communities Secretary announced he was putting in his own commissioners to run the council. The crimes committed against children are so appalling, the council’s remedy is so utterly inadequate that the Government cannot, in good conscience, turn a blind eye. They were abducted, beaten and intimidated. It was a report last August that found that more than 1,400 children had been sexually exploited in the town over 16 years, with many of the perpetrators said to be of Pakistani heritage, an issue ducked for years. Now even this report is said to be disputed by councillors. It makes me angry. For this doctor, whose own warnings to police and council ten years ago were ignored, that is shocking. Whether it is one victim or the 1,400 or more victims, what she says stands. And whilst people continue to deny it, it kind of makes the whole situation worse. And as I say, it is an insult to the victims. The team behind today’s report has also filed files on one existing councillor and a former councillor to the National Crime Agency. The NCA says it has been asked to examine matters which are potentially criminal. Rotherham Council says its current leader has resigned, and the Cabinet will go as soon as the new commissioners are in place. Alison Holt, BBC News, Rotherham. As the extent of Rotherham’s failings became clear, the Home Secretary was giving details of the new independent inquiry into historical child sexual abuse in England and Wales. The original inquiry was announced seven months ago. Today, Theresa May appointed justice Lowell Goddard, a high court judge from New Zealand, to lead the inquiry, which will have the power to compel witnesses to attend. Our home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds has more details. Could it be third time lucky? After losing Baroness Elizabeth Butler Sloss and the Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf because they were seen as too close to the establishment, the Government has searched the world for a replacement, and in New Zealand found justice Lowell Goddard. She claimed to have no agenda or preconceptions, and she is prepared to live in Britain and spend years hearing evidence about child abuse. Ifeel that spend years hearing evidence about child abuse. I feel that this inquiry is so important and at the forefront of it are so many victims, and more than 100,000, I believe, who really require answers. She sits in New Zealand’s High Court. She has led an inquiry into police handling of child abuse cases. She has been criticised for a ruling which defended a paedophile’s right to privacy, but two other courts agreed with her. Today, emerging from a meeting with the Home Secretary, survivors of child abuse in their support. I have every confidence that this will be an excellent appointment and widely welcomed by the people who are at the heart of this inquiry, which are the survivors of childhood abuse. This, 25 years ago, is one of them. I would come home, and there would be people there, waiting for me. Or I would be taken somewhere else to meet men that I had been told to make happy. Becky, not her real name, felt hope when the inquiry was announced, but when it descended into chaos and arguments, like many, she was left confused and upset. The question is, can their trust be restored? I would say that as survivors, as a group, we find it hard to trust whatever form the inquiry takes. There will be people who cannot trust that, for their own reasons, because of their own stories. The Government today decided against a royal commission on child abuse, like the one underway in Australia, but it has beefed up the inquiry’s powers. It will now be a statutory inquiry. That meansjustice Lowell Goddard That means justice Lowell Goddard will That meansjustice Lowell Goddard will have the power to look at restricted police and MI5 documents and call witnesses, whether they like it or not. They will give evidence under oath, which means they will need lawyers. And so the whole inquiry will be bigger and more expensive. The inquiry will cover a case of abuse and the response to it in schools, children’s homes and other institutions. It could take five years to complete and it is likely to delve into the heart of power itself. The Archbishop of Canterbury says that business leaders have to consider how they can support society, and he urged big firms to pay taxes in the countries where they earned the money. He spoke on the day Labour and the Conservatives attacked each other’s attitudes to business, with Labour demanding that a tax loophole for some of the country’s biggest investors needed to be closed. Our business editor Kamal Ahmed has the story. Nice to meet you. Politicians often like to be highly visible when chatting to business. You’ve had a difficult winter, haven’t you? Theyjudge the public like parties that are on the side of wealth and job creators, but the two major parties are now at war over who is best for business. The issue hit the headlines last weekend when the head of one of the UK’s biggest retailers, Boots, suggested a Labour victory at the next general election would be a catastrophe. Last night, Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, had something of a memory malfunction when he failed to remember the name of one of Labour’s business backers. Um... the, um... Bill... the former Chief Executive of EDS, whom I was just talking to, just a few moments ago, before I came over - the former Chief Executive of EDS? Of course. He’s a big supporter of ours. What’s his name? But... to be honest, it’sjust gone from my head, which is a bit annoying at this time of night. Today, at Prime Minister’s Questions, David Cameron turned the knife. The day after his Shadow Chancellor was asked on the television, could he think of one single business leader, do you know what he said? Do you know what he said, Mr Speaker? He said, Bill somebody. LAUGHTER Mr Speaker, Bill somebody’s not a person. Bill somebody’s La bour’s policy. Ed Miliband responded by going on the front foot. He said the Conservatives were more interested in supporting who he described as ""tax avoiders."" I’ll tell him what people on this side are doing. We’re standing up for hard-working families and businesses while he’s a friend of the tax avoiders. The President of the CBI told me businesses have every right to speak out about their views and that he was worried about policies associated with both parties. I think we’re concerned about having a proper debate about the European Union. Recognising the reforms that we believe are achievable. Recognising how important it is for us today in the European Union. We’re also concerned to ensure that there’s, you know, a real understanding that if this recovery is going to be sustainable, and lead to better wages, it needs to have policies that encourage investment and improve productivity. The issue just doesn’t involve politicians and businesses. Other powerful voices have said this goes beyond what happens in the election. With the battle raging over the role of business in society, and politicians trading blows over whether they are pro or anti business, I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury here at Lambeth Palace. I asked him what role should companies play in creating a just society? The Archbishop told me that he supported wealth creators, but all businesses should pay a fair rate of tax. There’s always been the principle that you pay tax where you earn the money and if you earn the money in a particular country, the revenue service of that country needs to get a fair share of what you’ve earnt. Companies know their behaviour will remain in the spotlight and they can expect many more visits from politicians hoping to convince the voters that they are building the best case for business and the economy. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. Nick Robinson is in Westminster. What did you make of labour’s line on business today? It was striking that Ed Miliband chose to march towards the sound of Tory gunfire. The Labour leader knew that if he raised business today in the House of Commons, you would be taunted by David Cameron for his awkward relationship and for that memory lapse by Ed Balls. But he chose to do it, so the question is why? The answer is simple. He believes that he can be popular and win an election if voters believe he is, in that favourite phrase of the party strategists, on your side, and being on your side means being willing to stand up not to business, but too bad business practice, whether it is tax avoidance or overcharging. He thinks that is a vote winner. The Tories equally think they can portray him as an anti-business leader, and that will win votes, which was why they got many of their supporters to weigh in after that criticism from the head of Boots. But what is really striking is that the president of the CBI was telling our business editor tonight, in a form of code - our business editor tonight, in a form of code - look, this Mrs are worried about the Tories may be taking us out of Europe, and they are worried about Labour threatening investment with their policies. Ed Miliband was told that more of those worries about the Tories would be exposed in public, if only he sounded a bit more pro-business. It is advice he has chosen, in a calculated way, to ignore. Injordan, King Abdullah has declared what he called a ""relentless war"" against the extremists of Islamic State on their own territory. He was speaking a day after images were published of a jordanian pilot being burned to death by IS. Within hours, jordan announced it had executed two al-Qaeda militants and said it would step up its role in the American-led military coalition against IS. Our correspondent, Paul Adams, reports from the pilot’s home village injordan. Far from jordan’s capital, in the peaceful hills above the Dead Sea, the very public rituals of condolences. A chance to share the family’s grief, to embrace, to pray, and grapple with the sheer horror of what’s happened. Moaz al-Kasasbeh will spend much of the next three days here in this tent. That h in that time he will meet a great many well-wishers. He will hear a great number of questions, how, if at all, canjordan punish those responsible for his son’s death? What should the country’s role be in the US-led coalition against Islamic State. You said last week that you were not sure that this was jordan’s fight. Do you still feel that way today? TRANSLATION: I am Do you still feel that way today? TRANSLATION: Iam now TRANSLATION: I am now certain that jordan must fight them in their high hoodouts. Outside our borders, because they are coming for us. We must fight them before they reach us. But before that, a gesture of revenge, this predawn convoy carrying the bodies of two Al-Qaeda prisoners. Their longstanding death penalties now carried out. Later, on the road to the airport, displays of solidarity and defiance as King Abdullah returned home from Washington. This was hardly spontaneous. As the King swept through it was heartfelt. This small country rallying together at a time of wounded pride. jordan says it is fighting back. The King meeting security officials spoke of a relentless war to pretext faith, values and human principles. The government is increasing its participation in the US-led coalition. How far? Nobody was talking about ground troops.s we’re talking about helping the Iraqi military. We’re talking about helping the Syrian moderate opposition, or Peshmerga troops, in order to fight on the ground. The soldiers who come to offer their condolences don’t expect to be thrust into the fight. The trauma of the past 10-days has brought the battle against Islamic State that much closer. Paul Adams, battle against Islamic State that much closer. PaulAdams, BBC much closer. Paul Adams, BBC News, jordan. The head of the official inquiry into the Iraq War, Sirjohn Chilcott, has refused to set a timetable for publishing his report. Sirjohn told MPs he’d ""underestimated"" the time it would take to study up to 150,000 documents and he did not want to ""arouse false hopes"" by giving a publication date. Peter Greste, the Australian journalist freed after more than a year in an Egyptian prison, has arrived home. He was reunited with his parents in Brisbane. He said he was ""ecstatic"" to be home, but renewed his demand that Egypt also release his two colleagues still in jail. In Taiwan, at least 31 people have died and others are still missing after a plane crashed into a river shortly after take-off from an airport in Taipei. The passengers were mostly Chinese tourists on board the TransAsia Airways plane which hit a bridge before plunging into the Keelung River. Dramatic images of the crash were recorded by drivers on the bridge. Our correspondent john Sudworth’s report contains flash photography. In the centre of Taiwan’s capital city, Taipei this morning, drivers catch a glimpse of something falling from the sky. The twin-propeller plane, with 58 people on board, appears to have suffered a sudden loss of power shortly after take-off. Another car, also fitted with a dashboard camera, was even closer. The plane wing tip can be seen striking the roof of the taxi in front. The plane finally came to rest upside down and broken in a shallow river. That anyone could survive might seem extraordinary, but 15 people were rescued, including a two-year-old boy. By night fall, they had located the cockpit. The last recorded words from the flight deck had been ""mayday, mayday, engine flame out."" The work is continuing late into the night, they’ve brought in heavy lifting gear and, as you can see, a large part of the plane has now been brought out onto the river bank. There are still some submerged sections, where bodies could be trapped, but after so long in the water, this is no longer a rescue mission, but a recovery operation. This is the second fatal accident for the Taiwan-based TransAsia Airways in less than a year. The black boxes will hold the key as to why, in good weather, a relatively new plane, with experienced pilots, appears to just fall out of the sky. john Sudworth, BBC News, Taipei. After the first prosecution of its kind in Britain, an NHS doctor has been found not guilty of performing female genital mutilation - or FGM - on a young mother. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena had been accused of carrying out the illegal procedure after the woman gave birth at the Whittington Hospital in London in 2012. The jury at Southwark Crown Court took less than half an hour to clear him. june Kelly’s report contains flash photography. REPORTER: How do you feel about the verdict? He’s the up and coming young doctor who became a criminal suspect, but today it took the jury less than half an hour to clear Dhanuson Dharmasena of subjecting one of his patients to female genital mutilation. That patient had under gone FQGM when she was six. Her identity is being protected. The doctor had to reverse the damage that had been done to the young woman so he could deliver her baby. He was accused of carrying out a procedure on her said to be the same as the original FGM she had under gone. The doctor said he didn’t realise he’d broken the law. He said he had never received any training in dealing with FGM and it was the first time he’d treated a patient who had undergone it. After the birth the Trust here launched an investigation. Then went to the police. One anti-FGM campaign, Nimco Ali, believes it’s right this case was tested in the courts. Nobody’s above the law and you cannot necessarily say that we cannot prosecute people that might have committed FGM or people suspect might have committed FGM, and I think that’s a great thing that this case has done that. The law applies like, you know, to everybody and anybody. FGM has been illegal in the UK for 30 years. This was the first prosecution and its being questioned by one senior gynaecologist. Why do I think the case was brought? I think there was a lot of pressure to bring about a successful prosecution for FGM and they were looking around to see if they could find one, but this was not the right one to bring about. The CPS insisted it was a fair decision to put him in the dock. He is now facing an investigation by the General Medical Council. june Kelly, BBC News. One in two people in the UK will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, according to new analysis by Cancer Research UK. The estimate - based on the latest methodology - replaces a previous forecast that one in three people would be affected. So half the population is expected to be diagnosed at some stage due to longer life expectancy and lifestyle factors. While cancer survival rates are improving, it’s still believed that around one in four people will die from the disease. Our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, has more details. Cancer touches every family in the UK. Sue Deans, who’s 69, has had melanoma, a form of skin cancer, twice in the past 15 years, but both times was successfully treated. I think you just have to face it. There’s no point in being terrified. It’s a fact of life now. A lot of people are going to get cancer, especially in old age. And, often... well, it won’t be a death sentence for a lot of people. They’ll get treatment and they will live with it. So what are the reasons behind the increase? Well, the older we get, the more likely we are to get cancer. So it’s no surprise that most of the increase in cases is due to us living longer. Average life expectancy has been soaring to nearly 83 for women and 79 for men. Back in 1980, the lifetime risk of getting cancer was one in four, by 1990, it was one in three and now it’s one in two. But cancer is not always inevitable. Part of the rise in cases is due to lifestyle. Cancer Research UK reckons four in ten cancers are avoidable if we live more healthily. We need to stop smoking. We need to moderate our alcohol intake. We need to do more exercise and a healthy diet and also, for those patients that have got a cancer, we need to treat it earlier because we know that patients who have an early cancer, it’s more easier to treat successfully. A huge increase in cases, combined with expensive new treatments, mean the costs of cancer care will continue to soar. But with half of patients now surviving at least a decade, living with cancer will increasingly become the norm. Fergus Walsh, BBC News. On Friday night in Cardiff there’ll be more than 70,000 rugby fans packed into the Millennium Stadium to see Wales playing England in the opening game of this year’s Six Nations. And, for Stuart Lancaster, the former teacher who’s now England’s national coach, it marks the start of a momentous year as he leads the team into a World Cup at home. He believes it’s the ""biggest ever year"" for the sport in the UK, as he explained to our sports editor, Dan Roan. West Park under-14s in Leeds are a typical grass-roots rugby team, except for one thing - their assistant coach just happens to be the England manager. just get the ball moving. So don’t kick all the time. OK. Let’s keep playing rugby. Yeah? Stuart Lancaster’s son, Daniel, plays here and his famous dad can’t resist prowling the touchline every time he has a free weekend. Go low. Pull them out, Ben. Ben, pull them out. You’ve got a good defensive line organised. It needs the manager to get them... Here in the team’s clubhouse, Lancaster told me he wouldn’t have it any other way. I love doing it and I definitely don’t see it as extra work. They think - oh, my God, the England coach is there. They’re keen to chat, have photos and everything else. You realise the impact of a successful England team on grass-roots rugby and the importance of the connection between the England team and grass-roots rugby. It was back to the dayjob this afternoon, Lancaster preparing his injury-hit squad for England’s Six Nation match on Friday against Wales. A team they play at the World Cup in September. So how’s he dealing with the pressure? It’s lying awake at night thinking, feeling the sense of responsibility, wanting to do the bestjob you can. The Wales game is a big game because we play them in our Pool. Selection, yeah, it consumes every minute of my day and when I make up in the morning, it’s the first thing I think about- and so it should be. England were humiliated by a rampant Wales two years ago and Lancaster admits they may still be lacking in the experience needed for a World Cup. I think, in terms of the evolution of the team and the age of the team, it would be nice to have a little bit more time. Our experience is probably a little bit under where we’d like to be. Here at their training camp, Lancaster and his players know that a World Cup on home soil means massive expectation, but also opportunities, for both the team and the sport. The third biggest sporting event in the world is sat on our back door and it’s coming round the corner. It’s notjust a two-week event, it’s a seven-week event. So I think the World Cup in this country will be huge and it’s certainly the biggest year for rugby we’ll ever know. Back at West Park Rugby Club they may not see quite as much of Lancaster this year, but he believes his grounded approach will stand him in good stead as the pressure intensifies. Dan Roan, BBC News.

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. David Cameron says that thousands more schools could be forced to accept new leadership if the Conservatives win the General Election. He said any school rated by inspectors as requiring improvement, that’s about 3,500, will automatically be forced to become an academy, unless it can show a clear plan for rapid improvement. The Prime Minister also confirmed that funding for schools in England will continue to be protected. Our Education Correspondent Alex Forsyth reports. How does religion make that impact? This academy replaced a struggling school. Since being renamed and rebuilt, its results have vastly improved. The pupils say the change is obvious. I have a mentor, like a businessmen for, helping me find out what kind of career I want to go into. One main thing are the facilities that really changed for me, such as the library we are in now, it didn’t always used to be a library. There are loads of facilities. The principal says becoming an academy free from council control with more autonomy over things like the curriculum’s made the difference. It’s about independence and that’s really valuable to us. We work with the local authority, we talk about being family of schools, but we do really respect our independence. Today, the Prime Minister said under a future Conservative Government, coasting schools Conservative Government, coasting schools that show little improvement could be taken over by new leaders or academy chains. We are waging war on mediocrity, saying no more sink schools and no more bog-standard schools either. How do we do this? By saying to schools, if you are not good or outstanding, you have to change. But some teaching unions say schools shouldn’t be forced to become academies. Last week, a committee of MPs said it’s too early to tell whether they improve standards overall. Labour, which first introduced academies, says they are not the only solution. What the Labour wants to see is high quality teaching in every classroom, great head teachers turning round the schools. What we don’t think is that same my naming a school an academy necessarily achieves that. How were the Romans providing this protection... While this school claims its change in structure has worked, there is still no consensus on what is best for classrooms overall. Alex is with me now. David Cameron confirmed this morning that the schools budget will continue to be protected. There is a war on mediocrity, schools being taken over. There is that question over whether academies work. Some say the jury is out. There is also a question on whether or not there are enough high-performing leaders and academy chains to take over the schools and how much that costs. David Cameron said this morning the school’s budget would be ringfenced through the next Parliament. That’s already been the case over this Parliament and despite that, some schools say they are struggling to make ends meet because costs have still risen. Things like increased pension contributions for teachers, there’s still a question over what this means for early still a question over what this mea ns for early years means for early years funding, so before children start school and post-I6 funding, so A-levels, all of that, some schools say, pressurises their budgets already. While many will welcome the commit not to cut spending on education, others will say it doesn’t go far enough. Let’s speak to our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith. Staying with education, Labour has come in for criticism over its policy on university tuition fees, before the policy has even been formally announced? |,m I’m thinking MrMiliband I’m thinking Mr Miliband and Cameron ought to Don a pinny, because this is turning out to be the old mother hub ahhed policy. There is no dosh, Mr Cameron is under pressure to explain how he is going to ringfence the budget and why Mr Miliband is under even more pressure to say how he’s going to meet his ambition of cutting tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 a year, a move that would cost over the next Parliament between EIO and £12 cost over the next Parliament between £10 and £12 billion, so a huge amount of money. Her has asked Ed Balls to see if he can come up with a way of paying for it. So far he doesn’t seem to have been able to do that. Now the universities have Waded in saying they think the whole idea is implausible, that it would damage the university sector, damage the economy and, if Mr Miliband really wants the economy and, if Mr Miliband really wa nts to really wants to help students, why not raise maintenance grants? And there is the beginning of a whisper that maybe to get out of this particular bind, Labour instead might opt for a review of university funding after the next election. Officially, Labour deny that, but it would be one way of getting out of this fix. A second UK military healthcare worker has been flown back to England following ""likely exposure"" to the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone. The patient has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in north London. What do we know about what happened to them, bran within? Both these health care workers, nurses or doctors, suffered what’s called a needle stick injury. That could be something as small as a pin prick from the tip of a needle or another very sharp object. It’s gone through the protective layers of gloves and through their skin and that exposes them to the risk of the ebola virus going directly into the blood stream. As a precaution, they are in isolation at the Royal Free Hospital being monitored. Neither have symptoms and they are awaiting the results of blood tests that’ll either confirm they have been infected with the virus or rule it out. Later in the programme we’re reporting from Liberia on the first trials of a vaccine against ebola. The widow of the spy, Alexander Litvinenko, who died after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium at a hotel in London, is preparing to give evidence at the public inquiry into his death. Marina Litvinenko has claimed her husband’s killing in 2006 was ordered by the Kremlin. Our Security Correspondent Gordon Corera is at the Royal Courts ofjustice in London. This is the second week of the inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko and this morning for the first time, we heard from his widow, Marina. We heard about his early career in the Russian Security Services, about assassination plots and about Vladimir Putin. Marina Litvinenko arriving this morning, a woman who spent years fighting for the truth about her husband’s death. A former Russian $PYÂ husband’s death. A former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko died of radioactive polonium poisoning eight years ago in a London Hospital, pointing the finger of blame at the Kremlin. Today, we learnt he joined the KGB, Russia’s secret police in the final years of the Cold War. Later once named the FSB, he was part of an antiterrorist unit. In 1994, an insurgency began in Chechnya. Mrs Litvinenko said her husband became disillusioned by the scale of civilian casualties and after he interrogated a 17-year-old and learnt why he was fighting. He nextjoined a specialist team investigating organised crime. Here, he met businessman and politician Boris Berezovsky. Some of his officers asked him something highly unusual. Speaking in the inquiry, Mrs Litvinenko said fellow officers asked her husband of Mr Berezovsky ""you know him well, would you kill him"". Litvinenko’s angerat him"". Litvinenko’s anger at corruption him"". Litvinenko’s angerat corruption in the FSB led him to speak out publicly at this press conference. The man who was then Head of The FSB and to whom Litvinenko complained in person, was Vladimir Putin, now Russia’s President. After that press conference, Alexander Litvinenko said to his wife that he thought he would either be killed or arrested. Soon after he came to Britain and then in 2006, he met his death. His widow Marina continues to give evidence this afternoon. A record numb burr of complaints have been made against police in England and Wales. Figures from the Independent Police Complaints Commission show there were nearly 35,000 cases involving complaints in 2013-14, a 15% increase on the previous year and the highest since the IPCC was established in 2004. The family of the Australian journalist Peter Greste have spoken of theirjoy and relief after he’s been freed after more than 400 days injail in Egypt. The Al-jazeera reporter was arrested in 2013 and found guilty last year of aiding the banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation, charges which campaigners said were bogus. He’s heading home to Australia but the family said he would not rest until his two colleagues jailed with him were also freed. john Donnison sent this report. At last, for the Greste family, something to smile about. After 400-odd days, a son and brother finally heading home. I’m ecstatic. Ijust can’t say how happy! I’m ecstatic. Ijust can’t say how happy I am about it all. I’m very excited and pleased and thank goodness this is all over. To me, it’s yet to quite sink in where we are, what’s happened. The family say Peteris are, what’s happened. The family say Peter is safe in Cyprus with his brother Mike enjoying a few luxuries not readily available in Cairo’s infamous prison. Apparently last night, Mike and Peter had beer and pork. It’s more than a year since the Al-jazeera journalist was arrested with his two colleagues, Mohammed Fahmy and Baha Mohammed, charged with aiding the opposition Muslim Brotherhood, a claim they vehemently denied. The Greste family has campaigned tirelessly for their release and today theirjoy was tempered by the fact that only one man has his freedom. Peterwas fact that only one man has his freedom. Peter was arrested with Baha and Mohammed and they also deserve to be free. Peter won’t rest until they are released from prison. We hope that’ll follow in the very near future. The challenge will be to keep the momentum of their campaign going until that’s achieved. Peter Greste’s now enjoyed a first day of freedom. He is said to be gathering his thoughts in Cyprus before making the long journey home here to Queensland. But for the families of his colleagues, Baha and Mohammed, they face yet another night with their loved ones in jail for doing theirjobs. Let’s speak now to our correspondent, Orla Gearin, who is in Cairo for us. What are the chances of the remaining journalists being freed? I would say for Mohammed Fahmy, they are pretty good. He’s a dual national of Egypt and Canada. We understand there are active moves under way to try to bring his case to a resolution. His relatives have been unwilling to speak today, perhaps concerned about jeopardising anything at the last moment. This appears to be around his nationality, his Egyptian nationality. We were told that he was asked to give that up in order to pave the way for his path away to Canada. He did on his own Twitter account yesterday complain and say why should somebody be asked to relinquish their citizenship in order to be freed having committed to crime. So there is still an issue around that. We know his fiance has been given a visa to travel to Canada with him and sources close to the presidency are saying he should be on his way within days. There are more concerns about Baha, the Egyptian national in the case, who does not have a foreign passport and whose family are extremely concerned that he could quite literally be left behind injail. The time isjust coming up 0 to 1. 156789 our top story: David Cameron has pledged to increase spending on schools in England if the Conservatives win the general election. Still to come: The ad campaign that saved thousands of people from suffering long-term disabilities. Coming up. Magna Carta, written in 1215, laid the foundations for democracy in Britain. It established the principle that nobody, not even the monarch, is above the law, and it paved the way for ourjustice system. Well, it’s now 800 years since its creation, and to mark the occasion, the four remaining original versions are being brought together for the first time at the British Library. Our correspondent Nick Higham has more. Salisbury Cathedral, a glorious example of the beauty and splendour of the Middle Ages. This is one of the cathedral’s greatest treasures, a reminder of the grubbier side of medieval politics, the official record of a deal thrashed out between King john and his rebellious barons. At the British Library today, all four of the surviving original copies of Magna Carta, brought together for the first time ever. The Salisbury copy has never travelled. We put it in a quarry during the Second World War for self keeping -- safekeeping in Wiltshire, but apart from that it has always beenin but apart from that it has always been in the Cathedral archive. So this is an extraordinary moment to find these documents which are not just about historical narrative, they are about the very essence of who we are as people. Magna Carta was agreed between the King and his most powerful subject here at Runnymede near the Thames. It was seminal moment for the English and the Americans who put up this monument. What was agreed here still matters. It is Magna Carta which established the principle that even rulers are not above the law. You cannot take a man’s property or liberty away from him without a proper trial. Two contemporaries, fed up with the King’s Ardent -- arbitrary rule and taxes, it was simply a peace treaty to head off Civil War. simply a peace treaty to head off CivilWar. It failed, incidentally. It is thought there were 17 copies sent out to the bishops, not the county sheriffs who were appointed hy county sheriffs who were appointed by the King. The last thing they wanted to do was to send the charter to the sheriffs because the sheriffs were the very people under attack. If you sent them to the sheriffs, each as Sheriff is in charge of his county, it will disappear into his castle and you will never see it-- see it again. The British Library has many documents on display. Magna Carta is less impressive. One is badly damaged and sealed Knot signed. Magna Carta is not signed by King john. They would all have had an impression of the great Seal of john attached to the bottom but only one of them today retains any trace of the seal. Today, the media were invited to see four pieces of remarkable history. Tomorrow it is the turn ofjust 1215 members of the public. The organisers of a campaign to raise awareness of the signs of a stroke say it has resulted in 4,000 fewer people suffering long-term disabilities. Public Health England says its Act FAST promotion, which was launched five years ago, is its most successful to date. Well, with me from Public Health England is Professorjulia Verne. Thank you very much for coming in. How is it that this campaign has been so successful? It is because the message is very simple. Act FAST. We look at the weakness of the face, weakness of the arms, then it is the speech and then time for action. We have had widespread campaigns in the media. It has been supplemented, by a story on Eastenders with Patrick suffering a stroke. That is important because in particular, African Caribbean ‘s and people of South Asian origin are at particular risk of developing strokes. You have a new campaign starting to warn people about the signs of mini strokes. Tell people about that. It is the same symptoms, weakness of the face, dropping of the mouth, slurring of the speech but sometimes they only last a few minutes or hours. They pass and people do not think anything of it. This is a medical emergency because it is a warning sign for a stroke. About one in five people who suffer mini strokes go want to have a severe stroke. If you anybody suffering the signs or you feel it yourself, call 999. The patient needs to be assessed in casualty, to start treatment to prevent a real stroke. Thank you. Australia’s Prime Minister Tony Abbott is launching a campaign after a series of broken election promises and a series of apparent gaffes. Laura Westbrook reports. Australia’s Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons lately. His most recent gaffe was on Australia day when he awarded Britain’s Prince Philip, the country’s highest honour, and knighthood. It sparked an online firestorm with many taking to Twitter to post their disbelief and mock the Prime Minister. It was this fury which was blamed for a surprise loss in state elections at the weekend. Now Mr Abbott is facing his biggest leadership challenge yet. The big problem for Tony Abbott is he comes off the back of the Queensland election on Saturday, when we saw the most astounding reverse in Australian political history. The party went from holding nine seats to looking like it will form the government perhaps in its own right. What has gone wrong? From the moment of his swearing-in, he has been facing criticism, for only having one woman in his cabinet. Then he appointed himself as the Minister for women. Then he appointed himself as the Ministerforwomen. He is as Then he appointed himself as the Minister for women. He is as well known for his famous IG smugglers as he is for the occasional slip of the tongue. No one, howeversmart he is for the occasional slip of the tongue. No one, however smart and however well educated, however experienced is the suppository of all wisdom. Perhaps one of his most talked about moments was during this radio interview. I survive on $400 a fortnight after I pay my rent and I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. There was a wink. But many see these problems as trivial compared to his broken election promises on health and the budget. In a speech on Monday he tried to save his place as Australia’s leader hy save his place as Australia’s leader by dropping a signature plan for paid parental leave. He also promised a more conservative approach on economic and security problems. Despite these latest attempts to save his job, problems. Despite these latest attempts to save hisjob, the opinion polls are heading in one direction, down. Many are asking, is this the beginning of the end for Tony Abbott? The former head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Khan, has gone on trial in Lille in northern France today. He’s accused of helping to hire sex workers for a string of private parties. Our correspondent Lucy Williamson joins us now from Paris. There have already been lurid claims about Mr Strauss-Kahn’s private life. Tell us about these accusations today. The chance he is UP accusations today. The chance he is up against of aggravated pimping covers quite a wide range of actions under French law. Everything to do with aiding or encouraging sex workers. These charges centre around Mr Strauss-Kahn’s role in a string of parties where high profile members of the French public went to meet sex workers and have various sexual encounters. Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he was at the parties, he was there as a consensual adult and a participant, but he had no knowledge of the women’s backgrounds. He did not play in organisational role and he denies all the charges against him. This has generated a great deal of interest in France. The French media are covering every twist and turn already as the trial gets under way. Dominic Strauss-Kahn was a huge political figure way. Dominic Strauss-Kahn was a huge politicalfigure here. At one point he was tipped to be the next president of France. His political career is in tatters now. But he is still thought of as a very prominent figure. A poll a few days ago said while most people had a negative opinion of him, the vast majority thought he would have made a better president than the one France has now. Thank you. 183 people have been sentenced to death in Egypt. 183 people have been sentenced to death by a court in Egypt, over the death of 12 policemen in 2013. The defendants were accused of storming Kerdasa police station, west of Cairo, after a sit-in protest by supporters of former President Morsi was broken up. The mass trial and sentencing is one of several to have sparked an international outcry. The leader of the Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine has announced plans to mobilise 100,000 men. The call-up is due start in ten days’ time. Fighting has escalated sharply in recent weeks and has claimed dozens of civilian lives. The trial in Seoul of Heather Cho, who delayed a flight because she was angry at the way she was served a portion of nuts, has been hearing from the chief purser. He told the court that Ms Cho, who is the daughter of the airline’s boss, treated flight crew like ""feudal slaves"". Our correspondent Steve Evans sent this report. Back to work for Park Chang-jin for the first time since the boss’s daughter got him thrown off the plane. Today in court, to testify against her. The purser said she was like a wild beast hunting its prey. She hit him with a tablet computer. She snarled, her teeth bared. Mrs Cho has apologised abjectly. But now she is behind bars and was taken to court in prison overalls. She said her anger was because she took herjob as airline executive in charge of cabin service too seriously, but she said it was wrong to be inconsiderate. Initially people were laughing at what happened on that flight, but now people are asking whether those events reflect something wider going on in this country? TRANSLATION: It was a revelation of how arrogant the privileged can be. They think they are above the law. TRANSLATION: By getting the appropriate punishment, I hope we can turn into a more mature society. The flight was turned back only 20 seconds from the gates. Inside, Mrs Cho was raging. Her anger has subsided, contrition has set in, but it maybe too late to save her from more time injail. Two bronze statues, which were dismissed as being by minor sculptors for more than a century, could in fact be by Michelangelo. Naked, muscular, and riding on ferocious panthers, the pair were identified from a tiny detail in a 500 year old drawing. If the finding is accurate, they are the only surviving Michelangelo bronzes in the world. Our arts editor, Will Gompertz reports. There has never been any doubt that these bronze sculptures are top quality. The elegant compositions are there for all to see. But the name of the artist who made them has long been disputed. It is an artworld whodunnit that has had historians scratching their heads since the sculptures first appeared in public more than a century ago. Curators at a museum in Cambridge think they have solved the case. They are magnificent sculptures that deserve to be seen by a wider public, but in recent months there has been this tremendously exciting suggestion that these are actually works by Michelangelo and represent an aspect of his work that has been lost. Now that is a big claim. It would make them the only known bronze sculptures in the world by Michelangelo, who it is thought produced them between carving David in 1501 and painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling in 1507. It is impossible to prove. There is this drawing from the time of showing a figure riding a panther which were copied. And these are anatomically similar to the male bronzers. And there are specialist x-rays which fit with Michelangelo retribution. It is impossible to prove. Although this latest research means that even if it is not case closed, there is at least a prime suspect. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today - David Cameron has pledged to increase spending on schools in England, if the Conservatives win the general election. In a moment, Sarah Keith-Lucas will be here with a full national weather forecast - plus the news where you are. But first with news of the football transfer deadline and all the rest of the day’s sport, here’s Katherine Downes. It’s Transfer Deadline day - and so far Chelsea are the biggest Premier League side doing business. They’ve sold German Andre Schurrle to Wolfsburg, which should mean then can now close a deal on Colombian wingerjuan Cuadrado from Fiorentina. Former Republic of Ireland international Kevin Kilbane joins us now. Do you think this is a good swap? jose Mourinho does not seem to have too much faith in Andrea Shola. -- Andre Schurrle. It is a basic swap. Two good players moving either way. Andre Shell was not really in favour with jose Mourinho Andre Shell was not really in favour withjose Mourinho this season so I think it makes sense. Let’s talk about another deal, not strictly a transfer, but Harry Caine has signed another 5.5 year deal at Spurs. He has been there a while. Good business, you would say? Yes, it is good news for Tottenham supporters. He is having a wonderful season. It shows what young players can do if they bide their time and he is having an excellent season this year and hopefully now for him, he can progress even further and get in the England squad. Any other deals that you have your ear across, Any other deals that you have your earacross, I ear across, I know you are in contact with loads of people throughout the day and got your finger on the pulse? Perhaps one could be Aaron Lennon moving out of Tottenham. There are a couple of clubs interested in him. Everton and Hull being two clubs, so we’ll see how that progresses through the day. Watch this space. And of course the BBC Sport website. Kevin, for now, thank you very much. There is been another blow for England ahead of the opening game of the Six Nations against Wales on Friday. David Wilson will miss the match with a neck injury. Wales coach Warren Gatland has announced the starting line-up. Sam Warburton will win his 50th cap, while winger George North and Richard Hibbrd return to the side. The New England Patriots have won the Super Bowl for the fourth time beating the Seattle sea hawks 28-24 in Phoenix. The sea hawks let slip a last-minute chance of victory thanks to what was described as the worst play in the history of football. joe Wilson reports. Rememberwhen history of football. joe Wilson reports. Remember when half time meant a cup of tea, Super Bowl gave you Katie Perry on board a giant origami tiger. There was nothing fake about the sporting excitement, luckily. In short, Seattle should have won. They were ten points ahead in the fourth quarter. Success depends on keeping your head. Tom Brady is good at that. Four times he threw for touchdowns and the Patriots led with two minutes left on the clock. Loads of time. Seattle yards from glory 20 seconds to play, sensible thing was to give the ball to someone to run, the risky thing was to throw it. Malcolm Butler of the Patriots snatched the ball. Tom Brady emotional, you feared tears might make his make-up run: It’sjust awe some. What an experience. A lot of mental toughness. A lot of physical toughness. We played against a phenomenal defence and just ultimately did enough. Brady is 37, from deflated balls to inflated prices and the sheer hype of this event, his experience was decisive. That’s all the sport. Back to you. Many thanks. Two health care workers are being tested for ebola here in Britain. In Liberia, the first large scale trials of a vaccine are due to begin. In the past year, nearly 9,000 people have died from the disease in west Africa. It’s hoped eventually, 30,000 volunteers will take part in the trials, testing vaccines produced by the company’s GSK and Merk. Let’s speak to our correspondent Mark Doyle. Who were the volunteers for the vaccine and how safe is it? Well, the people here who’re organising this say it’s very safe. The original phase one, if you like, the very early part of this trial, took place partly in Britain and partly in a number of other European and African countries. We’ve now got to the stage where it’s expanded into a large scale vaccine trial and the first relatively small number here in Liberia were vaccinated this morning. The people I’ve spoken to seem to understand that it’s a vaccine like any other, that the measles vaccine and the polio and so on had to have trials. Of course, ebola is more frightening in many ways but most Liberians I’ve spoken to seem to think it’s fine. The organisers are confident that they’ll have enough of the some 30,000 volunteers eventually. Mark, is there any sign of things improving, of the numbers of those contracting the disease going down? Yes. In the last few months, the numbers here in Liberia in particular have gone down drastically to a small handful. The number in Sierra Leone and Guinea is also going down, although it seems to be sticking somewhat in Guinea stubbornly. The numbers compared with last year definitely have gone down and this is as a result of the campaigns organised by the governments of this region and also the international medical aid they have received. Many thanks. Lest’s take a look at the weather now. HOW. It now. It started off on a cold note, the month of February and it’s going to stay that way over the next week or so. The wintry weather not going anywhere in a hurry. Some spells of sunshine around for many. If we look at the satellite image, it shows the cloud in the UK is thin with a few holes in the cloud. Allowing the sun to break through. Speckled cloud lurking out in the North Sea and that cloud will push further inland, bringing wintry flurries. A few degrees below average for the time of year. For many, we’ll see a fairly sunny and dry afternoon. Into this evening, that is when we see the return to more in the way of wintry showers, mainly across the eastern coasts of England and through parts of western Wales, the south-west of England and for Northern Ireland and western parts of Scotland. A return to some rain around the cost, but inland, some sleet and snow showers. Temperatures well below freezing, particularly in the countryside. A very cold night. There could be some iciness around and snow fall around the course of Tuesday morning. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, there could be a few fog patches here and there with sleet and snow showers, especially in the north. Largely dry and sunny conditions in Northern Ireland and in Wales as well. There could be the odd fog patch and one or two sleety showers lingering across western parts of Wales. Also towards Cornwall too. Much of England dry and fine. As we head further east, more in the way of cloud and that will bear a few rain showers around the coasts. Inland, some sleet and snow showers. They are getting pushed in on the cold north-easterly, so blowing off the North Sea bringing some snow howers to eastern counties. Further west, drier conditions through the day. Sunshine for many western areas in particular and another chilly feeling day with temperatures still below average. It will be another cold story as we move through Tuesday night into Wednesday and then what we are going to see is high pressure building in from the west so that becomes established across the UK. Fairly quiet weather on the cards as we look towards the latter part of the week. We’ll have a further snow shower in the east because the breeze picks up coming off the North Sea. Places like Northumberland towards Kent and Sussex seeing snow showers. Staying cold with the best of the sunshine for some western areas. Through the course of the week, for many, it’s staying cold with dry, sunny weather too to be enjoyed but always the risk of snow showers around. Snow and ice on the cards, keep tuned to your latest forecast for the warnings. A reminder of our top story: David Cameron has pledged to increase spending on schools in England if the Conservatives win the general election. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One, time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Alex Bushill. London’s population has reached a record high of 8.6 million. The last time the capital was that size was back in 1939, but the Second World War and a drop in industry led to a decline in numbers. Now, according to the Greater London Assembly the increase is set to continue. Could it be him perhaps? Or could it be her maybe, just two hours old? Very happy. Somewhere across London, possibly here at Hillingdon Hospital, there’sjust been a record breaking birth. It’s here in Hillingdon where the population has grown most since 1939, an 80% rise, 130,000 more people. London as a whole has grown steady since the 1980s when a new post-industrial economy took shape around finance and the City. The change was growth of employment. Employment had been declining, London lost a million manufacturing jobs over 50 years and it was when office and service sector employment started to grow again and offices were starting to be built in Central London. Thosejobs drew were starting to be built in Central London. Those jobs drew people back in. That was the trigger for London to grow again. It’s in Tower Hamlets in the shadow of the city where the population is growing fastest. Seems to be a lot of tailoring industries and manufacturing industries. The jews and Bengalis in the ‘70s and now new settlers. You have young, rich affluent people moving in. The communities mingling together. It’s been a really exciting time but also new ways of immigration, the hipsters and the trendy communities are coming into the areas. London’s population may now officially be the biggest it’s ever been, but it certainly hasn’t peaked. It’s set to keep on growing and growing. So what will that mean for the capital’s infrastructure, for etc education, transport, housing? Notjust in the short-term, but in the decades to come? All this week, we’ll be asking what the population increase will mean ",,

And an investigation is launched after a bus has its roof ripped off, injuring five people. Good evening and welcome to the BBC’s News at Six. The Prime Minister says the amount of school funding per pupil in England will be protected, if the Conservatives are still in power after the next election. David Cameron said that rising pupil numbers would actually mean that each school received more money. But Labour says it amounts to a spending cut for each pupil as it doesn’t taken inflation into account. Here’s our Political Editor, Nick Robinson. And there you have it! David Cameron’s new election promise to protect spending on English schools. But hold on, is this Conservative commitment really as generous as it might at first appear? We have demonstrated in the past five years that we can protect the schools’ budget while reducing the deficit and we will do so again. So, I can tell you, with the Conservative Government, the amount of money following your child into the school, that will not be cut. In Treasury speak, flat cash per pupil. Can we translate ""flat cash""? Anybody doing economics at this school knows that means a cut in real terms? school knows that means a cut in realterms? It real terms? It means money does not keep pace with inflation? What it means is the cash sum that follows your child into the school will not be cut. Maybe. But if prices do go up, the amount spent per pupil will not keep pace. The budget a school has might go up, though, simply because the number of pupils they take looks set to increase. I accept thatis take looks set to increase. I accept that is a difficult decision for some schools. The amount of cash per child is not going up by inflation. The amount of cash is staying the same. It is already difficult in some schools, particularly those like Southend High, a successful grammar school. It doesn’t benefit from those big top-up payments called the pupil premium which are given to schools which take a lot of kids from deprived homes. The head is campaigning for David Cameron to think again. His budget deficit next year looks to be around £250,000. It is the schools that are quiet, effective, efficient deliverers of superb outcomes that are in a position of where they can’t break even. His pupils say they are feeling the squeeze. We don’t have the money to function as a school. We can keep the lights on, but that’s about it. In lessons, if there’s hand-outs to be given out, sorry, there’s not enough for one each because of the printing costs. A3 paper is like gold dust. Only a few weeks ago, Tory Ministers were advised to dodge questions on school spending. Their briefing paper told them to say, ""Of course, there will be difficult decisions in the education budget in the next Parliament."" What does that mean? For schools as a whole, it looks like it is roughly like a real-terms freeze. The real amount of resources per pupil will go down. Actually, over this Parliament, that hasn’t gone down. Labour say the cat is out of the bag. But they won’t yet spell out what they’d spend. Do Labour promise to go further? Will there be real-terms increases in schools’ budgets? The Labour Party has always supported our education system and an Ed Miliband Government would continue to do so. We will set out that in the run-up to the General Election. The Lib Dems say they are committed to protecting the whole education budget. This will mean a real-terms squeeze on schools which they have not experienced in this Parliament because the Liberal Democrats insisted on protecting the schools’ Democrats insisted on protecting the schools’ budget, but if the Conservatives ended up governing by themselves, it would be a bad time for schools. There was no drum roll but David Cameron clearly thought it was a big deal that he promised to protect spending on every pupil in England’s schools. What he didn’t do is promise to protect it from inflation. He didn’t promise to protect the rest of the education budget. Nick Robinson, BBC News, Enfield, North London. Labour has been defending its idea of cutting university fees in England by up to a third, if it forms the next Government, despite warnings from vice-chancellors that their plan is ‘implausible’. Labour wants to cut the maximum fees from £9,000 to £6,000 a year- arguing that the current system is unsustainable. But universities say it would leave them with a multi-billion pound black hole in their funding. Here’s our Home Editor, Mark Easton. Within weeks of the last election, politicians were reminded how student loans spark passionate views. Labour’s election advisers are now calculating what a party promise of cutting tuition fees in England from £9,000 to £6,000 a year might be worth at the ballot box, but universities are already warning the idea isn’t worth a single extra vote. The sums don’t add up. We find that there is no way they can guarantee the substantial amount of funding - guarantee the substantial amount of funding - that would be EIO to I5 billion over the next five years at a time when the country is going to be facing further cuts. Universities in England are expanding rapidly with record numbers of UK and international students. Total income - £23.3 billion in 2012/13 - international students. Total income - £23.3 billion in 2012/13 - that is bmmu - £23.3 billion in 2012/13 - that is forecast to rise to £29.2 billion in 2016/17. Tuition fees from English and EU students currently brings in around £10 billion. If we were in Government now, we would be cutting the costs of going to university. Ed Miliband first suggested cutting tuition fees in England back in 2011. But the policy is expensive and some senior figures in his own party are less than enthusiastic. Today, the Labour Leader was asked to explain his position. We think we need to have a new system in place, we will announce that in the coming weeks. At the moment, it is not official party policy? As I said before, I think people should watch this space. Over four years ago, they told us they were going to fundamentally change and reduce the tuition fees. Four years later, they cannot tell us what they are going to put in their place. Universities aren’t just worried about Labour’s plan to cut tuition fees, they think all parties should promise to put them up because inflation has eaten away at their real value. inflation has eaten away at their realvalue. One real value. One problem for the Government is that many students never earn enough to repay their fees and the state picks up the tab. Here at Surrey University, students I spoke to generally thought tuition fees were fair. Seeing it go down is not a bad idea. fees were fair. Seeing it go down is nota bad idea. I’m not a bad idea. I’m quite happy at £9,000. The education is worth it. It is a long-term investment in the future. I feel if you do make the most of your time at university, it is good value for money. just as with students calculating the long-term value of investing in higher education, so politicians must work out the value to the nation of having a well-resourced university sector. Mark Easton, BBC News, at the University of Surrey. The Australian journalist Peter Greste has given his first interview since he was freed after more than 400 days injail in Egypt. He described his release as like a ‘rebirth’. He was found guilty last year of helping the banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation. He’s now on his way back to Australia but says he feels incredible ‘angst’ about his two colleagues still in jail. Our Cairo correspondent, Orla Guerin reports. joy and relief written on the faces of the Greste family. They have said they can’t stop smiling. Soon, they’ll be reunited with the son and brother who was finally free. In his first interview, Peter Greste has spoken about the moment he discovered his nightmare was ending. The prison warden called me over and told me that, ""It’s time to pack your stuff."" I said, ""What do you mean?"" He said, ""You’re going."" Isaid, ""Well, where? To another prison?"" He said, ""No, no, no. The Embassy’s coming, they’ll be here in an hour, get your stuff and go."" And I can’t tell you that real mix of emotions that was boiling inside. His happiness tempered by anxiety about Mohammad Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, his colleagues who are still behind bars. Amidst all of this relief I still feel a sense of concern, a real sense of worry, because if it’s appropriate for me, if it’s right for me to be free, then it’s right for all of them to be free. journalists in Egypt can risk their lives as well as their freedom. These murals honour some of those killed on the job. While the Al-jazeera case has generated huge interest abroad, there are otherjournalists injail in Egypt getting little or no attention. The journalists’ union here says nearly 20 reporters and photographers remain behind bars. They’re all Egyptians and relatives fear that without foreign pressure, they could be forgotten. As Peter Greste celebrates his freedom, the judge who jailed him issued another verdict today. He confirmed death sentences for 183 men convicted of killing policemen during Islamist riots. Critics say, once again, Egyptianjustice is in the dock. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Cairo. A record number of complaints have been made against police in England and Wales. Figures show there were almost 35,000 cases involving grievances in 2013 to 2014 - the highest number since the Independent Police Commission was set up more than a decade ago. More than half of the allegations involved claims that officers were rude and had neglected or failed in their duty. The widow of the former spy Alexander Litvinenko has started giving evidence at the inquiry into his death. Marina Litvinenko claimed that her husband’s death in London in 2006 of radiation poisoning was ordered by the Kremlin. Our Security Correspondent, Gordon Corera, was at the inquiry.

A former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, died of radioactive polonium poisoning in a London hospital. Pointing the figure of blame at the Kremlin. Today, we learnt he joined the KGB, Russia’s secret police, in the final years of the Cold War. Later, it was renamed the FSB and he became part of an anti-terrorist unit. In 1994, an insurgency began in Chechnya. Her husband nextjoined the specialist team investigating organised crime. Here he met businessman and politician, Boris Berezovsky. Some of his fellow officers asked him something highly unusual. Speaking in the inquiry today, Marina said, ""Fellow FSB officers had asked her husband, regarding Berezovsky, you know him well, would you kill him?"" Litvinenko’s anger at corruption in the FSB led him to speak out. The man who was head of the FSB and whom Litvinenko had complained to in person was Vladimir Putin. After that press conference, Alexander Litvinenko told his wife he might be killed. Soon after they fled to Britain. When he arrived at Heathrow Airport he told a policeman he was a member of the KGB and wanted political asylum. member of the KGB and wanted politicalasylum. In London, he became a vocal critic of Vladimir Putin. The inquiry heard he accused Mr Putin of orchestrating this bombing of apartments in Moscow to justify his rise to power. Marina Litvinenko today confirmed her husband began consulting for MI6 after he arrived in the UK. She said he received £2,000 a month paid direct into his bank account. Tomorrow, the inquiry will hear further evidence from Marina Litvinenko as well as from her son. Gordon Corera, BBC News, at the Royal Courts ofjustice.

The first large-scale trials of an experimental vaccine against Ebola have begun in Liberia, one of the countries worst affected by the current outbreak, which has killed nearly 9,000 people. Today the first of up to 30,000 volunteers were given the trial vaccines produced by the companies, GSK and Merck. Mark Doyle reports from the Liberian capital Monrovia.

At one point last year there were fears that a bowler might spread from West Africa throughout the world. -- might spread from West Africa throughout the world. -- Ebola. Today, a Liberian man led the way in what may be part of a solution. I am the first person to take it. You are number one? Iam number one. I wanted to be in the lead. just as important is sharing information with the local population. These community health workers will track the volunteers who have been vaccinated, monitoring their health, trying to build trust. The way this vaccine works is that they introduce into the body a tiny bit of the Ebola virus. The key thing the doctors say here is that tiny -- tiny bit of the virus tricks the body into thinking it can fight against Ebola. Nurses dressed in full protective gear still treat Ebola patient in Liberia. The number of cases has now dropped considerably. Forthese of cases has now dropped considerably. For these scientists, including the most Liberian senior involved, there is now some hope. A small country on the West Coast of Africa is making a difference in terms of making a significant contribution to global health. The fall in the number of cases is undoubtedly good news. Parts of the largest Ebola treatment centre in the world are being pulled down and burned. If the trial goes well, it may well be possible to say that the end of West Africa’s Ebola nightmare is in sight. Mark Doyle, BBC News, Liberia. A second UK military healthcare worker has been flown back to England following ""likely exposure"" to the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone. The patient has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in north London, where the other health worker, flown back on Saturday, is also being assessed. The first paramedic to reach the casualties of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 has been giving evidence at the inquest in Warrington. Tony Edwards was crewing a South Yorkshire ambulance on the day of the tragedy, when 96 fans died at the stadium. Danjohnson is in Warrington. Yes, today Tony Edwards was very critical of the response to the Hillsborough disaster. He told the iury Hillsborough disaster. He told the jury at the inquests that senior officers did not seem to be in control, and he was surprised and concerned that there was not systematic assessment of the casualties. He explained that at first he had not been able to get his ambulance under the pitch. A police officer had told him he could not go on because fans were still fighting. It was a senior ambulance officer who told him to ignore the instruction, to put the sirens on and headed towards the terrace. The iury and headed towards the terrace. The jury saw a video today which showed the ambulance making its way through the crowd before Tony Edwards got out of it. He said he was looking for a senior ambulance officer who could direct him and help them to prioritise the casualties. He said there was nobody there taking control and he could not cope on his own. He said when he tried to put injured fans into the ambulance, others had opened the doors and were trying to get in. When asked what he thought of all of the response, he said, there was no response, it was just me. Passengers on a London bus have had a lucky escape when its roof was ripped off after it hit a tree. Two people were taken to hospital with facial injuries and two others were treated for minor injuries, after the Number 91 bus clipped an overhanging tree on Kingsway in Central London. It sent the roof crashing into the road behind it. Transport for London says there will be a full investigation. Labour has pledged to give Scotland more devolved power if it wins the General Election. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the Scottish labour leader jim Murphy outlined their plans in Edinburgh, saying it would mean Scotland could pay higher pensions and benefits if the Scottish parliament could find the money to do so. But the SNP said the opinion polls were causing Labour to panic. Laura Bicker reports. Can this Labourline-up Can this Labour line-up save the party from defeat in Scotland? The former Prime Minister is back on the campaign trail. Once again he is talking about more powers for the Scottish parliament. This time he says his party will go further than ever before. I tell you, with the powers we are talking about today, the Scottish parliament will not be powerless to act on jobs, to act on the housing crisis. It will not be powerless to act on youth unemployment. And no longer could the SMB practice this blame game that some videos is to blame and not them. -- that some videos is to blame and not them. -- SNP. Polls suggest Labour is losing votes to the SNP. The owner of this shop used to vote Labour but felt betrayed by the party and Gordon Brown. It is as if somebody is pulling his strings, sending him to Scotland. You go and persuade them, basically. It is not going to work this time. Her customers are also confused about the Labour Party officer. They have lost their way, I think. The the Labour Party officer. They have lost their way, Ithink. The people that supported them the most. I would like to see Labour becoming more left wing. Labour hoax to tempt people to more powers to Scotland. -- hoax. And handing over full control of housing benefit. I think what it demonstrates is the panic within the Labour Party at the rise of the Scottish National Party and the panic they face in advance of the Westminster election. If people in Scotland want to be guaranteed that we can have a powerhouse parliament in Scotland, they have got to vote SNP to have SMP is who will deliver for Scotland and Westminster. The Independence Referendum focused minds on Scotland -- in Scotland on what a vote in May might mean forthem. -- in Scotland on what a vote in May might mean for them. This has been a sales pitch aimed at Labour voters who voted yes in the referendum. Will it be enough? They only have three months to find out. Laura Bicker, BBC News, Edinburgh. Smoking has already been banned in pubs and there are plans to outlaw it in cars. Now smokers in Bristol are also being asked to stub out their cigarettes in some outdoor public spaces. The trial scheme involves two squares in the city centre popular with families. jon Kay reports. Bristol today. Could this be your street tomorrow? The first signs asking us not to light up in public spaces. Among the smokers we found, defiance. Absolutely not. I am aware of the risks. I would advise any children not to give up but it will not stop me from smoking. Had you noticed it? No. Not at all. That explains why I have got a cigarette in my hand. Are you going to stop? No. This is a pilot scheme affecting two public areas. The organisers admit it is not a banned. They will not be issuing tickets or finds. This is a voluntary measure. We are politely asking people not to smoke in this area. What was the point? The point is it does work. If you pollute -- The point is it does work. If you pollute -- politely ask people not to smoke in public areas, many people would do that. Other areas have introduced smoke-free parks and playgrounds. This is the most ambitious scheme so far. It is interesting that Bristol is trying to lead the way in the battle against smoking when you consider its historic links with cigarettes. For hundreds of years tobacco was brought to Bristol by boat and rolled and sold from the city’s factories. Nonsmokers seemed to welcome the new scheme. The smell is offensive. She has got a cold at the moment and when she walks through a cloud of smoke it comes out on her chest. You have to start somewhere. Hopefully little steps will lead to one big one. New laws in Toronto and Hong Kong have similar schemes. Other UK cities are watching closely. jon Kay, Bristol. Two bronze statues dismissed for more than a century as minor sculptures, could in fact be the work of Michelango. The pair were identified from a tiny detail in a drawing which is 500 years old. If the claim proves accurate they would be the only surviving Michelango bronzes in the world. Will Gompertz reports. Two idealised naked male figures sit astride a couple of snarling Panthers. The modelling is superb. The compositions elegant. These are bronze sculptures of the highest quality. But who did them? Art historians have been arguing about that for more than 100 years. No longer, maybe. Academics at Cambridge University think they have found the answer. We have got some fantastic new Michelangelos which we firmly believe on evidence, visual, technical and anatomical, we believe to be early works by Michelangelo. That means the 30-year-old Michelangelo would have produced them after carving his sculpture of David Button before painting the Sistine Chapel. -- David Button before painting the Sistine Chapel. -- but before. To say these are pieces by Michelangelo is a big and significant claim. It would make them the only two known sculptures in the world by the great Renaissance master. So what is there evidence? This is exhibiting a, a drawing that happened upon, showing a male figure on a panther. It is not by Michelangelo but it is a direct copy from him. Then there are the stylistic similarities between the way Michelangelo depicted certain physical details in his marble carvings, the anatomical accuracy and the evidence of both. Finally, there is the appliance of science, where specialist x-rays were taken dating the work back to when they say. What tends to happen is either fairly, almost surprisingly quickly, they are accepted as the great canon of art. Or they are equally swiftly forgotten and three minutes later nobody remembers them. If they are by Michelangelo, their value would well above the £1.8 a private collector, reportedly paid for them in 2002. -- collector, reportedly paid for them in 2002. -- one 8p. And a new chapter would open on the extraordinary legacy of a great Italian artists. Time for a look at the weather with Matt Taylor. Hello. We stay with the chilly conditions. Night to come for some of you. We may see some further snow showers fall. Sleet and snow developing in Northern Ireland, northern Scotland and Eastern counties of England. We could see a dusting of snow into the morning. A widespread frost. Coldest conditions from West and Wales into the East of Scotland, some as low as -10 or -11 degrees. Across eastern England from North Yorkshire towards Kent and Sussex could wake up to a slight dusting of snow. Very much hit and miss. West of Lincolnshire, we have lost the showers we had today. A very icy start. A sharp frost in eastern Wales into north-west England. North of Scotland we will see sleet and snow developments again. Across central and western areas of Northern Ireland, too. That will gradually ease through the day. We will continue to see snow flurries in Eastern counties of England. Turning more to sleet. Very much hit and miss. Some of you will not see any snow at all. Towards the West, drierthan not see any snow at all. Towards the West, drier than today. But cold as well. It will feel cold in the South and South East.

Someone across London, perhaps here at Hillingdon Hospital, there has just been a record-breaking breath. The capital now has more people than ever. This baby hasjust become one of them. You’re a lovely little baby. It is hearing Hillingdon where the population has grown most since 1939, an 80% rise, 130,000 more people. The capital is shifting outputs, pushing up against the green belt, out of the slums, into the suburbs. London as a whole has grown steadily since the 1980s, when a new post-industrial economy took shape around finance and the city. The change was really the growth of employment. London had lost1 million manufacturing jobs over 50 years, and it was when office and service sector employment started to grow again, and offices were built in southern London, thosejobs due people back in, and that was the triggerfor London to people back in, and that was the trigger for London to grow again. Those million manufacturing jobs have been replaced by1 million service sector jobs. The capital service sectorjobs. The capital is now growing at the rate of 2000 people per week. London’s rebirthing growth could not have happened without migration and immigration, but more people are coming from the rest of the UK then I coming from other countries in the world. A biggerfactor in the world. A bigger factor in the growth, actually, is birth. More people are being born than are dying in London, partly because it is a young city, but there has been a big surge in births, and that is the most immediate cause of London’s population growth. It is in Tower Hamlets where the population is growing fastest. There seems to be a lot of tailoring industries, manufacturing industries in this area. First the huge nose, then the jews, then Bengalis in the 70s, and now new settlers. You have quite young, rich, affluent people moving in, communities mingling together, and it has been a really exciting time, but also, new waves of immigration, like people say, the hipsters and the trendy community coming into the area, but also people who settle in here from Eastern Europe and other places as well. It is a wonderful, rich area of all different communities mixing together, which is quite exciting. Backin together, which is quite exciting. Back in Hillingdon, they are now seeing more younger families settling, more children needing schools. But has the rate of new arrivals caught us unprepared? Like, not enough midwives? We may not have predicted as many births as indeed we have had, so it does take a view years to train up midwives. London’s population may now officially be the biggest it has ever been, but it certainly hasn’t peaked. It is set to keep on growing and growing. What will that mean for the capital’s infrastructure, its education, transport, housing? Not just in the short-term, but in the decades to come? Well, with me to talk about some of those issues is Professor Michael Batty from University College London, an expert in population growth. Good evening to you. The biggest population it has ever been, and as Tim said, set to keep growing. If things like housing, health care and transport are struggling now, that is potentially a huge impact on infrastructure and services, isn’t it? Yes, a massive impact. There are probably 50,000 people coming in each year. That is net immigration from outside of Britain, and all of this has TB catered for in terms of demand on public services. It is interesting you touched on immigration there, because when you think of population growth, the perception is often that it is mainly down to immigration, but we heard there that the biggest factor is births and also more people coming to London from the rest of the UK. That’s right. The biggest numbers are coming from the rest of the UK, about 200,000 per year, and there are about 200,000 immigrants coming in. But 250,000 are leaving London each year, so we are losing 30,000 people, Londoners, basically, to the rest of the country, and the shortfall, of course, is made up again by immigrants, in that sense. The increasing fertility and ageing are making an impact. I think if we added another 25,000 per year, that would take is to 75,000, and then we would be talking about 10.2 million in 2039. Do you get a sense we are prepared for this? Well, Do you get a sense we are prepared forthis? Well, Ithink Do you get a sense we are prepared for this? Well, I think one of the basic problems is that the detailed numbers are very difficult to work out. Traditionally, migrants tend to be younger people, so they probably put less demands on public services, but the increases are very substantial, and the various agencies find it very hard to deal with, in terms of projections. Really, we know that housing is one of the biggest issues in London, and in the past, we shifted outputs, but of course, that is not sustainable, so we either encroach on the green belt or build upwards, is already happening? our skyline has changed incredibly over the years. What is your view on that? I think both of those things. The biggest problem of bringing people in from beyond the green belt into Londoners transport costs, prices are clearly a bit cheaper. The whole transport cost and housing prices are very problematic in London, and this could be the big damper on population growth. It could restrict these big numbers that we have seen in the last ten years. Interesting. Professor Michael Batty, thanks for your views this evening. We will be touching on some of those issues later on in the week. And continuing our series Crowded Capital, tomorrow we’ll be looking at some of the creative solutions London schools are coming up with to deal with the increase in pupil numbers. To find out more about the capital’s population, past, present and future, just go to our website, where we’ve plenty of London facts and figures. Coming up later in the programme: The charities stepping in to feed the capital’s youngsters as doctors warn of an increase in malnutrition-related hospital admissions. Five people have been injured after a bus crashed into a tree in central London this lunchtime, ripping off the double-decker’s roof. London Ambulance say it was a miracle no-one was more seriously hurt. Lets get more from Alice Bhandhukravi, who’s in Holborn. That’s right. This is where the incident happened. You will see behind being a sign which clearly says, overhanging trees, warning to buses, low trees. Behind me, the tree in question, with some Bach missing, which is where the point of impact presumably happened. Emergency services were called here today at just after one o’clock, a busy time in Harborne, and they found the 91 bus here with its roof ripped clean off. -- found the 91 bus here with its roof ripped clean off. -- in Holborn. The roof was lying in the road, and the southbound road was entirely closed to traffic. It was, by all accounts, a shocking scene for people out on their lunch breaks. I managed to speak to one eyewitness, who described the scene. As I was leaving uni, I had a pretty loud screeching sound, and I saw the roof of the bus had fallen off the back. People were just sitting there, looking pretty taken aback. The first thing you think, maybe a bomb has gone off or something. There was a lot of shattered glass everywhere, people sitting on the top deck looking pretty is a prize. But yes, then the police came a few minutes later,. But for a couple of minutes, it was very scary. Five people were treated for their injuries. Two had to be treated for what we believe to be facial injuries. An investigation is underway for what actually happened, but CFL has also confirmed that they are looking into whether a design flaw could have contributed to the roof actually being ripped off this bus. -- TfL. The Mayor of Tower Hamlets stood accused of electoral fraud today, as a special court heard claims of corrupt and illegal practices at the east London council. For the local people are claiming postal ballot forms were rigged, and voters believe that polling stations. The court’s hearing a petition by four local people who want the mayoral race in the borough re-run. Barristers for Mayor Lutfur Rahman dismissed the allegations as ""hysteria and myth"". Our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer. His supporters cheered when he won the election last mayor, but the election last May, but Lutfur Rahman’s battle for control in Tower Hamlets is far from over. Today, more than eight months after voters went to the polls, the Tower Hamlets result was being questioned in the High Court. A petition brought by these three local people and one other, alleging fraud and voter intimidation. We feel determined to ask for a further election, and also for Mr Rahman to be banned from office for a period of five years. That is our objective. But our main objective is to make sure that we restore democracy to Tower Hamlets. The court heard allegations that people were bullied at polling stations, that postal votes were fraudulently filled in, and that grants were given to groups likely to support Lutfur Rahman. All claims were strongly denied. Barristers on both sides traded blows, Duncan Penny for the mayor, Francis Hoar speaking for the election petitioners about Lutfur Rahman. He managed to bribe, to intimidate and to defraud ~ I think it is politically motivated. I think some of the political establishment cannot except that now Rahman has won the election fairly and freely. First they said an independent could not win, then they said the turnout was low, and we proved them wrong on both of those occasions. The petitioners have lodged their petition, they have made complaints, and I think I can bring to bear some evidence about what I feel happened at the election. I think I have a duty to do that. Secondly, because very personally, allegations were made about me and mY allegations were made about me and my conduct, and I need to defend myself. Tomorrow, Labour’sjohn myself. Tomorrow, Labour’s john Biggs Tomorrow, Labour’sjohn Biggs will give evidence, the first of what is expected to be over a hundred witnesses. The trial could last anything up to two months. London’s Air Ambulance says it is in urgent need of a second medical helicopter. The charity is launching an appeal to raise £4 million, insisting that another aircraft is crucial in ensuring London has COI’ItiI’IUOUS COVEI’. Last year, the Air Ambulance treated more than 1,800 patients in the capital. It’s set to become a familiar sight at Tube stations across the capital. Today the first ticket offices closed at Wimbledon and Queensway, with controversial plans by the Mayor to close all of them by April next year. A move designed to save £50 million pounds a year, but one million a year, but one that’s been criticised by unions. Let’sjoin our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards. Yes, a lots of tourists use this station here, and at the moment, it is relatively quiet. Today, it also lost its ticket offices. Put your card in there. This is the future of the tube. These are the tickets, and this is your receipt. There were some queues at the ticket machines as morning, as Queensway station lost its booking offices. It’s better with one person, I think. So you prefer the ticket offices? of course. Doesn’t make any difference? It is the same for me. Why do we keep the ticket office is open to give people the sense of safety? These closures are controversial. Borisjohnson initially oppose them, but then changed his mind. Last year, the changes lead to strikes. It will mean around 900 voluntary redundancies, saving £50 million a year. But the plan will cost around 135 million this year. The reality is, we are told the population of London is going to continue to grow and passenger numbers will increase. That is all great news. But Transport for London has then tried to run a service with less staff. Safety will suffer as a consequence of this. I think the number of stations in outer London which will have one member of staff now is very large, and I think it is a concern, not just for many passengers, but also for staff themselves, who might feel anxious about being alone. I think itjust also makes anxious about being alone. I think it just also makes the system anxious about being alone. I think itjust also makes the system less resilient. Removing ticket offices does free up retail space, Removing ticket offices does free up retailspace, but retail space, but here, though, there will be more ticket machines. Here, they want staff out from behind the screens, has very few bars and is used ticket offices. We’re responding to technology and a need for customers to have more visible station staff, things like contactless payment has also revolutionise the way that people use the cheap, the Oyster card, which we have had for ten years. So if we can do this, save me improve customer services bring in technology, to the riding to do put the tube in a long term. Eight more stations will lose their ticket offices this month. just the start of big changes that are going at on the Underground. -- start of big changes that are going at on the Underground. -- going ahead. It is very difficult to see how the opponents of this plan can now make an impact. All to get others is across the network idea to close in 2016. Thank you very much. Still to come: It’s transfer deadline day in football. We look at the big money deals involving the capital’s clubs. And brought together for the first time: All four surviving original copies of Magna Carta go on display at the British Library. Next: The alarming number of children in the capital suffering from malnutrition. With around 600,000 children living below the poverty line, a leading paediatrician has told us that the number of malnutrition-related hospital admissions for under-16s is rising. Well, to help tackle the problem, one charity is supporting schools to help give pupils a better start to the day. Our Education Reporter Marc Ashdown has more. Single mum Alison lives in Hackney with her two children. Food is low down their priority list. I don’t like being harassed to pay bills, so the bills are more of a priority, and then the food comes last. The kids will eat food, and I won’t eat. London has seven out of the ten poorest boroughs in the country, and in these areas, as many as one in two children are going hungry. It has been particularly recognised in schools. Come ten o’clock, pupils will say, I am hungry, orthey will Come ten o’clock, pupils will say, I am hungry, or they will be falling asleep, or saying that Tommy was rumbling, and that they will be losing concentration, slouching, and you ask what is wrong, and eventually, they will say, I mist breakfast this morning, I haven’t had anything to eat. This school in Edmonton is one of 170 being helped by a charity that offers reckless to all the kids. Before they started doing this school, what would have? Would you have breakfast at home? Probably not. I would probably have breakfast at home? Probably not. Iwould probablyjust not. I would probablyjust have a hot drink and go to school. This morning, I was busy, sol hot drink and go to school. This morning, I was busy, so I had breakfast now. Not at home? No. London is the food poverty capital of the country. We are really noticing that children are lacking in concentration, they are lethargic, some children are thinking with malnutrition in the classroom. This paediatrician knows only too well how crucial the early years are for development. Recently, he has seen the number of malnutrition related hospital admissions and under 16 ‘s increase. Perhaps the most common is Ricketts, and the problem in babies of seizures from low calcium, the governor is not enough vitamin de in our mothers, and in their children they are going. So for us, that is dramatic. It is something we did not see much of only 1980s and 90s, now we are seeing cases regularly. With 3000 more children in the UK expected to be living in poverty by next year, this is not something the government can afford to ignore. And you can see Marc’s full report later tonight on Inside Out London at 7:30 here on BBC One. It’s transfer deadline day for football clubs, which means they have until 11 o’clock tonight to buy and sell players before business closes until the summer. Our sports reporter Chris Slegg is here with news of the big deals affecting London teams. What have you got? The biggest deal, as you might expect, involves Chelsea, because in the last ten minutes, it has been confirmed they have signed a Colombian international midfielder. He was really impressive at the World Cup last summer. He hasjoined really impressive at the World Cup last summer. He has joined for a fee believed to be £23.3 million. This being the year of the Financial Fair Play rules, even a club as rich as Chelsea cannot spend limitless live. They have had to sell a player, the German international World Cup winner. He put in some impressive performances of the Chelsea player, so some fans will be sorry to see him go, but I think most will be excited I be prospect of their new player. Unfair to say, transfer deadline day can make or break a team’s season? -- and there? Yes, last year, Crystal Palace meeting key signings and managed to stay in the Premier League. Today, they have had significant news that Wilfred Saha looks close to signing a permanent deal to stay forfive and a to signing a permanent deal to stay for five and a half years. He to signing a permanent deal to stay forfive and a half years. He has been on loan for most of the past year from Manchester United. been on loan for most of the past yearfrom Manchester United. It year from Manchester United. It is a case of him coming back home, really, because he started at Crystal Palace, left two years ago for Manchester united, and failed to settle there. He has looked far more at home at Selhurst Park. Still only 22, his best days are ahead of him. What else could happen before 11 o’clock tonight? We are keeping a close eye on Emmanuel Adebayor, the Tottenham striker, who has fallen out of favour at White Hart Lane. West Ham enquired Ellie about the potential of signing him, initially on loan. That deal appears to have stalled. There has been talk that his former manager Harry Redknapp and QPR might look to take him to Loftus Road. Nothing firm on that today, but if there will be another big move before 11 o’clock tonight, it could well involve added by all. For now, thank you very much. Written in 1215, the Magna Carta laid the foundations for democracy in Britain and established the principle that nobody is above the law. Now, to mark 800 years since its creation, the four remaining original versions are being brought together for the first time at the British Library. Nick Higham has the story. And so on Cathedral, a glorious example of the beauty and splendour of the Middle Ages. -- example of the beauty and splendour of the Middle Ages. -- Salisbury Cathedral. This is one of the cathedral’s greatest treasures, a reminder of the grubbier side of medieval politics, the official record of a deal thrashed out between King john and his rebellious barons. At the British library today, all four of the surviving original copies of Magna Carta brought together for the first time ever. This is an extraordinary moment, to find these documents, which aren’t just about historical narrative, they are about the very essence of who we are as a people. Magna Carta was agreed between the king and his most powerful subject here at Runnymede near Windsor. To later generations, it was a seminal moment for the English, and indeed, for Americans, who put up this monument. What was agreed he still matters, because it was Magna Carta that established the principle but even rulers are not above the law, and you can’t take a man’s property or liberty away from him without a proper trial. But to contemporaries, set at the King’s arbitrary rule and high taxes, it was simply a peace treaty designed to head off Civil War. It failed, incidentally. It is now thought there were 13 official copies sent out of the bishops, not, as once thought, to the county sheriffs who were appointed by the king. The last thing we barons in 1215 wanted to do with this send charters to the Sheraton counties, because they were the very people under attack. If you send them to the sheriff, it is going to disappear into his castle, into his fairness, and it will never be seen again. The British library has many ministers and medieval money Scott’s on display. Magna Carta is rather less impressive. Today, the media were invited to admire for remarkable pieces of history. Tomorrow, the Turnerjust pieces of history. Tomorrow, the Turner just 1215 Turnerjust 1215 members of the public. -- the turn of. Let’s get a check on this week’s weather with Georgina Burnett. You are going to say cold, I knew? That’s pretty much sums it up! We have a shift from north-westerly to north-easterly over the next few days, a gradual shift, but we are likely to see some more action in the way of snow, and the freezing temperatures continue overnight, called by day as well. There is a warning for Wednesday, which I will tell you about in a minute. After quite a bright day, we have clear skies to start up this evening. You can see this cloud syncing down from the north-east, bringing a few light snow showers. Temperatures getting down to -2 minus three degrees, so even weather is no snow, likely to be a widespread frost. A frosty, cloudy start to tomorrow. We have temperatures not really getting too high through the day, but you can see that wind gradually shifting around to a northerly direction, so feeling quite fresh in the win, but it does brighten up by the afternoon. We will see Sunny spells as well. Always the chance of a snow shower, and of course, we weren’t all see those. Temperatures getting to about three or 4 degrees. I mentioned that morning. That is for Wednesday, a yellow warning for snow for London and the surrounding counties. It is for the whole day. It is likely on higher ground we will see a few centimetres, perhaps in the Chilterns, just one or two centimetres lower ground. But we must be aware there is the potential for disruption to our day. On Wednesday, fairly cloudy generally. Not until the afternoon do we start to see there is snow showers, and of course, not all of us will see those anyway. But they continued through the night and into Thursday. They are starting to die out on Thursday, and it is pretty windy as well. A north-easterly wind.

Now the main headlines: The Prime Minister has promised to protect school funding in England after the next election - IF they win. David Cameron said rising pupil numbers would mean each school received more money. But Labour claims it amounts to a spending cut as it doesn’t take inflation into account. The widow of the former spy Alexander Litvinenko begun giving evidence into the investigation into his death. She claimed that his radiation poisoning in 2006 was ordered by the Kremlin. The roof of a double decker bus has been ripped off after it collided with a tree in Holborn. London Ambulance Service said passengers had a lucky escape, with only two people taken to hospital with facial injuries. And the capital’s population is the highest it’s ever been, exceeding the peak first reached more than 75 years ago. Official figures predict there are around 8.6 million people living in London, set to rise to 10.2 million by the year 2039. That’s it, thanks forjoining us.

31,BBC1 London,2-feb-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten: David Cameron says he’ll protect school spending in England, but not in line with inflation. He says a future Conservative Government would maintain the schools budget, in cash terms. Labour says it’s a hollow pledge. The policy would represent a change compared with the past five years, and the Prime Minister acknowledged it would be a challenge. I accept that is a difficult decision for some schools because the amount of cash per child is not going up by inflation. The amount of cash is staying the same. We’ll be asking what the policy would mean for schools and the decisions they’d have to take. Also tonight. The new Greek Finance Minister tells the BBC he’s optimistic about reaching agreement with international creditors.

And could these be the only known surviving bronzes by Later on BBC London: The capital is the biggest it’s ever been. 8.6 million people and rising. And a bus’s roof is ripped off in Holborn. Five people escape with minor injuries. Good evening. David Cameron says he would change the way England’s schools are funded if the Conservatives won the next election. He would protect spending on state schools, but admitted that funding per child would not keep pace with inflation. The Prime Minister acknowledged this would be a difficult decision for some schools but he said the Government had demonstrated that 'more could be achieved with less’. Labour said the ‘cat was out of the bag,' as our political editor, Nick Robinson, reports. Ta-dah! And there you have it! David Cameron’s new election promise to protect spending on English schools. But hold on, is this Conservative commitment really as generous as it might at first appear? We have demonstrated in the past five years that we can protect the schools’ budget while reducing the deficit and we will do so again. So, I can tell you, with the Conservative Government, the amount of money following your child into the school, that will not be cut. In Treasury speak, flat cash per pupil. Can we just translate ""flat cash""? Anybody doing economics at this school knows that means a cut in real terms. It means money does not keep pace with inflation? What it means is the cash sum that follows your child into the school will not be cut. Maybe. But if prices do go up, the amount spent per pupil will not keep pace. The budget a school has might go up, though, simply because the number of pupils they take looks set to increase. I accept that is a difficult decision for some schools. The amount of cash per child is not going up by inflation. The amount of cash is staying the same. It is already difficult in some schools, particularly those like Southend High, a successful grammar school. It doesn’t benefit from those big top-up payments called the pupil premium, which are given to schools which take a lot of kids from deprived homes. The Head is campaigning for David Cameron to think again. His budget deficit next year looks to be around £250,000. It is the schools that are quiet, effective, efficient deliverers of superb outcomes that are in a position of where they can’t break even. His pupils say they are feeling the squeeze. We don’t have the money to function as a school. We can keep the lights on, but that’s about it. In lessons, if there’s hand-outs to be given out, sorry, there’s not enough for one each because of the printing costs. A3 paper is like gold dust. Only a few weeks ago, Tory Ministers were advised to dodge questions on school spending. Their briefing paper told them to say, ""Of course, there will be difficult decisions in the education budget in the next Parliament."" What does that mean? For schools as a whole, it looks like it is roughly like a real-terms freeze. The real amount of resources per pupil will go down. Actually, over this Parliament, that hasn’t gone down. Labour say the cat is out of the bag. But they won’t yet spell out what they’d spend. Do Labour promise to go further? Will there be real-terms increases in schools’ budgets? The Labour Party has always supported our education system and an Ed Miliband Government would continue to do so. We will set out that in the run-up to the General Election. The Lib Dems say they are committed to protecting the whole education budget. This will mean a real-terms squeeze on schools, which they have not experienced in this Parliament because the Liberal Democrats insisted on protecting the schools’ budget, but if the Conservatives ended up governing by themselves, it would be a bad time for schools. There was no drum roll but David Cameron clearly thought it was a big deal that he promised to protect spending on every pupil in England’s schools. What he didn’t do is promise to protect it from inflation. He didn’t promise to protect the rest of the education budget. And he certainly can’t promise to protect the rest of public spending from bigger cuts that will have to be made as a result. Nick Robinson, BBC News, Enfield, North London. Our education correspondent Alex Forsyth is at Westminster. Nick’s last point about the practical implications if this policy was enforced. How do you read it? Well, school funding is a complex thing. The amount each school gets varies, depending on factors such as the level of need of their pupils or where they are in the country. Some are better or worse off than others. Some schools are already struggling financially, despite the fact spending has been protected over the past five years. From next year, they’ll have to find extra money for increased pension contributions for teachers, for a change in national insurance and today there was no promise to protect early years funding. For those nursery pupils or post A level funding or colleges. The Conservatives said the announcement shows their commitment to education, it is a real priority. David Cameron would have hoped for a warm reception for this promise to protect school spending in cash terms. In reality, there’ll be a lot of disappointed head teachers who will face a lot of difficult decisions about spending. The newly-appointed Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has told the BBC he’s optimistic that an understanding can be reached with Greece’s international creditors. Mr Varoufakis, who’s been meeting key financial figures in London today, has discussed the possibility of restructuring his country’s debts. He spoke to our economics editor, Robert Peston, after the talks ended. Was the meeting successful Yes, it was. Greece’s new Finance Minister arriving at a hotel in Park Lane. So for 90 minutes the Greek Finance Minister spoke to a couple of hundred investors, bankers those who have lent to Greece. He explained to them how he hopes to save his country from collapse. What reassurance were you able to give your creditors that their debt will be repaid? This is the strange kind of alliance that we are forging here tonight between a left-wing Government and the financial sector. Odd-bedfellows in the middle of a depression. These are the times we live in. It’s an alliance that makes perfect sense. When you are in a debt-deflationary cycle, putting an end to it both benefits the population, brings it out of the collapses of increasing misery and hopelessness and increases equity. So, my meeting with the private investors here in London tonight gave both sides, them and me, a great deal of optimism about the future. The fact we are constantly in the headlines... Britain is not in the eurozone, of course. Mr Varoufakis called in for a cup of tea with the Chancellor today, because he believes the British Government shares his view that the bailout deal imposed by Germany and the IMF is unsustainable. It is clear that the standoff between Greece and the eurozone is fast becoming the biggest risk to the global economy. It is a rising threat to our economy at home. In Europe, as in Britain, now is the time to choose competence over chaos. I urge the Greek Finance Minister to act responsibly. The greatest immediate problem is that billions are being withdrawn from its banks on the fear that the country will be forced out of the eurozone, which Mr Varoufakis says he wants to avoid. Do you think that your city audience understood your message that debt cannot be repaid without growth? I came to this meeting, asl cannot be repaid without growth? I came to this meeting, as I actually come to meetings with my colleagues in various capitals, my counterparts, Finance Ministers w a left-wing heart and a narrative which could come out of a bankruptcy lawyer’s textbook. After the meeting I spoke to the creditors and they largely agreed that Greece does need more financial help, especially from the eurozone’s biggest economy, Germany, but they are not betting Angela Merkel will stump up. The Australian journalist Peter Greste says he is relieved to be free, but feels ‘incredible angst’ having left behind two colleagues injail in Egypt. Mr Greste, who works for Al-jazeera, was freed from prison and deported yesterday after being held for 400 days. He and Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were arrested in 2013 on charges of spreading false news and aiding the banned organisation the Muslim Brotherhood. Our Cairo correspondent orla Guerin reports. After a year behind bars with his Aljazeera colleagues, Peter Greste can now look forward to covering news, not making it, and to being reunited with his family. In his first interview, he explained how the nightmare ended. The prison warden called me over and told me that, you know, it’s time to pack your stuff. I said, what do you mean? You’re going. Where? To another prison? No, the embassy is coming. They will be here in an hour. Get your stuff and go. And I can’t tell you that real mix of emotions that were boiling inside. His happiness was tempered by anxiety about producers Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who are still prisoners. Amidst all of this relief, I still feel a sense of concern and a real sense of worry, because if it’s right for me to be free, then it’s right for all of them to be free. But his colleagues are not the only ones waiting forjustice. While the Aljazeera case has generated huge interest abroad, there are otherjournalists injail in Egypt getting little or no attention. The journalists’ union here says nearly 20 reporters and photographers remain behind bars. They are all Egyptians, and relatives fear that without foreign pressure, they could be forgotten. It seems Shokan Abu Zeid already has been. He spent 530 days injail without charge. His brother Mohammed tells me he was arrested covering the violent dispersal of a Muslim Brotherhood sit-in. He says prison is taking his health and his spirit. We expected that he might die doing hisjob, he says. We would have accepted that. But for him to die every day, that is hard for us. As Peter Greste savours freedom, the judge who jailed him has issued another verdict. Today, he confirmed death sentences for 183 men convicted of killing policemen during Islamist riots. Critics say that once again, Egyptianjustice is in the dock. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Cairo. The widow of Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian spy who died in London after drinking tea poisoned with radioactive polonium, has started giving evidence at the public inquiry into his death. Marina Litvinenko said her husband had fled to the UK because he feared he might be killed after attempting to expose corruption in the Russian security service. She also revealed that her husband was later paid a £2,000 monthly retainer by British intelligence. The recent cuts in energy bills could have been much bigger, according to the consumer group Which? It claims households should have saved an average £1lI5 last year. The research, to be published tomorrow, suggests that energy firms should now be cutting gas and electricity prices by as much as 10%. Our Industry Correspondent john Moylan has been looking at the figures. The rece nt cuts The recent cuts in energy bills could have been much In the energy world, these are turbulent times. For the past year, wholesale prices have been falling, but are households across Britain really feeling the benefit? Pensioner Richard Langdon keeps an eye on his bills. As a British Gas customer, his tariff will fall by 5% at the end of February. He thinks that is too little, too late. It has been nonsense, because wholesale prices have dropped quite a lot, and there is no reason for the industry not to drop the price for the consumer. Which? Compared how the suppliers buy energy and compared that with how much they charge all of us for it. It found that savings of £1lI5 on a standard dual fuel bill could have been passed on to households last year. That amounts to total savings of £2.9 billion across Britain. And it says there is room for further cuts to gas and electricity prices of up to 10% in the year ahead. The mismatch between wholesale energy costs and the price we all pay on our bill has been big and growing steadily. There is no excuse for any supplier not to pass through these savings to their customers, unless we have an energy market that is not working competitively. The suppliers don’t agree. They say that the energy we are using today may have been bought a few years ago. They do this to secure supplies, to keep the lights on and to shield households from volatile prices. You can’t suddenly pass the savings on in one chunk. It is only as your buying strategy unwinds and you can take advantage of these new, lower wholesale prices that you can pass those on to your customers. Do you believe that the price cuts we have seen recently really reflect what has been going on in the wholesale markets? Yes, I think that is a fair reflection. As prices are falling, as companies can afford to pass those savings on, they are doing so. The energy market is now in the midst of a major competition investigation that should tell us once and for all whether the price we pay for energy is fair. john Moylan, BBC News. The independent inquiry into historical child abuse announced seven months ago should finally take shape later this week, when the Home Secretary announces her choice of chairman. Two previous nominees have stepped aside. Survivors’ groups have condemned the process as a mess, and they’ve demanded the appointment of a more powerful body. Despite the recent prominence given to abuse cases involving high-profile public figures, experts say most abuse takes place within the home. In the first of two special reports, Fergal Keane has been talking to some of those affected. It is deeply unfair on survivors of abuse, who need to be listened to and who need justice. When will she sort this out? Hear, hear. Thank you, MrSpeaker... There is a public clamour that has reached every home in Britain. And there is the quiet pain of those unheard for years. Chris Tuck has a successful career as a health coach, after, she says, surviving a childhood of neglect, beatings, sexual molestation by a neighbour and her stepfather. It makes you feel violated. It makes you feel dirty. It makes you feel angry as well. It’s not something you go up to and say to a normal person, ""Oh, ""my daddy’s been touching me here and doing that"". It’s just not something you speak about. And unless someone asked you that question, why would you speak about it? It was when Chris had her own child that she felt compelled to speak out. It hit me then how badly I had been treated as a child. How could my parents, both of them, do what they did to us as children? I wouldn’t let anything like that happen to mine. That was when I had my breakdown. And that was when I knew I had to get myself strong and better in order to bring my children up in a way that... I wasn’t brought up. Hello, you’ve reached the support line. Are you spending time with the family over Christmas? john Bird is a listener, but with a story of his own, raped by a stranger in a park aged four and then abused by his headmaster at boarding school. But it’s a crisis in the home, he says, that is in danger of being ignored in the current debate. Often, we get calls from people saying, ""I was abused by Person X"", and unfortunately, it’s usually a man. Could be an uncle or a stepdad. And then 20 or 30 years later, that person tells Mum, and Mum can’t believe it, because Mum married this man, or, you know, trusted him as a brother. And so it rips whole families apart. This isn’t just a story about children abused in the home, because children from broken homes can also be more vulnerable to abuse by strangers. This girl from Torquay was 14 when she was groomed on social media by older men who gave her drugs, and abused her. I used to go and meet people at stupid times of night. I used to stay at their houses, and always put myself in danger, which wasn’t great. Describe to me how they would draw you in. How would they groom you? It’s the way they are. They’re so nice. They compliment you and make you feel like you are God’s gift. Theyjust make you feel like the person you want to be, and the way you want to be treated. And then you find out that really, it’s all lies, because they want to take advantage and they want something out of you. I’ve been in hospital quite a few times, just because I didn’t want to carry on. It gets to a point where everything does get on top of you. When you get to that point when you want to take your own life, what is the main thing that is on your mind? I just feel worthless all the time. I feel like there are people who do die of serious causes, and I would prefer to give them my life, because I don’t really want mine. The conditions that make children vulnerable to abuse are complex, often rooted in destructive family behaviour over generations. Addiction, poverty can all play a part. But there’s been a big cultural shift. Now, the young are being urged to break the silence that has surrounded this issue for so long. Sexual abuse is not OK. Excellent work. This awareness campaign has been taken to schools around the country and fully endorsed by the children’s parents. If you did not want them to touch you there, it is kind of like physical abuse. It is difficult to know the best thing to do. Often, children don’t understand that what is happening to them is abuse, so it is empowering them and reassuring them that they can take action to stop things happening to them. There are children here from many cultures and backgrounds. What is striking to me is the degree of openness, the frankness with which they ask questions, and the honesty of the information that they are given. To somebody who went to school in the 1960s and 1970s, that, to me, is the most striking change, and perhaps the greatest sign of hope for the future. Do you know what inappropriate means? Yeah, something that you can’t see, that’s not for your age group. All these children’s parents want them to be aware. The challenge is to reach into lives where such an instinct is absent. Fergal Keane, BBC News. Fergal Keane there with that special report. We will have the second of his reports tomorrow night. The first large-scale trials of an experimental vaccine against Ebola have begun in Liberia, one of the countries worst affected by the current outbreak. Today, the first of up to 30,000 volunteers were given the trial vaccines, which have been produced by the companies GSK and Merck. Labour has promised it would give new powers to the Scottish Parliament which could lead to higher state pensions and welfare benefits than the rest of the UK. The former prime minister Gordon Brown and Labour’s Scottish leader jim Murphy explained that the money to top up the payments would need to be raised in Scotland, but the SNP said Labour was simply in a panic ahead of the general election, as our correspondent Laura Bicker reports. Can this Labour line-up save the party from defeat in Scotland? The former Prime Minister is back on the campaign trail. Once again, he is talking about more powers for the Scottish Parliament. This time, he says his party will go further than ever before. I tell you, with the powers we are talking about today, the Scottish Parliament will not be powerless to act on jobs, to act on the housing crisis. It will not be powerless to act on youth unemployment. And no longer could the SNP practise this blame game that someone else is to blame and not them. Polls suggest Labour are losing votes to the SNP. The owner of this shop used to vote Labour, but felt betrayed by the party and Gordon Brown. It is as if somebody is pulling his strings, sending him to Scotland. You go and persuade them, basically. It is not going to work this time. Labour is offering to devolve a mix of powers. It is still not a sweet enough deal for some. They have lost their way, I think. The people that supported them the most. I would like to see Labour becoming more left wing. I think what it demonstrates is the panic within the Labour Party at the rise of the Scottish National Party, and the panic they face in advance of the Westminster election. The independence referendum focused minds in Scotland on what a vote in May might mean for them. Labour are now trying to speak with a distinctive Scottish voice, but will it be enough to make those voters listen? Laura Bicker, BBC News, Edinburgh. Two bronze statues long considered to be works by minor sculptors are now thought to be by Michelangelo. Experts were alerted to a tiny detail in a 500-year-old drawing which bears a striking resemblance to the bronze pair. If the finding is verified, they are the only known surviving bronzes by Michelangelo anywhere in the world. Our arts editor Will Gompertz has been to see the works. Two idealised naked male figures sit astride a couple of snarling panthers. The modelling is superb, the compositions elegant. These are bronze sculptures of the highest quality, but who did them? Art historians have been arguing about that for over 100 years. No longer, maybe. Academics at Cambridge University think they have found the answer. We’ve got some fantastic new Michelangelos, which we firmly believe on an aggregate of evidence - visual, technical and anatomical - to be early works by Michelangelo from 1586 to 1608. That means the 30-year-old Michelangelo would have produced them after carving his sculpture of David, but before starting work on painting the Sistine Chapel. To say these two pieces are by Michelangelo is a very big and significant claim. It would make them the only two known bronze sculptures in the world by the great Renaissance master. So what’s their evidence? This is exhibit A: a drawing they happened upon, showing a male figure on a panther. It’s not by Michelangelo, but it is a direct copy from him. Then there are the stylistic similarities between the way Michelangelo depicted certain physical details in his marble carvings, the anatomical accuracy of his drawings and the representation of both in the bronzes. Finally, there is the appliance of science, where they had specialist X-rays taken which have dated the works to a time that backs up their claim, but will it be supported by the wider academic community? What tends to happen is either that they’re fairly, almost surprisingly quickly accepted and become part of the great canon of art, or they’re equally swiftly forgotten, and three minutes later, nobody remembers them at all. If they are by Michelangelo, their value would rocket well above the £1.8 million a private collector reportedly paid for them in 2002, and a new chapter would open on the extraordinary legacy of a great Italian artist.

Accused of electoral fraud - a court hears claims against the Mayor of Tower Hamlets. Plus, how cold could it get this week? Your local and national forecast coming up. Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. London’s population is now the biggest it’s ever been. City Hall confirmed today that there are around 8.6 million people living in the capital, the highest since 1939. It’s also estimated that there’ll be 10.2 million by the year 2039. Of all the boroughs, Hillingdon has seen the biggest growth in the last 75 years, up 82%. From there, in the first in our series ‘Crowded Capital’ our Political Editor Tim Donovan reports. Could it be him perhaps? Or could it be her maybe? just two hours old. Really happy. For me, I am very happy. A very painful labour. Somewhere across London, possibly here at Hillingdon Hospital, there’s been a record-breaking birth. The capital has more people than ever. Little Fynn has become one of them. We are feeling OK, aren’t we? You are happy little baby? It is here in Hillingdon where the population has grown most since 1939. An 80% rise. 130,000 more people. The capital is shifting outwards, pushing up against the greenbelt, out of the slums into the suburbs. London as a whole has grown steadily since the 1980s when a new post-industrial economy took shape around finance and the city. The change really was the rate of employment. Employment has been declining. London had lost a million manufacturing jobs over 50 years. It is when office and service sector employment started to grow again and offices were starting to be built in central London - those jobs drew people back in. That was the trigger for London to grow again. Those one million manufacturing jobs have been replaced by one million service sectorjobs. The capital is now growing at the rate of 2,000 people a week. London’s rebirth and growth could not have happened without migration and immigration. More people are come from the rest of the UK than are coming from other countries in the world. But a biggerfactor in the growth actually is births. More people are being born than dieing in London, partly because it is a young city. There’s been a big surge in births. That’s the biggest immediate cause of London’s population growth. It is in Tower Hamlets, in the shadow of the City, where the population is growing fastest. There seems to be a lot of... First the Huguenots then the jews and then Bengalis in the ‘70s and now new settlers. We have young, quite rich affluent people moving in. Communities mingling together. It’s been a really exciting time, but new ways of immigration. Some people say the hipsters and the trendy community are coming into the areas. The next wave of immigration. Also a lot of people who are settling here from Eastern Europe and other places as well. It’s a wonderful rich area of all of sort of all different communities mixing together, which is quite exciting. Back in Hillingdon, they are now seeing more younger families settling. More children needing schools. And holding... My finger. Has the rate of new arrivals caught us unprepared, like not enough midwives? We may not have predicted as many births as indeed we’ve had. It does take a few years to train up a midwife. London’s population may now officially be the biggest its ever been, but it has not peaked. It is set to keep on growing and growing. What will that mean for the capital’s infrastructure for its education, housing? Not just in the short term, but in the decades to come. And continuing our series Crowded Capital, tomorrow we’ll be looking at some of the creative solutions London schools are coming up with to deal with the the increase in pupil numbers. To find out more about the capital’s population, past, present and future, just go to our website where we’ve plenty of London facts and figures. Five people were injured after a bus crashed into a tree in central London today, ripping off the double-decker’s roof. London Ambulance say it was a miracle no-one was more seriously hurt. This is what’s left of the 91 bus. The entire roof torn clean off after a collision which left the road closed south-bound. One ODE PBSSEFIQEF what was left. A lucky escape for those on board and a shock for passers by. I was leaving uni. I heard a loud sound and saw the roof of the bus has fallen off the back. People sitting there, looking fairly taken aback. The first thing you think is maybe a bomb has gone off. There was a lot of shattered glass. People on the top deck, looking pretty surprised. Five people were treated by paramedics. Two were taken to hospital. Now the focus is on working out what happened. It is uncommon. It is not something we deal with very often at all and thankfully not many were injured on this occasion. It is something our crews are trained to deal with. There’s nothing more we know until further investigation is carried out. There is some bark miss from the tree. What led to the bus to collide with the tree, we don’t know at this stage. An investigation is under way as to how an every day journey on a London bus ended in this way. When Boris johnson was elected as Mayor, he pledged to protect ticket offices in underground stations across the capital. But today the first two were closed at Wimbledon and Queensway - with controversial plans to close all of them by April next year. Let’s get more details from Emilia Papadopoulos, who’s at Queensway tube station tonight. Remind us what these changes are about? Well, the ticket offices here at Queensway and South Wimbledon became the first in London to close today it is all part of the mayor’s plan to close all 256 offices throughout the capital. Transport for London say it will save £50 million per year and Eli billion by 2020. Now, you can see what Queensway looked like earlier today. It was a little bit busier than usual. This is a main concern about the plans which have been met with a lot of criticism. Union bosses say both staff and passengers would suffer, but London Underground insist it is the future of the Tube. The population of London is going to continue to grow and the passenger numbers will increase. That’s all great news but Transport for London is then trying to run a service with less staff. Safety will suffer. It is a significant reduction over several years for the number of people using ticket offices in Tube stations, so we think around less than 3% of alljourneys on the Tube start with a visit to the ticket office. We are responding to that. We are responding to technology, to a need to customers to have more visible station staff. Another criticism isle the potential impact it could have on the millions of tourists who visit the capital every year. A station like this one is particularly popular with visitors to the capital. There are concerned there might be fewer staff available to help them when they are trying to use the Tube for the first time. TFL have confirmed staff will be present in the ticket hall and on the platforms to assist passengers. Today’s closure of two offices is the start to big changes throughout the network. All ticket offices are due to close by April 2016. Thank you. The Mayor of Tower Hamlets stood accused of electoral fraud today. A special court heard claims of corrupt and illegal practices at the east London council- allegations he strongly denies. The case has been brought by four people who want to see the mayoral race re-run and Lutfur Rahman banned from office for five years. Our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer reports. His supporters cheered when he won the election last May, but Lutfur Rahman’s battle for control in Tower Hamlets is far from over. Today, more than eight months after voters went to the polls, the Tower Hamlet’s result was questioned in the High Court. A petition brought by these three people and one other, alleging fraud and voter intimidation. We feel determined to ask for a further election, and also for Rahman to be banned from office for five years. That is our objective. Our main objective is to make sure we restore democracy to Tower Hamlets. The court heard allegations that people were bullied at polling stations, the postal votes were fraudulently filled in and grants were given to groups likely to support Lutfur Rahman. All claims strongly denied. Barristers on both sides traded blows. Duncan Penny for the major. Francis Hoar speaking for election petitioners about Lutfur Rahman. I think it is politically motivated. I think some of the politicians and establishment cannot accept that Mayor Rahman has won the election fair and freely. First, they said an independent couldn’t win. Then they said that the turnout was low, and we proved them wrong on both of those occasions. The petitioners have launched their petition. They have made complaints and I think I can bring some evidence to bear about what happened in the election. I think I have a duty to do that. The second reason is personally allegations were made about me and my conduct and I need to defend myself. Tomorrow, Labour’sjohn Biggs will give evidence. He’s the first of what is expected to be around 100 witnesses. The trial itself could last anything up to two months. That’s about it from me. But for now I’ll wish you a very goodnight, and leave you with Georgina Burnett who’s got the weather for you. It is staying cold for a few days yet. There is a warning for ice and snow. It is for London and the surrounding areas. We may see some sleet. Ice will be our main issue for the morning commute. A cloudy, frosty day. It brightens up into the afternoon. The winds are switching to a northerly direction. It will feel a lot cooler than the highs of six Celsius. We may see the odd snow flurry during the day as well. For many we will miss them all together. There is a yellow warning for snow for the whole of Wednesday. We do need to be aware there is potential for disruption it is most likely on higher ground we will see it settle to any degree. Wednesday is a cloudy day really. Winds making it very chilly. Thursday is really the very windy day. That is where we will feel that wind-chill as well. But we see that high pressure is starting, or trying to build in there. We are taking in airfrom Europe, which will be colder and drier. By Friday, we are looking at a different day. Quite bright, but feeling very chilly, with quite strong winds still. Now, overthe weekend it chilly, with quite strong winds still. Now, over the weekend it is staying cold. Really for a good week or so we’ll hold on to that colder weather limit be mainly dry though as well. Less windy, at least. We start to see a change as we head towards the end of the week. Now, if we look at the outlook for the next few days, we can see temperatures staying at a steady six really. It isjust below the average for the time of year. Sometimes feeling colder because of the wind. This is the scene in northern Spain. Locals fought through the snow. We have seen a winter smorm in Detroit. What links us with these two, well thisjet stream. It is hard to break down. Hence a shift in the cold weather. The cold air either side of this big loop of the jet, to the south of which some very mild air, which has produced 11 Celsius in Greenland. Record-breaking for this time of the year. We are looking to subtle changes in wind direction to change the feel here day by day. With winds north to northeasterly, more snow showers to eastern and central parts of England. A covering of a few centimetres here and there. Here is where we see some of the coldest conditions, down to minus ten or 11 Celsius. Some further snow showers possible across central and eastern areas. They will turn to rain and sleet as temperatures lift later. Snow in Northern Ireland, northern Scotland will fade later on. A drier day towards western parts of England and Wales. Another cold one - towards western parts of England and Wales. Another cold one - two to six Celsius, the highs. A chilly night will follow. Perhaps not as cold as the night we have at the moment. Coldest conditions towards western areas, as this high pressure builds in. The winds lightest here. On the eastern flank of that, that is where we have the wind strengthening. It is down these eastern parts again, a mixture of rain, sleet, showers by the kooss. Some snow inland, giving -- coast. Some snow inland. A frosty start. Temperatures not far off today’s values. A very cold day across the south on Thursday due to the strength of the wind. One ortwo Thursday due to the strength of the wind. One or two wintry showers. The temperatures in the north are starting to lift a bit. Running around the northern flank of the high pressure system to end with us for the end of the week. High pressure into # When I see your face # There’s not a thing that I would change # Cos you’re amazing # just the way you are... # Raaarrr! # And when you smile # The whole world stops and stares for a while... # This year for Red Nose Day, do something truly amazing. Good evening. Thanks forjoining us. Plenty to take you through with Danny Murphy, jermaine janus and Phil Neville. We will put some of your comments to these three later on. The clock is ticking away. Which club has spent the money wisely? Has anyone got a bargain? There are less than 15 minutes left in the january transfer window, than 15 minutes left in the january transferwindow, so transfer window, so let’s go bargain hunting, yes! Now, let’s take a shifty.

Extra cloud in the North of Scotland, the odd spot of rain. Through the Central Lowlands and parts of Eastern Scotland the cloud breaking up, some sunshine comes through and 5 or 6 degrees. lis and 5s across Northern England and with a bit of extra cloud, maybe a few light rain showers at lower levels. A bit of sleet up over the hills. After a grey start, East Anglia and the Southeast brighten up quite nicely by the afternoon - some sunshine comes out. But notice still a few wintry showers down towards Kent. After a bright start for Somerset and for Devon, it clouds over in the afternoon but keeps some sunshine in Cornwall. The odd spot of rain to go with this area of cloud but the bulk of the afternoon rain will be pushing its way into the Eastern side of Wales. The Western side should stay fine and dry with some sunshine. Further North into Northern Ireland, again it looks pretty good. Broken cloud, some sunshine and 7 or 8 degrees of you’re lucky. And through the evening, well, a feature will be the strength of this wind which will be picking up all the while. It’s a cold wind which will be a real feature of things through the day on Friday. And it’ll be pretty cold. These are major towns and cities - a degree or so either side of freezing so rural spots will go a couple of degrees below. A chilly old start to Friday and, as I said, a real squeeze in those isobars between this deep low in the Mediterranean and the big high across the United Kingdom. That’s bringing this really cold wind across East Anglia and Southern counties of England. You really will notice that. It may say A or 5 degrees on the thermometer but a significant wind-chill factor to go with it and maybe one or two snow flurries moving through on that breeze. Further North the winds are much lighter, so the temperature around A or 5 degrees. Probably not feeling so, especially with a little sunshine. Through the latter part of Friday and on into Saturday, the orientation of the high shifts a little bit. Eventually we lose that really cold feed of air from the near continent and then we’re back to square one with the high just to the West of us and the winds going clockwise around it. A lot of cloud trapped underneath that high for the start of the weekend. Maybe a few spots of light rain and drizzle across the South of the UK but that’ll be moving away towards the South and then most places are dry but rather cloudy. It’s a similar look to things on Sunday. We’ve still got high pressure dominating things. The winds going clockwise around it. Not particularly windy but there will be a bit of a breeze. And still a lot of cloud but very little rain to speak of- just a few spits and spots across the North of the United kingdom. Most places dry for the second part of the weekend if a bit on the grey side and still in single figures across the board. And into the early part of the new week, the high is still with us, the winds still going clockwise around it. Not overly windy but there will be a bit of a breeze down the Eastern side of the UK but hardly any rain despite a lot of cloud. A few spits and spots in the North and West of Scotland but most places dry. Again it’s chilly with temperatures stuck in single figures. Beyond that? Well, confidence is fairly moderate for the evolution of things. But lower confidence for the timing and the detail. We start with a high to the West of us, the winds going clockwise around it and rain confined to the Northwest of the UK but many places will be dry. And the high looks like it’ll slip further Southwards allowing the winds to come in from the West which means the Atlantic influence comes back. Any rain again to the North and West, it should be essentially dry towards the South and East and temperatures might recover a little bit.

Elbert Mack the European Central Bank added to pressure on Greece and said it wouldn’t accept bonds as collateral for lending money to commercial banks. The finance minister said the central bank decision will have no adverse impact on its financial system. Our correspondent explains what the ECB has done. Greek government bonds and debt has been classified asjunk Greek government bonds and debt has been classified as junk for years. Despite being classified asjunk, the European Central Bank has had a waiver in place so that Greek banks can take thisjunk waiver in place so that Greek banks can take this junk rated debt and get cheap funding in return. What the European Central Bank has set unexpectedly and earlier than we thought would come is that from next week they won’t accept Greek government debt. That’s a problem because the Greek banks are the weak spot of the Greek economy. What’s been happening overjanuary and December is deposits have been pulled out, lots of them. I hesitate to say there is a run on Greek banks but there is a briskjog certainly on Greek banks and this doesn’t help. They can still get emergency liquidity support but that is more difficult and adds pressure on Greek banks and this would accelerate deposit outflow and they are looking quite ropey. Ross Ulbricht was found guilty on all seven counts for his role in a scheme that enabled around 200 million dollars of online drug sales using the anonymous payment system Bitcoin. From New York, the BBC’s Nick Bryant reports. This was a website that became the biggest online marketplace for illegal drugs in the world, Silk Road’s menu of narcotics included her when, Road’s menu of narcotics included herwhen, cocaine and LSD Road’s menu of narcotics included her when, cocaine and LSD and before being shut down by the FBI in 2013, it generated $200 million in business -- it generated $200 million in business -- heroin. Conducted with the electronic currency, bitcoin, granting customers anonymity. The FBI calls it the most sophisticated criminal marketplace on the internet. Its creator, loss or breach, looks like a typical entrepreneur but he was the kingpin of a drugs empire run from his laptop. Adopting the online alias dread Pirate Roberts, his empire was a street or neighbourhood but the entire world, using what is called the Tor network aware layers of encryption and thousands of relays made him hard to trace. So determined was he that his website should remain in the shadows that prosecutors are led he hired hitman to murder six people who threatened to disclose information on his customers and vendors -- to disclose information on his customers and vendors -- hitmen. There is no evidence the murders were carried out. The government says it shows that for all his technical know-how, he acted like a traditional drug baron. He was arrested at this library in San Francisco talking online with someone he thought was a colleague but who was in fact an undercover federal agents. The FBI tracked him down after he left his Gmail address on a website offering advice on how to access Silk Road. When you start setting it up it is easy to think of an anonymous network that won’t have any possibility of law enforcement catching you but when that hits the ground and you start working with other individuals and you start paying bills to support your criminal enterprise, those create traces of evidence that law enforcement can use to catch you. He could face a sentence of life in prison. The guilty verdict sends a powerful message: The darker recesses of the internet often no immunity from arrest. Wash your hands. It’s something we learn from childhood but now it seems to be causing a stir in Washington. It all started when a Republican Senator challenged certain regulations, like making employees wash their hands after using the bathroom. The BBC’s Rajini Vaidyanathan reports. You might be wondering why you are watching me wash my hands. The act of robbing soaked and water in our palms entered the political debate in Washington after one senator said forcing staff in places like Starbucks to wash their hands every time they go to the toilet is an example of government overreaching. I have no problem with Starbucks if they opt out of this policy so long as they post a sign that says we don’t require our employees to wash their hands after wiping. He has problems with signs which he says demonstrate the overregulation of the US government. He says it should be up to businesses and the market to decide. Does he have a point? I think that’s utterly ridiculous. I have worked at a Starbucks. I think you should wash your hands. That sounds absurd to me. I think there is legitimate concern about government overreaching at things that concern public health like vaccines or minimal things like washing hands that are proven to prevent disease should be encouraged and mandated -- prevent disease should be encouraged and mandated -- but. Some will go to any lengths to make sure you scrub properly as these videos from across the world show. How long do you take to wash your hands? Do you heed the instructions that people say you have to wash your hands? Ten second. Ten seconds? Yeah. When you wash your hands you’re supposed to go on all sides. 20 seconds is the recommendation, did you know that? No, I didn’t. recommendation, did you know that? No, Ididn’t. How long recommendation, did you know that? No, I didn’t. How long do you take you wash your hands? Usually it is the alphabet, I have learned that. # wash your hands. # after toilet use. Washing your hands should be as easy as ABC but as this debate shows, not everyone thinks you need to be told. That’s put me off now. If you’ve ever found an antique worth a bit of money in your garage or loft you’ll know how exciting such a discovery can be. Well imagine finding a car collection worth millions - that had been left hidden away for 50 years. That’s exactly what has happened in France, as Ben Bland reports. Rusty, broken, covered in dust and worth millions. 60 vintage cars hidden away for half a century. Now discovered in the grounds of a remote French castle thanks to a single phone call. The granddaughter of the late collector told an auction house she had a Ferrari 250 California. When the value arrived, he couldn’t believe what else he found. -- he couldn’t believe what else he found. -- valuer. The collection is estimated about 250 million euros. We hope to reach over 20 million. Really, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy restorable cars from the 1+os and 50. The collection of cars has gone on display at the Paris exhibition centre and they are UP Paris exhibition centre and they are up for sale on Friday. An exciting opportunity if you are good with engines and have a million or two to spare. We will leave you with that thought. Thanks very much for watching. Hi, there. Cold air is firmly with us at the moment. We’re seeing a few snow flurries to take us into Thursday morning. The cold air not sticking around for too much longer this dolphin shape of mild air out to the Atlantic is going to take a bite out of the cold, lifting those temperatures back to near normal for the time of year over the next few days. Before we get there, though, it is going to be another pretty cold night with a touch of frost across western areas, a few mist and fog patches here and there, and the cloud will continue to thicken up, bringing showers in off the North Sea, moving into eastern parts of England. Around the coastline, they’re quite likely to fall as rain. But come inland, and we could see sleet or even a little bit of snow, so things could be quite slippery first thing Thursday morning. The amount of snow still pretty difficult to get exactly spot on. Some of us will see the snow really struggling to settle. Others could get perhaps a centimetre, maybe two, in one or two spots. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, though, it’s likely to be a rather cloudy and dull start to the day. That cloud rather low in places and rather misty over the hills, too. Probably the best of any early morning brightness will be across Wales and south west England. There we have those snow showers working in across parts of the Midlands, central-southern England possibly as well. Elevation will certainly help areas like the Chilterns and the Downs perhaps more likely than others to see some heavier bursts of snow fora time. As we head into Thursday afternoon, this cloudy strip of weather is going to work into Wales and south west England, with the snow showers tending to turn back to rain here. Across Kent, there is a chance of seeing a few snow showers here through the afternoon. The skies gradually brightening up across the east. Another fairly chilly day. Temperatures, at best, around five degrees Celsius or so. For Friday, we’ve got this area of low pressure in the Mediterranean, bringing a risk of some flooding rain to the Balkans - some further snowfall across northern Italy and the Alps, particularly. High pressure still across the United Kingdom, but due to the pressure gradient, we’re going to see the winds pick up, and those winds will be bitter winds coming in from the cold continent. Temperatures four or five degrees Celsius, but feeling colder than that due to those brisk winds across England and Wales. The further north you go, the winds are that bit lighter. The temperatures are the same, but it won’t feel quite as cold across more northern stretches. A lot of dry weather, then, to end the week. Here’s Saturday’s chart you’ll see that milderair coming in off the Atlantic, moving its way down the North Sea. A lot of moisture mixed in with this, so we’re expecting a lot of fairly low cloud, perhaps even a few spots of drizzle, especially towards some of these eastern coasts and hills. Temperature wise, though for Saturday, we’re looking at temperatures coming back up to near average for the time of year, if not an odd degree above. For the weekend, a lot of cloud around. The weather mostly dry, but not as cold as it has been. Dramatic images have been released of the moments before a TransAsia Airways plane clipped a bridge and crashed into a river in Taipei. 31 people were killed and at least 12 others are still missing.

China’s Central bank cuts the amount of money banks need to hold in reserve as it attempts to drive its slowing economy. And why South Koreans are increasingly favouring foreign cars over home-grown ones. Thank you forjoining us for this addition of Asia Business Report. China’s Central bank has moved to stem a slowdown in growth by cutting the amount of cash the country’s banks have to hold in reserve. The decision is aimed at boosting lending to try and get the economy moving. It is viewed as effective as a cut in interest rates and is the first industry right -- a cut in interest rates and is the first industry right -- industrywide move since 2012. I asked about more details on this initiative. It is not huge. It is 50 basis points for most banks. A further 50 for small firms in the agricultural sector. We estimate a total that is like an injection of 600 billion. That is quite similar to injections we had last year, even though they were targeted. The difference is, this cut that was announced publicly, it is a signal that they are taking a more combative stance. So basically it is 1.5 of 1%. -- zero .5%. We’ll both of these factors make a difference in kickstarting the economy? The reserve are increasing liquidity in the banking system. I think the impact will not be immediate. At this time of year, the central bank is usually injecting liquidity anyway. There is a surgeon in cash demand ahead of the new year. Perhaps they are taking this measure instead of their usual liquidity injections. But this is a permanent injection. Is this basically the first of several acts from the central bank to cut more of the reserve requirements? We think it is. We are forecasting further cuts this year. The central bank is concerned about current momentum. If growth was stable, a lot of that had to do with the surge in the stock market. State own farms benefit most. In this case, the central bank has tried to mitigate that by cutting the reserve for banks that lend more to smaller firms. They are trying to improve the allocation of credit in order to have a better bang for your buck with credit. The European Central bank has put pressure on the new Greek government, saying Greece’s banks can no longer use government bonds to access ECB credit.

Consumers want imported luxury. For months, the falling oil price has been making headlines. It has been on the slide since june of last year, dropping from $115 to barrel to $46. There has been an unexpected turnaround, a rise of 20%. What is in store for the rest of the year? I spoke to an oil market specialist. This is what happens when OPEC stops managing the market. We have seen a reaction to the lack of consensus about what is the real flaw for prices would be marginal cost of production. That is the US shale oil. It is still difficult to determine. The risk is, and this is worthy outlook sees, higher prices, the actual hit two US production is not as strong. OPEC ends up in the worst of two worlds, with low prices, but not managing to stop production. Are we likely to see OPEC coming back into the picture? It looks quite the opposite. Every producer is trying to put in as much as possible. Even Saudi Arabia is close to 10 million barrels per day. Iraq and the United Arab Emirates are close to capacity. At this point, seeing oil prices fall yet again, could it go any lower? It certainly could. The forecast showed that in the second quarter there would be an average of $36 per barrel. It is interesting how the production policy of OPEC countries interacts with the price. Had the cut production two months ago, the price could have stabilised. Saudi Arabia producing nearly 8 million barrels per day. Even if they go to their total capacity of 12 million barrels, the revenue is less. A quick look at the markets and Asian stocks.

Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena had been accused of carrying out the illegal procedure after the woman gave birth at the Whittington Hospital in London in 2012. The jury at Southwark Crown Court took less than half-an-hour to clear him. june Kelly’s report contains flash photography. REPORTER: How do you feel about the verdict? The up-and-coming young doctor who became a criminal suspect. Dhanuson Dharmasena cleared of subjecting one of his patients to female genital mutilation. FGM as it is known is practised in some communities from Africa, the Middle East and Asia and leads to major physical problems The doctor described how he had to reverse the damage that had been done to the woman so he could deliver her baby. Afterwards, he carried out a procedure on her, which the prosecution said was the same as the original FGM she’d undergone. The doctor said he didn’t realise he’d broken the law. Dr Dharmasena said he’d never received any training in dealing with FGM and it was the first time he’d treated a patient who’d undergone it. After the birth, the Trust here launched an investigation and then went to the police. One anti-FGM campaigner, Nimco Ali, believes it’s right this case was tested in the courts. Nobody’s above the law and you cannot necessarily say that we cannot prosecute people that might have committed FGM or people suspect might have committed FGM, and I think that’s a great thing that this case has done that. The law applies like, you know, to everybody and anybody. FGM is practised on some young girls from Africa and the Middle East. It leads to physical and mental problems. It has been illegal in the UK for 30 years but this was the first prosecution. It is being questioned by one senior gynaecologist. Why do I think the case was brought? I think there was a lot of pressure to bring about a successful prosecution for FGM and they were looking around to see if they could find one, but this was not the right one to bring. Tonight the CPS said it was the right decision to put the doctor in the dock. Dr Dharmasena now faces an investigation by the General Medical Council. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. Hello, I’m Marc Edwards, and this is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sports centre. -- live from the BBC Sports Centre. Here’s what we’ve got coming up on the show: Ivory Coast are through to the Africa Cup of Nations Final with a 3-1 win over DR Congo. It’s a landmark appearance for Steven Gerrard as Liverpool leave it late in their FA Cup tie. And case closed, but at what cost? Rory Mcllroy settles out of court with his former agents. Hello, thanks forjoining us. We’ll have news of Steven Gerrard’s 700th appearance for Liverpool coming up shortly, but we kick off with the Africa Cup of Nations, where Ivory Coast are through to the final after claiming a comfortable 3-1 victory over DR Congo in Bata. The Elephants will now face either Ghana or hosts Equatorial Guinea this weekend after goals from Yaya Toure, Gervinho and Wilfried Kanon helped the 2012 runners up to victory. Our correspondent, Piers Edwards, was soaking in the post match atmosphere, let’s take a listen. Ivory Coast fans are in a joyous mood after reaching their third Africa Cup of Nations finals in six tournaments, making it through beating DR Congo 3-1 with goals from Yaya Toure, shipping bingo and Kanon giving them the goals -- Gervinho. Having reached the finals, can they finally win their first title since 1992? That would make these finals even more exciting. As we already mentioned, that second semi-final is between Ghana and the hosts Equatorial Guinea on Thursday, but the four-time champions could be without their star striker, Asamoah Gyan. The 29-year-old was injured in the Black Stars’ quarter-final victory over Guinea on Sunday by a late flying kick to the stomach from goalkeeper Naby Yattara, who was sent off for his endeavours. And it’s a happy 700th appearance for Steven Gerrard at Liverpool as the reds finally saw off a resolute Bolton side in their FA Cup fourth round replay. However, it was the Trotters who went ahead through former Barcelona striker, Eidur Gudjohnsen from the penalty spot. And despite having a man sent off it looked like the home side would be causing the latest FA Cup upset. But England’s Raheem Sterling popped up to equalise in the 86th minute before Phillipe Coutinho broke Bolton hearts in injury time to complete a remarkable turnaround 2-1 to Liverpool who head to Crystal Palace in the fifth round. You can see from the replay it was no nearer penalty. It was always going to be a tough game. Lenin has made the team very difficult to beat. We had a lot of chances before they got the penalty and I think you can see on the replay that it was nowhere near penalty. That put us on the back foot away from home. The players showed the character and spirit within the team. We hit the bar about five or six times, chance and had other chances. Eventually we got there in the end. ~ "" WE -- we had other chances. We have a lot of attackers on the field and the quality came through.

In Germany, Borussia Dortmund are still bottom of the Bundesliga after losing at home to Augsburg on Wednesday. The only goal of the game was scored early in the second half by Augsburg’s Argentine striker, Raul Bobadilla. They’re up to fourth in the table. But they finished the game with 10 men when Christoph janker’s foul on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang earned him a straight red card. Dortmund remain two points adrift at the foot of the table, much to the disgust of their angry fans. Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller there trying his best to keep them calm. In Italy, Gonzalo Higuain scored the only goal of the game as Napoli beat Inter to reach the last four of the Coppa Italia. They’ll play Lazio in their two-legged semi-final. German international forward Andre Schurrle was officially welcomed as a Wolfsburg player at the club’s stadium in Lower Saxony on Wednesday. The World Cup winnerjoined the Bundesliga club from Chelsea after 18 months in London, but he says he’s grateful for the time he spent in the English Premier League. ~ I still love this club. The team is amazing. The staff, the guys who work there, they are amazing, so I developed my game, I am a different player. When they came to Chelsea and now, so, yeah, it helped me a lot to be in this team, to work with jose Mourinho and the other players and so I will never regret this, I had a wonderful time and now I am happy to be here at Wolfsburg and I hope I can help the team immediately. Serena Williams has ended her boycott of Indian Wells, 14 years after suffering racist abuse at the tournament. The Australian Open winner has confirmed her attendance at BNP Paribas Open in March. Williams recently beat Maria Sharapova in the final of the Aussie Open last month to earn herself a 19th Grand Slam title. However, the world number one’s last appearance at Indian Wells was back in 2001, when she triumphed to take the title a second time. Rory McIlroy’s multi-million dollar court case against his former agents, Horizon Sports Management, has ended afterjust two days with an out-of-court settlement. Our Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler reports from Dublin. They were once friends and business partners, Rory Mcllroy, the top golfer in the world and his former agent, Horizon Sports Managemen. A bitter fallout led them to court with those disagreements threatening to become public -- Horizon Sports Management. Yesterday in stock of the starting there were 11 hour negotiations the sides that lasted long into the night-- instead of. And today the Kaye Scott under way there was an announcement of a deal -- before the case of. The dispute between Rory Mcllroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties. We wish each other well in the future. Neither party will be making any further comment. How much money was exchanged? No further comment. It is thought the settlement will seek Rory Mcllroy pay Horizon Sports Management many millions, the sum agreed thought to be well over $20 million. Horizon Sports Management secured several money sponsorship deals for him, including one with Nike. Tiger, seek? There were fights overseas when Rory McIlroy’s lawyers say the contract was signed on the day with great informality. Pick champion wanted to get the contract ruled invalid and unenforceable but Horizon countersued for millions of pounds of unpaid fees and breaches of contract -- The Open championship. This avoids the eight-week trial in which the financial and legal affairs of one of the best-known sportsmen in the world could have been exposed. Rory Mcllroy was in court yesterday however he didn’t turn up to the short hearing today. Despite his success, this case has been hanging over Rory Mcllroy. Now it is over, he can concentrate on the course rather than the courts. England’s rugby squad have been training to the sound of hymns and crowd noise, ahead of Friday’s Six Nations opener against Wales. Head coach Stuart Lancaster has admitted arranging for the sounds to be played over loudspeakers in a bid to get his players used to the atmosphere at the Millenium stadium. Over half the current team have never played at the Welsh national stadium, and Lancaster is keen that his side are as prepared for the noise as they can be. Two years ago England went to Cardiff chasing the Grand Slam but were heavily beaten, which allowed Wales to take the title. We were saying to the players two years ago leading into the game that because of the acoustics of the stadium, because it is so loud, you cannot hear yourself think sometimes. Or at least communicate, more importantly. The on field communication is about scanning. We wanted to replicate that for those who haven’t been there. just to show the way you communicate with each other nonverbally or whatever else is going to be important because it is so loud that they can’t hear it sometimes. It was just to replicate that and make sure that we prepare properly this time. Preparation for any international side is meticulous. They have looked at that and learn from the experience. Likewise, we had the experience many years ago in Twickenham with music blaring, one side of the pitch, and we found it difficult in the warmup prior to the game. It is about learning from those experiences. They experienced that and they are trying to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thousands of New England Patriots fans braved the cold and snowy streets of Boston to welcome back their Superbowl winning heroes. The team rolled through the city in a parade celebrating their last-minute 28 to 24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday’s NFL championship extravaganza. Tom Brady was voted the games Most Valuable Player, but had Malcolm Butler to thank for thwarting what seemed like an inevitable victory by Seattle with a goal-line interception with 26 seconds remaining. That’s almost all the time we’ve got left for now, just a quick recap of our top story and Ivory Coast are through to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations for 3rd time since 2006. They comfortably beat DR Congo 3-1 with goals from Yaya Toure, Gervinho and Wilfried Kanon. That’s all the time we’ve got left for now but you can get all the latest sports news at our website.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland, though, it’s likely to be a rather cloudy and dull start to the day. That cloud rather low in places and rather misty over the hills, too. Probably the best of any early morning brightness will be across Wales and south west England. There we have those snow showers working in across parts of the Midlands, central-southern England possibly as well. Elevation will certainly help areas like the Chilterns and the Downs perhaps more likely than others to see some heavier bursts of snow fora time. As we head into Thursday afternoon, this cloudy strip of weather is going to work into Wales and south west England, with the snow showers tending to turn back to rain here. Across Kent, there is a chance of seeing a few snow showers here through the afternoon. The skies gradually brightening up across the east. Another fairly chilly day. Temperatures, at best, around five degrees Celsius or so. For Friday, we’ve got this area of low pressure in the Mediterranean, bringing a risk of some flooding rain to the Balkans - some further snowfall across northern Italy and the Alps, particularly. High pressure still across the United Kingdom, but due to the pressure gradient, we’re going to see the winds pick up, and those winds will be bitter winds coming in from the cold continent. Temperatures four or five degrees Celsius, but feeling colder than that due to those brisk winds across England and Wales. The further north you go, the winds are that bit lighter. The temperatures are the same, but it won’t feel quite as cold across more northern stretches. A lot of dry weather, then, to end the week. Here’s Saturday’s chart, you’ll see that milderair coming in off the Atlantic, moving its way down the North Sea. A lot of moisture mixed in with this, so we’re expecting a lot of fairly low cloud, perhaps even a few spots of drizzle, especially towards some of these eastern coasts and hills. Temperature wise, though for Saturday, we’re looking at temperatures coming back up to near average for the time of year, if not an odd degree above. For the weekend, a lot of cloud around. The weather mostly dry, but not as cold as it has been. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. Emergency teams in Taiwan are searching for 12 people missing the TransAsia plane crash - 31 people are confirmed dead. The journalist Peter Greste says his two Aljazeera colleagues were happy to see him freed from their jail in Egypt- but leaving them behind was extremely difficult. It was tough you know, we’d discussed this prospect, we knew that there was always a chance that one of us would leave and the others would have to stay - that doesn’t make it any easier. King Abdullah ofjordan vows relentless war against Islamic State after a captured jordanian pilot is burned alive by the militant group. Swapping bit coins for hard time - the mastermind of a $200 million online drugs empire is found guilty by a court in New York. And one hand washes the other in Washington - but should politicians have a say on the hygiene of employees? Hello. A plane, impossibly low headed into the river nearby. Investigators in Taiwan have recovered the black box. There were hot stopping pictures taken from passing cars as the plane clipped a bridge with its wing. four minutes when pilots raised the alarm. What the rescue people are trying to do is find any sign of the 12 passengers who are still missing. It is a very difficult process because it rained overnight and the water level has risen to four metres deep. That was much higher than yesterday. The marquee what’s -- muddy water made visibility difficult. You can see some of them are being pulled as they have gone through the river, trying to see anything. They are using flashlights under the water but they cannot see anything. They have not found any signs of the 12 missing passengers. Such goes on. They are looking at an area that is five kilometres downstream from the crash site. They have put up a net downstream to prevent passengers and debris from the aeroplane from flowing down the river. It is a very difficult reserves and they have been out here for hours. There is very little hope that these 12 passengers who are still missing will found a live because it has now been 24 since the plane crash and the water here is very cold, 10 Celsius. The rescuers told me they do believe they will find anyone. In the centre of Taiwan’s capital Taipei this morning, drivers catch a glimpse of something falling from the sky, the twin-propeller plane with 58 people on board appears to have suffered a sudden loss of power shortly after ta ke-off. Another car also fitted with a dashboard camera was even closer. The wing tip strikes the roof of the taxi in front. The plane finally came to rest upside down and broken in a shallow river. That anyone could survive might see in extraordinary. But 15 were rescued, including a two-year-old boy. They located the cockpit by nightfall. The last recorded words from the flight deck had been, May Day, May Day, engine flame out. The work is continuing into the night with heavy lifting gear. You can see a large part of the plane has been brought out onto the riverbank. There are submerged sections where bodies could be trapped. After so long in the water, this is no longer a rescue mission, but a recovery operation. This is the second fatal accident for the Taiwan -based TransAsia Airways in less than a year. The black boxes will hold the key as to why in good weather a relatively new plane with experienced pilots appears to fall out of the sky. As you can see right now, the search is still going on and from the report you can tell that 15 people amazingly survived this crush including the father and mother of the trigger of boy. On local television, we have seen that the father was able to buckle seatbelt. He and unbuckled his wife’s seatbelt and then realised that his son was submerged. He lifted him up and realised he had swallowed somewhat. We hear that the boy is doing fine. The people who were injured only suffered light injuries. We may have some trouble with your link but we will try to get some clear audio. What is happening? It is unclear what caused this accident but looking at the pictures the plane was tilted to one side and what we had in that last package, there was an indication that something went wrong with the engines. This is the fourth accident involving this type of aeroplane, belonging to the same airline in about 20 years. The authorities have ordered all the Arab planes -- aeroplanes to be inspected by the end of today. They are being inspected today. We are hearing that he company will be sending experts here to help retrieve the information from the black box, but that could take as long as one year to do a final analysis on the black box, so it could be a long time before we know what caused this accident. Brimming with smiles - Peter Greste, the Australian journalist who was freed from an Egyptianjail after 400 days, has given his first formal news conference after returning home to Brisbane. Peter Kay men grinning ear to ear, flanked by his parents and his brother Michael. There were a applause from the media. He seemed on good form. He seemed very healthy though he has lost a few kilograms of weight. He talked a little bit about what it was like arriving back in Australia last night. It is incredible to be here. Last night it was extraordinary to walk into the press game. It was unbelievable. I have dreamt about this so many times. The reality is nowhere near what I imagined it to be. It is so much better. This has been an extraordinary odyssey everyone, for mY extraordinary odyssey everyone, for my family and for every one of our supporters. I want to thank everyone who has been involved in this campaign. He was asked about his treatment inside the prison and said that the treatment was fine, he said people treated him with dignity and respect. He did not want to go into detail about the conditions they are all the attitude to be Egyptian government. He did talk about how he tried to stay physically and mentally strong. I knew, particularly because it was an open ended process, we never knew how it was going to end. We needed to power for the long haul. -- propound. was going to end. We needed to power forthe long haul. -- propound. I know from my reading is about people who have been through difficult times that you need to be fair, not just physically fit but intellectually and spiritually fit. Me and my colleagues made a deliberate effort at staying physically fair, we had limited space but we made sure we worked out, we kept ourselves healthily. They were exercising every day. He said that he started a Masters in International relations inside the prison as well as doing meditation. Of course, he was asked about his colleagues. He said it was incredibly difficult to say goodbye to them, that he simply hugged them and said CQ to them, that he simply hugged them and said CO when I see you. Obviously he is keen to keep up the campaign and keep the momentum going so they are released as soon as possible. Having talked it through, we understood what the circumstances were and they were very happy for me. You can imagine, after 400 days in prison with these guys, we are very close and it was very difficult to leave them behind. But I am grateful to be out is and I trust that they will follow in due course. It will take time and it will take some further evidence but we will see them out. Peter Greste delivered a serious message, but there was quite a lot of human today. When asked if he would like the first round of beers for his family, his brother Andrew said that he would be buying the beers for a poll here. He was also asked if he would go back tojournalism and he told his mother to avert her ears before telling the journalists that he was born to be a journalist and thatis he was born to be a journalist and that is what he would continue doing. Injordan King Abdullah has declared, what he called, a relentless war against the extremists of Islamic State, on their own territory. He was speaking a day after images were published of a jordanian pilot being burned to death by IS. Within hoursjordan announced it had executed two Al-Qaeda militants and said it would step up its role in the American-led military coalition against IS. Paul Adams reports from the pilot’s home village injordan. Far from jordan’s capital, in the peaceful hills above the Dead Sea, the very public rituals of condolences. This is the hometown ofjordan’s murdered pilot. A magnet now for thousands of people anxious to pay their respects. A chance to share the family’s grief, to embrace, to pray, and grapple with the sheer horror of what’s happened. Moaz al-Kasasbeh’s father will spend much of the next three days here in this tent. In that time, he’ll meet a great many well-wishers, but he’ll also hear a great number of questions. How, if at all, canjordan punish those responsible for his son’s death? What should the country’s role be in the US-led coalition against Islamic State? You said last week that you were not sure that this was jordan’s fight. Do you still feel that way today? TRANSLATION: I am now certain that jordan must fight them in their hideouts. Outside our borders because they are coming for us. We must fight them before they reach us. But before that, a gesture of revenge. This nondescript pre-dawn convoy carrying the bodies of two Al-Qaeda prisoners. Their longstanding death penalties now carried out. Later, on the road to the airport, displays of solidarity and defiance as King Abdullah returned home from Washington. This was hardly spontaneous, but as the King swept through it was heartfelt. This small country rallying together at a time of wounded pride. jordan says it is fighting back. The King, meeting security officials, spoke of a relentless war to protect faith, values and human principles. The government says it’s increasing its participation in the US-led coalition, but how far? Nobody was talking about ground troops. We’re talking about helping the Iraqi military. about helping the Syrian moderate opposition, or Peshmerga troops, in order to fight on the ground. The soldiers who come to offer their condolences don’t expect to be thrust into the fight, but the trauma of the past 10-days has brought the battle against Islamic State that much closer. Paul Adams, BBC News, jordan. In other news: Reports from Libya say a number of workers, including foreign nationals, were killed at a remote oilfield in an attack on Tuesday night. A senior military official at the Mabrook oilfield said twelve died, with most beheaded and some shot. Eyewitness reports suggest the gunmen described themselves as members of Islamic State. The chief executive of Brazil’s state-run oil giant, Petrobras, has resigned in the wake of a major corruption scandal. As well Maria das Graca Foster, five other executives also stepped down. Prosecutors say the scandal involved around $800 million in bribes and other illegal funds. China’s internet watchdog has banned web users from posting messages under the names of famous people. It said it was combating the ""vulgar culture"" of using names like Barack Obama, or those of Chinese officials. Also, nicknames should not include information that could subvert state power, undermine national security or promote rumour-mongering. The European Central Bank has added to the pressure on the new Greek government, saying it will no longer accept its bonds as collateral for lending money to commercial banks. Greece is hoping to renegotiate its bailout with the rest of the Eurozone. Greece’s Finance Ministry has said the central bank decision will have no adverse impact on the Greek financial system. BBC economics correspondent, Duncan Weldon, explains exactly what the ECB has done. Greek government bonds and government debt has been classified asjunk for years. It has been seen as not very safe. Despite being classified asjunk, this is the technical bit, the European Central Bank has had a waiver in place so that Greek banks can take thisjunk rated debt and get cheap funding in return. What the European Central Bank has said unexpectedly and earlier than we thought would come is that from next week they won’t accept Greek government debt. That’s a problem because the Greek banks are the weak spot of the Greek ECOFIOITIV. What’s been happening overjanuary and December is deposits have been pulled out, lots of deposits. I hesitate to say there is a run on Greek banks but there is certainly a briskjog on Greek banks and this doesn’t help. They can still get emergency liquidity support but that is more difficult and adds pressure on Greek banks and this would accelerate deposit outflow and they are looking quite ropey.

The latest headlines: These dramatic pictures from Taipei show the final moments of TransAsia Flight 235 as the plane clipped a highway bridge and crashed into a river. At least 31 people were killed. Aljazeera journalist Peter Greste has said his two colleagues were happy for him to be freed from jail in Egypt, but that leaving them behind was extremely difficult. The mastermind of the website known as Silk Road has been convicted in a New York court. Ross Ulbricht was found guilty on all seven counts for his role in a scheme that enabled around $200 million worth of online drug sales using the anonymous payment system Bitcoin. Nick Bryant reports from New York. This was the website that became the biggest online marketplace for illegal drugs in the world. Silk Road’s menu included heroine, cocaine and LSD, and before being shot down by the FBI in 2013, it generated over $200 million in business. All conducted with the electronic currency, bitcoins, which granted customers anonymity. The FBI calls it the most sophisticated criminal marketplace on the internet... Its creator, 30-year-old, Ross Ulbricht, looks like a typical dot com entrepreneur, but he was the king of the digital drugs empire run from his laptop. His market was notjust a street or neighbourhood, but the entire world. He used the Tor Dark Web network, where layers of encryption and thousands of relays made it hard to trace. So determined was Ulbricht that the network remain in the shadows, he hired hitmen to have killed six people who threatened to disclose information on his customers and vendors, according to prosecutors. There is no evidence that the murders were carried out, but the government says it shows that for all his technical know-how he acted like a traditional drug baron. Ulbricht was arrested at this library in San Francisco, chatting online with someone he thought was a colleague, but was in fact an undercover federal agent. The FBI tracked him down after he left his Gmail address on a website offering advice on how to access Silk Road. When you start out setting it up, it is in easy principle to think of an anonymous network that won’t have any possibility of law enforcement catching it, but when that hits the ground and you start working with other individuals and start paying bills to support your criminal enterprise, they create traces of evidence that law enforcement can use to catch you. He could face a sentence of life imprisonment, but the guilty verdict already sent a powerful message - that the darker recesses of the internet offer no immunity from arrest. Argentina’s President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has caused a bit of a Twitter storm. She’s currently on a state visit to Beijing, seeking badly needed investment for her country’s struggling economy. But as she was meeting with her host, President Xijinping, this post came up on her Twitter feed: Tweeting in Spanish she tried to mimic a Chinese accent by switching r’s with l’s, the offending line translating as: Did they only come for lice and petloleum. A few minutes later, another tweet appeared with an apology saying the levels of ridiculousness and absurdity were so high they could only be digested with humour. There has not been any official response from China, but tweeters in Argentina have criticised the remark as being tactless and racist. The 90-year-old President of Zimbabwe has fallen over in public. Robert Mugabe had been speaking to supporters from a podium in the capital Harare and was walking to his car when he appeared to miss a step and toppled. His aides quickly helped him up and escorted him to his limousine. Some of the photographers who captured the fall said they were forced to delete their pictures by security personnel. Mugabe’s spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Wash your hands. It’s something we learn from childhood but now it seems to be causing a stir in Washington. It all started when a Republican Senator challenged certain regulations, like making employees wash their hands after using the bathroom. The BBC’s Rajini Vaidyanathan reports. You might be wondering why you are watching me wash my hands. The act of rubbing soap and water in our palms entered the political debate in Washington after one senator said forcing staff in places like Starbucks to wash their hands every time they go to the toilet is an example of government overreaching. I have no problem with Starbucks if they opt out of this policy so long as they post a sign that says we don’t require our employees to wash their hands after wiping. He has problems with signs which he says demonstrate the overregulation of the US government. He says it should be up to businesses and the market to decide. Does he have a point? I think that’s utterly ridiculous. I have worked at a Starbucks. I think you should wash your hands. ~ I don’t even know, that sounds absurd to me. I think there is legitimate concern about government overreach but things that concern public health like vaccines or minimal things like washing hands that are proven to prevent disease should be encouraged and mandated. Some will go to any lengths to make sure you scrub properly as these videos from across the world show. How long do you take to wash your hands? Do you heed the instructions that people say you have to wash your hands? Ten seconds. Ten seconds? Yeah. When you wash your hands you’re supposed to go on all sides. 20 seconds is the recommendation, did you know that? No, Ididn’t. How long do you take you wash your hands? -- How long do you take to wash your hands? Usually it is the alphabet, I have learned that. # wash your hands. # after toilet use. Washing your hands should be as easy as ABC, but as this debate shows, not everyone thinks you need to be told. After toilet use. If you’ve ever found an antique worth a bit of money in your garage or loft you’ll know how exciting such a discovery can be. Well imagine finding a car collection worth millions that had been left hidden away for 50 years. That’s exactly what has happened in France, as Ben Bland reports. Rusty, broken, covered in dust and worth millions. 60 vintage cars that have been hidden away for half a century. Now discovered in the grounds of a remote French castle thanks to a single phone call. The granddaughter of the late collector, told an auction house she had a Ferrari 250 California. When the valuer arrived, he couldn’t believe what else he found. The collection is estimated about 12-50 million euros. We hope to reach over 20 million. Really, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy restorable cars from the 40s and 50s. The collection of cars has gone on display at the Paris exhibition centre and they are up for sale on Friday. An exciting opportunity if you are good with engines and have a million or two to spare. And you can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. I’m @BBC Mike Embley. Hi, there. Cold air is firmly with us at the moment. We’re seeing a few snow flurries to take us into Thursday morning. The cold air not sticking around for too much longer, this dolphin shape of mild air out to the Atlantic is going to take a bite out of the cold, lifting those temperatures back to near normal for the time of year over the next few days. Before we get there, though, it is going to be another pretty cold night with a touch of frost across western areas, a few mist and fog patches here and there, and the cloud will continue to thicken up, bringing showers in off the North Sea, moving into eastern parts of England. Around the coastline, they’re quite likely to fall as rain. But come inland, and we could see sleet or even a little bit of snow, so things could be quite slippery first thing Thursday morning.

Our top stories: Dramatic images have been released of the moments before a TransAsia Airways plane clipped a bridge and crashed into a river in Taipei. 31 people were killed and at least 12 others are still missing. The Al jazeera journalist, Peter Greste, has given a press conference in Australia. He said his two colleagues, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who are still in an Egyptian prison, were happy for him to be freed but that it was very difficult to leave them behind and he hoped they’d be released soon.

Now on BBC News, all the latest business news live from Singapore. Boosting growth, China’s central bank cut the amount of money banks need to hold in reserve as it attempts to drive its slowing economy. And, why South Koreans are increasingly favouring foreign cars over home-grown ones. Welcome to Asia Business Report. China’s central bank has moved to stem a slowdown in growth by cutting the amount of cash the country’s banks have to hold in reserve. It is aimed at boosting lending to try to get the economy moving. It is widely viewed as being as effective as a cut in interest rates and is the first industrywide move since 2012. Earlier, I spoke with China economist with Capital Economics, to asking for more details of this initiative. In terms of size it is not huge. It is 50 basis points for large banks, and we estimate in total it is like an injection of 600 million into the bank’s balance sheets. That is similar to injections we had last year, even though those were targeted. The key difference this time is it is a broad-based cut that was announced publicly, signalling that they are taking a more proactive start going forward. So that is basically half of 1%? You have this ratio, plus the cut in interest rates in November. We’ll both of these factors make a difference in kickstarting the economy, which expanded by 7.4% in 2014, and the data showed a contraction. Cutting the RRR probably has a big impact on cutting interest rates, because it increases mobility in the banking system. The impact would be immediate, because at this time of year the central bank is usually injecting liquidity anyway, because there is usually a surge in cash demand before the Chinese New Year. Perhaps they are just taking this instead of their usual injections. The key difference is this is a permanent injection, so after the Chinese New Year the extra liquidity will still be in the system. Is this basically the first of several at by the central bank to make further cuts? We think so. The central bank is concerned about current momentum, because it was stable in the fourth quarter but much of that had to do with the surge in the stock market. Where is that most felt in the economy? Usually it is state-owned firms that benefit most from cuts, because they have the best access to bank lending. In this case, the central bank tries to mitigate that by cutting the reserve for banks that lend to small firms. Think that is the key, because they are trying to improve the allocation of credit in order to have more bang for your buck for credit, as it were. The European Central bank has added pressure on the new Greek government saying that it no longer backs the government bonds to access ECB credit. Greece is seeking to negotiate its bailout with the rest of the eurozone. The owner of KFC and McDonald’s restaurants, Yum! Brands, said that they fell by 16% in the three months to December, which was less than expected. Shares were up more than 2% in US trade. At the end of last year, the firm is slashed profit forecasts after a food safety scandal in China. Stocks and General Motors have gained more than 5% after posting a number of $1.1 billion. Its earnings overall fell by 3%. It was good news for Toyota yesterday when it raised its annual pocket Outlook. But in Korea, where local makers have dominated the market, there are some new players in town. Luxury European models have gone up by 23% over the past year. This nation is car crazy. Korea’s own version of Top Gear is one of the most popular TV shows. Inside the studio, the obsession is increasingly with flashy European cars. This is a change. Korea’s version ofjeremy Clarkson says it used to be unacceptable for Koreans to buy anything other than Korean. TRANSLATION: During the late 90s, I drove an imported convertible. One morning Ifound the roof completely slashed by a knife. Many other import owners shared similar experiences. People were angry that Korean money was going to foreign companies. But taste is changing. In 2000, only 6000 foreign cars were imported to South Korea. Last year, it was 196,000. Koreans flock to this huge glossy showroom in Seoul. Thisjump in demand for foreign is despite loyalty to the home brands. Grey, grey, white, this is a very conservative, that is. Always the same boring colours. But as Koreans get richer, they are getting much more adventurous. BMW hasjust built a huge track in Seoul were Koreans can go for a spin, literally. john is the new breed of Korean, in love with a German vehicle. Korean cars are good, but I think they are more boring in a sense. I think it is like many family cars. Where it is comfortable, it is relaxing, there is good space inside. But it is not really the best option for ""fun to drive"". Korean manufacturers are trying to raise their game. Brightening up the brand to cater to more affluent customers. Hyundai has opened a glittering prestige showroom in downtown Seoul. But the Europeans have already revved up. Consumers want imported luxury. Falling oil price has been making headlines, which has been on the slide since june last year, dropping from 100 to 50 US dollars, to as low as $46 by mid-january. For the first few days of February there has been an unexpected turnaround, a rise of 20% before dropping again. In US and Asian trading, it dropped by about 9%. What is in store for the rest of the month? I spoke earlier to an oil market specialist. This is what happens when OPEC stops managing the market. We have seen a clear reaction to the lack of consensus about what is the real float for prices in terms of the marginal cost of production of the highest cost production, which is US shale oil. It is very difficult to determine that within a range, and the risk is, and this is what the outlook sees, is that with higher prices, as we have seen in the past two days, the actual heat to US production is not as strong to have a long-lasting effect, so OPEC ends up in the worst of two worlds. Low prices, but not managing to dent production on US shale. Are we likely to see OPEC coming back into the picture and managing this oil supply? It looks quite the opposite, in the sense that every OPEC producer is tried to PUmP that every OPEC producer is tried to pump as much as possible. Even Saudi Arabia is now closer to 10 million barrels per day. Iraq and the UAE are pumping close to capacity. At this point, seeing oil prices fall yet again between 6-9% overnight, could it go any lower? Below $46 per barrel? It could. In the second quarter, it has been focused that there will be -- predicted that there will be an average of $46 per barrel. You could think that if OPEC had cut production two months ago, the price could have stabilised at around $80 per barrel. Saudi Arabia possibly producing 8 million barrels per day. Now they didn’t cut, even if they go to their total capacity, the revenue is less than they would have got. Asian stocks were mixed after the European Central bank took a hardline stance on Greece -- Greece’s debt. Australia will benefit, which trades several resources like oil and war-- coal and all to do the Chinese mainland. These dramatic pictures from Taipei show the final moments of TransAsia Flight 235 as the plane clipped a highway bridge and crashed into a river. At least 31 people were killed. Aljazeera journalist, Peter Greste has said his two colleagues were happy for him to be freed from jail in Egypt, but that leaving them behind was extremely difficult. After the first prosecution of its kind in Britain, an NHS doctor has been found not guilty of performing female genital mutilation, or FGM, OI’I B VOUFIQ ITIOti’IâIâ. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena had been accused of carrying out the illegal procedure after the woman gave birth at the Whittington Hospital in London in 2012. The jury at Southwark Crown Court took less than half an hour to clear him. june Kelly’s report contains flash photography. How do you feel about the verdict? He described himself as being relieved. He’s the up and coming young doctor who became a criminal suspect. Dhanuson Dharmasena, cleared of subjecting one of his patients to female genital mutilation. FGM, as it’s known, is practised in some communities from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The woman had undergone FGM when she was six. The doctor described how he had to reverse the damage that had been done to the woman so he could deliver her baby. Afterwards, he carried out a procedure on her, which the prosecution said was the same as the original FGM she’d undergone. The doctor said he didn’t realise he’d broken the law. Dr Dharmasena said he’d never received any training in dealing with FGM and it was the first time he’d treated a patient who’d undergone it. After the birth, the Trust here launched an investigation and then went to the police. One anti-FGM campaigner, Nimco Ali, believes it’s right this case was tested in the courts. Nobody’s above the law and you cannot necessarily say that we cannot prosecute people that might have committed FGM or people suspect might have committed FGM, and I think that’s a great thing that this case has done that. The law applies like, you know, to everybody and anybody. FGM is practised on some young girls from Africa and the Middle East. It leads to physical and mental problems. It has been illegal in the UK for 30 years but this was the first prosecution. It is being questioned by one senior gynaecologist. Why do I think the case was brought? I think there was a lot of pressure to bring about a successful prosecution for FGM and they were looking around to see if they could find one, but this was not the right one to bring. Tonight the CPS said it was the right decision to put the doctor in the dock. Dr Dharmasena now faces an investigation by the General Medical Council. june Kelly, BBC News. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. Hello, I’m Marc Edwards, and this is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sports Centre. Here’s what we’ve got coming up on the show: Ivory Coast are through to the Africa Cup of Nations Final with a 3-1 win over DR Congo. It’s a landmark appearance for Steven Gerrard - as Liverpool leave it late in their FA Cup tie. And case closed, but at what cost? Rory Mcllroy settles out of court with his former agents. Hello, thanks forjoining us. We’ll have news of Steven Gerrard’s 700th appearance for Liverpool coming up shortly, but we kick off with the Africa Cup of Nations, where Ivory Coast are through to the final after claiming a comfortable 3-1 victory over DR Congo in Bata. The Elephants will now face either Ghana or hosts Equatorial Guinea this weekend after goals from Yaya Toure, Gervinho and Wilfried Kanon helped the 2012 runners up to victory. Our correspondent, Piers Edwards, was soaking in the post match atmosphere, let’s take a listen. Ivory Coast fans are in a joyous mood after reaching their third Africa Cup of Nations finals in six tournaments, making it through beating DR Congo 3-1 with goals from Yaya Toure, Gervinho and Kanon giving them the goals. Having reached the finals, can they finally win their first title since 1992? That would make these finals even more exciting. Let’s see how the fans reacted in ivory cost. I am here with happy fans of the Elephants. How are you feeling? I feel great, fans of the Elephants. How are you feeling? Ifeel great, because feeling? I feel great, because we won, we deserved it and I’m really glad we came that far. You always had the optimism beforehand, you were confident of a win, you got a win? I’m happy and now confident, you know, because I was afraid, because I said we should be careful of this team, because they also have good players, and now that we have won, I’m more than happy. And I expect them to do more at the final. So it’s either Equatorial Guinea or Ghana in the final. Who are you hoping for? Either, we should still keep the determination in our game and we will win the final, for sure! The last time you won was in 1992, that was 20 years ago. Can Ivory Coast really bring the trophy home? Yeah! CHEERING And it’s a happy 700th appearance for Steven Gerrard at Liverpool, as the Reds finally saw off a resolute Bolton side in their FA Cup fourth round replay. However, it was the Trotters who went ahead through former Barcelona striker Eidur Gudjohnsen from the penalty spot. And despite having a man sent off, it looked like the home side would be causing the latest FA Cup upset. But England’s Raheem Sterling popped up to equalise in the 86th minute - before Phillipe Coutinho broke Bolton hearts in injury time to complete a remarkable turnaround. 2-1 to Liverpool, who head to Crystal Palace in the fifth round. It was always going to be a tough game. Lennon has made the team very difficult to beat. We had a lot of chances before they got the penalty and I think you can see on the replay that it was nowhere near penalty. That put us on the backfoot away from home. The players showed the character and spirit within the team. We hit the bar about five or six times, and we had other chances. chances. Eventually we got there in the end. We have a lot of attackers on the field and the quality came through. In Spain, Real Madrid held on to beat Sevilla 2-1 and increase their lead at the top of La Liga to four points on Wednesday. They were without suspended forward Cristiano Ronaldo, but goals from james Rodriguez and substitute jese were enough to see off fourth-placed Sevilla. In Germany, Borussia Dortmund are still bottom of the Bundesliga after losing at home to Augsburg on Wednesday. The only goal of the game was scored early in the second half by Augsburg’s Argentine striker, Raul Bobadilla. They’re up to fourth in the table. But they finished the game with 10 men when Christoph janker’s foul on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang earned him a straight red card. Dortmund remain two points adrift at the foot of the table, much to the disgust of their angry fans. Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller there trying his best to keep them calm. In Italy, Gonzalo Higuain scored the only goal of the game as Napoli beat Inter to reach the last four of the Coppa Italia. They’ll play Lazio in their two-legged semi-final. Rory McIlroy’s multi-million dollar court case against his former Serena Williams has ended her boycott of Indian Wells, 14 years after suffering racist abuse at the tournament. The Australian Open winner has confirmed her attendance at BNP Paribas Open in March. Williams recently beat Maria Sharapova in the final of the Aussie Open last month to earn herself a 19th Grand Slam title. However, the world number one’s last appearance at Indian Wells was back in 2001, when she triumphed to take the title a second time. Rory McIlroy’s multi-million dollar court case against his former agents, Horizon Sports Management, has ended afterjust two days with an out-of-court settlement. Our Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler reports from Dublin. They were once friends and business partners - Rory Mcllroy, the top golfer in the world, and his former agent Horizon Sports Management. A bitter fallout led them to court with those disagreements threatening to become public. Yesterday, instead of the case starting, there were 11th hour negotiations between the sides that lasted long into the night. And today, before the case got under way, there was an announcement of a deal. The dispute between Rory Mcllroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties. We wish each other well in the future. Neither party will be making any further comment. How much money was exchanged? No further comment. It is thought the settlement will see Rory Mcllroy pay Horizon Sports Management many millions - the sum agreed thought to be well over $20 million. Horizon Sports Management secured several money sponsorship deals for him, including one with Nike. Tiger, see? There were fights overseas when Rory McIlroy’s lawyers say the contract was signed on the day with great informality. The Open champion wanted to get the contract ruled invalid and unenforceable, but Horizon countersued for millions of pounds in unpaid fees and breaches of contract. This avoids the eight-week trial in which the financial and legal affairs of one of the best-known sportsmen in the world could have been exposed. Rory Mcllroy was in court yesterday, however he didn’t turn up to the short hearing today. Despite his success, this case has been hanging over Rory Mcllroy. Now it is over, he can concentrate on the course rather than the courts. England’s rugby squad have been training to the sound of hymns and crowd noise, ahead of Friday’s Six Nations opener against Wales. Head coach Stuart Lancaster has admitted arranging for the sounds to be played over loudspeakers in a bid to get his players used to the atmosphere at the Millennium Stadium. Over half the current team have never played at the Welsh national stadium and Lancaster is keen that his side are as prepared for the noise as they can be. Two years ago, England went to Cardiff chasing the Grand Slam but were heavily beaten, which allowed Wales to take the title. We were saying to the players two years ago leading into the game that because of the acoustics of the stadium, because it is so loud, you cannot hear yourself think sometimes. Or at least communicate, more importantly. The on-field communication is about scanning. We wanted to replicate that for those who haven’t been there. just to show the way you communicate with each other nonverbally or whatever else is going to be important, because it is so loud that they can’t hear it sometimes. It was just to replicate that and make sure that we prepare properly this time. Preparation for any international side is meticulous. They have looked at that and learnt from the experience. Likewise, we had the experience many years ago in Twickenham with music blaring, one side of the pitch, and we found it difficult in the warm-up prior to the game. It is about learning from those experiences. They experienced that and they are trying to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. Thousands of New England Patriots fans braved the cold and snowy streets of Boston to welcome back their Superbowl winning heroes. The team rolled through the city in a parade celebrating their last-minute 28 to 24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday’s NFL championship extravaganza. Tom Brady was voted the game’s Most Valuable Player, but had Malcolm Butler to thank for thwarting what seemed like an inevitable victory by Seattle with a goal-line interception with 26 seconds remaining. That’s almost all the time we’ve got left for now, just a quick recap of our top story and Ivory Coast are through to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations for 3rd time since 2006. They comfortably beat DR Congo 3-1 with goals from Yaya Toure, Gervinho and Wilfried Kanon. But from me, Marc Edwards, and the rest of the Sport Today team, bye bye. Hi, there. Cold air is firmly with us at the moment. We’re seeing a few snow flurries to take us into Thursday morning. The cold air not sticking around for too much longer, this dolphin shape of mild air out to the Atlantic is going to take a bite out of the cold, lifting those temperatures back to near normal for the time of year over the next few days. Before we get there, though, it is going to be another pretty cold night with a touch of frost across western areas, a few mist and fog patches here and there, and the cloud will continue to thicken up, bringing showers in off the North Sea, moving into eastern parts of England. Around the coastline, they’re quite likely to fall as rain. But come inland, and we could see sleet or even a little bit of snow, so things could be quite slippery first thing Thursday morning. The amount of snow still pretty difficult to get exactly spot on. Some of us will see the snow really struggling to settle. Others could get perhaps a centimetre, maybe two, in one or two spots. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, though, it’s likely to be a rather cloudy and dull start to the day. That cloud rather low in places and rather misty over the hills, too. Probably the best of any early morning brightness will be across Wales and south west England. There we have those snow showers working in across parts of the Midlands, central-southern England possibly as well. Elevation will certainly help areas like the Chilterns and the Downs perhaps more likely than others to see some heavier bursts of snow fora time. As we head into Thursday afternoon, this cloudy strip of weather is going to work into Wales and south west England, with the snow showers tending to turn back to rain here. Across Kent, there is a chance of seeing a few snow showers here through the afternoon. The skies gradually brightening up across the east. Another fairly chilly day. Temperatures, at best, around five degrees Celsius or so. For Friday, we’ve got this area of low pressure in the Mediterranean, bringing a risk of some flooding rain to the Balkans - some further snowfall across northern Italy and the Alps, particularly. High pressure still across the United Kingdom, but due to the pressure gradient, we’re going to see the winds pick up, and those winds will be bitter winds coming in from the cold continent. Temperatures four or five degrees Celsius, but feeling colder than that due to those brisk winds across England and Wales. The further north you go, the winds are that bit lighter. The temperatures are the same, but it won’t feel quite as cold across more northern stretches. A lot of dry weather, then, to end the week. Here’s Saturday’s chart, you’ll see that milderair coming in off the Atlantic, moving its way down the North Sea. A lot of moisture mixed in with this, so we’re expecting a lot of fairly low cloud, perhaps even a few spots of drizzle, especially towards some of these eastern coasts and hills. Temperature-wise though, for Saturday, we’re looking at temperatures coming back up to near average for the time of year, if not an odd degree above. For the weekend, a lot of cloud around. The weather mostly dry, but not as cold as it has been. ~ Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. I’m Mike Embley. Our top stories: Emergency teams in Taiwan are searching for 12 people missing after the TransAsia plane crash, 31 people are confirmed dead. The journalist Peter Greste says his two Aljazeera colleagues were happy to see him freed from their jail in Egypt, but leaving them behind was extremely difficult. It was tough, you know? We’d discussed this prospect, we knew that there was always a chance that one of us would leave and the others would have to stay - that doesn’t make it any easier. King Abdullah ofjordan promises a ""relentless war"" against the jihadists of the group Islamic State, for burning alive a captured jordanian pilot. Swopping bitcoins for hard time - the mastermind of a $200 million online drugs empire is found guilty by a court in New York. Hello. From behind the windscreens of cars making the everyday crossing over a road bridge in Taipei, it was an unbelievable, heartstopping sight. A plane, suddenly, dramatically low and at an impossible angle, clipping the road right in front of them with its wing, then crashing into the river below. At least 31 of the 58 people aboard TransAsia Flight 235 were killed. Investigators in Taiwan have now recovered the black boxes and are examining pictures from drivers’ dashboard cameras. Let’s get the very latest from Cindy Sui who’s at the crash site in Taipei. It isjust It is just extraordinary, many people survived, isn’t it? Yes, it is very amazing that 15 of the 58 people on board the aircraft actually managed to survive this very unusual plane crash. These people, some of them, they were able to construct themselves from their seatbelts, and come out of the aircraft on their own. Local media reported that one of the families, a father, motherand reported that one of the families, a father, mother and a two-year-old boy, they were all able to free themselves. The father basically freed himself first, and then... He was sat across the aisle from his wife and son, he freed her, his wife, and brought his son up from the water. The song wasn’t breathing a lot, he was giving him CPR before rescue workers are -- arrived. -- son. He suffered some fractures. It is amazing, the authorities tell us about the 15 injured, most only suffered minor injuries. Such as cuts and bruises. What indications are you getting of what could have happened here? It seems from the pictures that only one prop was turning. This model of plane has a pretty terrible record, doesn’t it? Definitely, it has been involved in many accidents, the ATR-72 model of aeroplane. It is making up the bulk of the fleet for TransAsia and many airlines. They are cost efficient aeroplanes. It is very popular among many airlines, apparently. Especially in developing countries. just TransAsia alone, in the last 20 years, they’ve had four accidents involving this model of aircraft. The most deadly one was injuly of last year, where 48 58 passengers were killed when a plane crashed after a typhoon. -- 48 of 58. We don’t know in this case (INAUDIBLE) . The accident, whether there was any mechanical problems or human error. That is part of the investigation. The black box has been recovered but it will take a week for experts to retrieve data from the black box. (INAUDIBLE). Thank you. Sorry, I thought we lost the connection. Thank you. Brimming with smiles, Peter Greste, the Australian journalist freed from an Egyptianjail more than 400 days into a seven-yearjail sentence, has given his first formal news conference. He’sjust returned home to Brisbane. Our correspondentjohn Donnison was there. Peter G reste Peter Greste came in, grinning ear to ear, really, flanked by his parents, as well as his brothers, Andrew and Michael. There were huge cheers from journalists waiting there. Many knew him quite well, I think. Generally, he seemed pretty good form. He looked very healthy, he’s lost a few kilos of weight. Certainly pretty upbeat. He talked a bit first of all about what it was like arriving back in Australia last night. It is incredible to be here. Last night was absolutely extraordinary, to walk through the press gang. It was... Unbelievable. I’ve dreamt about this so many times. And the reality is nowhere near what I imagined it to be. It is so much better. This has been an extraordinary... Obviously, really, extraordinary. .. Obviously, really, for everyone. extraordinary... Obviously, really, for everyone. My family, ass, ass reporters. I want to thank everyone who’s been involved in this campaign. He said that in Cairo, he was treated with dignity and respect. He did not want to go into detail about the conditions, he has to be careful with a number of his colleagues still being held, he talked about how he tried to stay mentally and physically strong. I knew, particularly because it was near the end of the process, we weren’t sure how or when it would end. So, we needed to prepare for the long haul. I know from my readings and experience with the people doing stories on other people who have been through pretty difficult times, that to get through it, you need to be fit. That’s notjust physically, but mentally and intellectually. And spiritually fit. My colleagues and I made a deliberate effort at staying physically fit. We had some limited space, but we made sure that we worked out, and kept ourselves healthy. So, they were exercising daily. He said he started a Masters in International relations while he was inside the prison, as well as doing meditation. Of course, he was asked about his colleagues. He said it was incredibly difficult to say goodbye to them, he simply hugged them and said ""see you when I see you"". He is keen to keep up the campaign and momentum going so that those two are released as soon as possible. Having talked it through, we understood what the circumstances were, and they are all very happy for me. You can imagine after 400 daysin for me. You can imagine after 400 days in prison, with these guys, we are very close. It was very difficult to leave them behind. But, I’m grateful to be out, and I trust that they will follow in due course. It will take time, it will take some further efforts, but we will see them out. Peter Greste delivering a serious message there, but at the same time, there was quite a lot of humour today. same time, there was quite a lot of humourtoday. He humour today. He was asked whether he would buy the first round of beers for his family tonight, and his brother Andrew chipped in, saying"" he will buy them for a four-year!"" He was asked if he would go back to journalism, four-year!"" He was asked if he would go back tojournalism, he looked four-year!"" He was asked if he would go back to journalism, he looked at his mother, saying ""avert your ears"". He said he was born to be a correspondent and that’s what he intends to carry on doing. -- for a year. Injordan, King Abdullah has declared what he’s calling a relentless war against the jihadists of the group Islamic State, on their own territory. He was speaking just a day after the images appeared of a jordanian pilot being burned to death by IS. Within hours, jordan announced it had executed two al-Qaeda militants and said it would now play a larger part in the American-led military coalition against the extremists. Paul Adams reports from the pilot’s home village injordan. Far from jordan’s capital, in the peaceful hills above the Dead Sea, the very public rituals of condolences. This is the hometown ofjordan’s murdered pilot. A magnet now for thousands of people anxious to pay their respects. A chance to share the family’s grief, to embrace, to pray, and grapple with the sheer horror of what’s happened. Moaz al-Kasasbeh’s father will spend much of the next three days here in this tent. In that time, he’ll meet a great many well-wishers, but he’ll also hear a great number of questions. How, if at all, canjordan punish those responsible for his son’s death? What should the country’s role be in the US-led coalition against Islamic State? You said last week that you were not sure that this was jordan’s fight. Do you still feel that way today? TRANSLATION: I am now certain that jordan must fight them in their hideouts. Outside our borders because they are coming for us. We must fight them before they reach us. But before that, a gesture of revenge. This nondescript pre-dawn convoy carrying the bodies of two Al-Qaeda prisoners. Their longstanding death penalties now carried out. Later, on the road to the airport, displays of solidarity and defiance as King Abdullah returned home from Washington. This was hardly spontaneous, but as the King swept through it was heartfelt. This small country rallying together at a time of wounded pride. jordan says it is fighting back. The King, meeting security officials, spoke of a relentless war to protect faith, values and human principles. The government says it’s increasing its participation in the US-led coalition, but how far? Nobody was talking about ground troops. We’re talking about helping the Iraqi military. about helping the Syrian moderate opposition, or Peshmerga troops, in order to fight on the ground. The soldiers who come to offer their condolences don’t expect to be thrust into the fight, but the trauma of the past 10-days has brought the battle against Islamic State that much closer. Paul Adams, BBC News, jordan. Reports from Libya say a number of workers, including foreign nationals, were killed at a remote oilfield in an attack on Tuesday night. A senior military official at the Mabrook oilfield said 12 died, with most beheaded and some shot. Eyewitness reports suggest the gunmen described themselves as members of Islamic State. The chief executive of Brazil’s state-run oil giant Petrobras, has resigned in the wake of a major corruption scandal. As well as Maria das Gracas Foster, five other executives also stepped down. Prosecutors say the scandal involved around $800 million dollars in bribes and other illegal funds. China’s internet watchdog has banned web users from posting messages under the names of famous people. It said it was combating the ""vulgar culture"" of using names like Barack Obama, or those of Chinese officials. Also, nicknames should not include information that could subvert state power, undermine national security or promote rumour-mongering. US Secretary of State john Kerry is in Kiev today highlighting support for Ukraine and discussing the the possibility of arming government forces there. President Obama’s pick for the next US Secretary of Defence says he’d be inclined to send support, including lethal arms, to Ukrainian forces. Ashton Carter was speaking during his Senate confirmation hearing in an exchange with Senatorjohn McCain. Do you believe that we should be supplying arms, defensive arms, two Ukrainians? Ivery supplying arms, defensive arms, two Ukrainians? I very much in that direction, Mr Chairman, because I think we have to support the Ukrainians in defending themselves -- to. The nature of those arms, I cannot say right now, because I do not have confirmation with our military leaders or Ukrainian leaders. But I’m inclined in the direction of providing them with arms, including lethalarms. Ashton Carter during his confirmation hearing to become the next US defence secretary there. And his comments came as fighting in eastern Ukraine claimed the lives of at least four more people when an artillery shell hit near a hospital in the rebel held city of Donetsk. Violence has increased in recent weeks as the separatists try to encircle the key town of Debaltseve which is controlled by government troops. In another response to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, Nato Defence Ministers are meeting in Brussels this morning. They’re set to announce plans to substantially reinforce NATO’s presence in eastern Europe. jens Stoltenberg, the organisation’s Secretary General has called it the biggest reinforcement since the end of the Cold War.

The mastermind of the website known as Silk Road has been convicted in a New York court. Ross Ulbricht was found guilty on all seven counts for his role in a scheme that enabled around $200 million worth of online drug sales using the anonymous payment system Bitcoin. Nick Bryant reports from New York. This was the website that fast became the biggest online marketplace for illegal drugs in the world. Silk Road’s menu of narcotics included heroin, cocaine and LSD and before being shut down by the FBI in 2013, it generated over $200 million in business - all conducted with the electronic currency Bitcoins, which granted customers anonymity. The FBI calls it the most sophisticated criminal marketplace on the internet. It’s creator, 30-year-old Ross Ulbricht, looks like a typical dot comm entrepreneur. But he was the king pin of a digital drug empire run from his laptop. Adopting the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, his market was notjust the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, his market was not just a street or neighbourhood, but the entire world. He used what’s call the dark web network where layers of encryption and thousands of relays made him hard to trace. So determined was Ross Ulbricht that his website should remain in the shadows that prosecutors alleged he hired hit men who threatened to disclose information on his customers and vendors. There is no evidence that the murders were carried out - but the evidence that the murders were carried out- but the government says it shows that, for all his technical know-how, he acted like a traditional drug baron. Ulbricht was arrested at this library in San Francisco, chatting with what he thought was a colleague but was in fact a FBI federal agent. They tracked him down after he offered a Gmaim address offering advice on how to access the Silk Road. When that actually hits the ground and you start working with other individuals and you start paying bills to support your criminal enterprise, those all create traces of evidence that law enforcement can use to catch you. He could face a sentence of life imprisonment but the guilty verdict already sends a powerful message - that the darker recesses of the internet offer no immunity from arrest. The European Central Bank has added to the pressure on the new Greek government, saying it will no longer accept its bonds as collateral for lending money to commercial banks. Greece is hoping to renegotiate its bailout with the rest of the Eurozone. Its Finance Ministry has said the Central Bank decision will have ‘no adverse impact’ on its financial system. BBC Economics Correspondent Duncan Weldon explains exactly what the ECB has done. Greek government bonds and government debt has been classified as junk for years. It has been seen as not very safe. Despite being classified asjunk, this is the technical bit, the European Central Bank has had a waiver in place so that Greek banks can take thisjunk-rated debt and get cheap funding in return. What the European Central Bank has said unexpectedly - and earlier than we thought would come - is that, from next week, they won’t accept Greek government debt. That’s a problem because the Greek banks are the weak spot of the Greek ECOFIOITIV. What’s been happening overjanuary and December is deposits have been pulled out - lots of deposits. I hesitate to say there is a run on Greek banks, but there is certainly a briskjog on Greek banks and this doesn’t help. They can still get emergency liquidity support, but that is more difficult and adds pressure on Greek banks and this would accelerate deposit outflow and they are looking quite ropey. The 90-year-old President of Zimbabwe has fallen over in public. Robert Mugabe had been speaking to supporters from a podium in the capital Harare and was walking to his car when he appeared to miss a step and toppled. His aides quickly helped him up and escorted him to his limousine. Some of the photographers who captured the fall said they were forced to delete their pictures by security personnel. Mugabe’s spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

If you’ve ever found a valuable antique in your garage, you’ll know how it feels. Well, imagine finding a car collection worth millions that had been left hidden away for 50 years. That’s what has happened in France, as Ben Bland reports. Rusty, broken, covered in dust- and worth millions. 60 vintage cars that have been hidden away for half a century - now discovered in the grounds of a remote French castle, thanks to a single phone call. The granddaughter of the late collector told an auction house she had a Ferrari 250 California. When the valuer arrived, Ferrari 250 California. When the valuerarrived, he valuer arrived, he couldn’t believe what else he found. The whole collection is estimated between 12 million and 15 million Euros, but we hope to reach, maybe, over 20 million Euros - that would be good, because really it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy restorable lifetime opportunity to buy restora ble cars from lifetime opportunity to buy restorable cars from the 40s and 50s. The collection of cars has gone on display at a Paris exhibition centre and they’re up for sale on Friday. An exciting opportunity if you’re good with engines - and have a million or two to spare. What are your loves and fears? It’s a very personal question, but if you walk around one neighbourhood in the US capital Washington, you’ll find that local residents are listing them publicly for all to see. Photographer Susan Raab is behind the project in Anacostia, which she says is designed to give a voice and representation to all the people of the city. ~ Icame up I came up with this idea of taking portraits of people and asking them to write down their loves and fears. The idea being that I would then make posters out of these photographs and the objects of their writing, and post them around the city, and sort of share the faces of people and their vulnerabilities, or as much of their vulnerabilities as they chose to express, in a way that we could may be see commonalities and differences. My neighbourhood has probably some of the richest people in America living in it, and then I work in a neighbourhood that has some of the poorest people in America. All within the confines of the district line. There’s sort of a cultural bias - there’s a way of thinking about Anacostia as a very poor, disenfranchised urban community which belies a lot of its very obvious humanity and wonderful quirkiness. So as we developed this project, I thought, quirkiness. So as we developed this project, Ithought, well, maybe I can develop an Instagram feed for it, using the hashtags loves and fears and we’re all in this together, because that’s also a popular hashtag. But being a tactile 4 by 5 colour negative photographer I’m always looking for opportunities for people to have this analog and to be able to touch and feel these in their real lives and that’s why I wanted to paste the posters all around town. I think a lot of what I can do as a photograph to help make this world a better place is to show people that they are worthy of representation and acknowledgement, especially if they are overlooked. The response was overwhelmingly positive, showing the work was really grateful, and people were really excited that they had been represented in this way. It’s the size of a bull and scientists say it’s the largest ever rodent ever discovered. Living around two million years ago, it probably used its huge front teeth like tusks. Based on a CT scan of its skull and subsequent computer simulations, its bite was as strong as a tiger - but its front teeth were built to withstand forces nearly three times larger. This suggests that its 30cm incisors were much more than eating implements. Only a single fossilised skull has been found belonging to this South American rodent, which was unearthed in Uruguay in 2007. just briefly a reminder of that main news. Dramatic images have been release of the moments before a TransAsia aeroplane clipped a bridge and crashed into a river in Taipei. 31 people were killed. Emergency workers are still searching for 12 people missing and you are just seeing the live shots there from Taipei. Much more on the BBC website and Twitter, thank you for watching. Cold air is with us at the moment with snow showers taking us into Thursday. That will change in the next few days as this mild air takes a bite out of the cold, lifting temperatures close to where they should be for the time of year. Before we get there, overnight will be cold. Some frost around, mist and fog patches and showers coming across eastern England from the North Sea, falling as rain to the coast. However, inland, you may see sleet and snow in those showers. We start the day on a slippery note for some places. Scotland and Northern Ireland start on a cloudy note, some cloud will be low with mist over the hills. Brightness across Wales and south-west England and wintry showers moving in across the Midlands, central, southern England and the south-east. Don’t be surprised to see snow in those showers. Over the hills, a little bit of snow settling with one or two centimetres in the snowiest places. Through Thursday it will cloud over across Wales and the south-west of England with snow showers turning back to rain through the afternoon. There could be snow showers affecting parts of Kent. The skies gradually brighten across eastern England. Still chilly, around five degrees. Here is Friday’s weather. Low pressure in the Mediterranean brings stormy weather. High pressure for the UK and between, we have the winds picking up, the pressure gradient tightening, driving wind in and that Through Thursday it will cloud over across Wales and the south-west of Some bright spells are expected with some sunshine. Further north, the winds are not as strong, so not feeling as chilly, with temperatures around four or five degrees. Into the weekend, we have high pressure with us and moist air coming around the high-pressure system and down the North Sea, meaning that as we head into the weekend, we expect a lot of cloud, perhaps thick enough for the odd spot of drizzle around some of the coasts and hills across the east and south. The temperatures will come back closer to average, perhaps a degree above. This weekend, expect a lot of cloud, mostly dry weather and certainly not feeling as cold as it has been. You are watching BBC News, I’m Mike Embley. The top stories this hour. Dramatic images have been released of the moments before a Trans-Asia Airways plane clipped a bridge and crashed into a river in Taipei. 31 people were killed and at least 12 others are still missing. The Al jazeera journalist, Peter Greste has given a press conference in Australia. He said his two colleagues, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who are still in an Egyptian prison, were happy for him to be freed but that it was very difficult to leave them behind and he hoped they’d be released soon. King Abdullah ofjordan has declared a relentless war against Islamic State, after images were published of a jordanian pilot being burned to death. He said the blood of Muath al-Kasasbeh would not be shed in vain and jordan would step up its role in the US-led military coalition against IS. More on that and all of the news on the BBC website. Now it’s time for Panorama. A&E’s not well. There’s times when I feel like halfway through a shift, just walking out, because the pressure is that much. Accident & Emergency, the sharp end of the NHS. Record numbers through an ever-open door. From a whole hospital point of view, this is the worst year we’ve had. Elderly patients stuck in hospital, a system under stress. I want to go home. I know you do, darling. I know you do. So many patients that targets are missed. When you’re doing everything you can and you are still not hitting your targets, it is frustrating. And doctors issue a warning: We are broken. We have reached our capacity. There is no more give. Accident & Emergency has been in crisis and in the news. Emergency units in England are coming under extra pressure because of a big rise in the number of patients... Hospitals in England have declared... Accidents and emergency doctors say they’re treating 20,000 more patients a week... So what’s going on? Last winter we spent seven days in A&E at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton. It was busy. But it was meeting targets. Last month, we went back. Across on three. One, two, three. Bill, that’s it. You’re doing really well. It’s a lot busier than last year. Everybody’s under a lot of strain. There’s a lot of stress going on in the place. Everybody’s trying their best and running around. Sometimes you feel that you’re not getting anywhere. We filmed here a year ago, coming back, it feels like a different place. A year, it seems, is a long time in A&E. A&E staff tell you that the initials really stand for ""anything and everything"", from a crushed finger. Fair bit of blood went. He didn’t like the way the end of my finger was kind of loose. To Princess Fiona with a nose bleed. My friend rung the NHS line. The girl on the phone asked if I had any colour in my cheeks. I said, ""I can’t answer that at the minute, because I’m green."" Winter set in the week we were here. Has she been pain free? It’s the morning meeting in the nurses’ station, the nerve centre of the department. The clinical director, Andy Simpson, takes the lead, reviewing current cases. Next is... She tripped in the garden this morning trying to put some grit. She’s right handed, had a fractured wrist. OK, slipped, RTC. Winter always leads to extra business for A&E. What’s happened to you? Slipped on the ice. Yes. And fell onto my back. But the falls and winter bugs are no worse than usual. Throughout the NHS, the pressure started growing long before it got cold. This winter, we never really got out of the pressures of last winter. Normally, in the summer, we would see an improvement in performance because the number of people who require admission to hospital, particularly the frail, the elderly and those with breathing problems goes down. This year, we never really got that recovery. Year on year, the demand has increased. This is what’s been changing in A&E, the record number of the frail and elderly they’re treating. Can I grab a syringe, ten mls. In adjoining bays, Raymond Smith, who’s 73, and Bill Wilson, who’s 85. Raymond was brought in by a carer from his residential home. He’s having severe breathing difficulties. Last year, the total number of patients of all ages arriving at A&E departments in England, like this one, was 14,600,000. That’s an increase of 3% on the previous year, which does not sound an awful lot. But it’s equivalent to the number of patients that would be seen by seven medium-sized emergency departments. Now we haven’t built or staffed seven more emergency departments in the last 12 months. We have a rather unwell gentleman in resus, at the moment. He’s come in septic into resus. Elderly patients often have complex needs. infection. Do you mind coming down? Is that all right? Losing an arm, OK, got it. Bill’s family are anxious to see him. And to know how he is. We’re trying to figure this out. He’s been in and out of here since August. They’ve done everything they can to help him. He’s been in and out of hospital, and because of that, you’ve been in and out of hospital too. That’s been your life? It’s what you’ve got to do, there’s not a lot else you can do. This evening, treating a procession of the frail and elderly, is that unusual? That’s a normal situation. I would expect to see a situation like that on every shift, sometimes several times. Sometimes you’d never leave resus, just be going from one patient to another to another. I’ve been qualified for 25 years. I’ve been consultant for 15 years. From an A&E point of view, this is the worst year we’ve ever had. Raymond was admitted to a ward, but died soon afterwards. Bill died within days. Many elderly patients towards the end of their lives may have repeated visits to A&E. What we need to look at is long-term planning for people, because we are getting people from nursing homes, who really don’t want to come to hospital. We have had people come to Accident & Emergency and they’ve died in the Accident & Emergency department. It is not a nice place to end up dying. The public never sees the stress A&E staff work under every day. You can hear the crying in the background? Sometimes we wish we could share with people in the waiting area, because all they see is nothing happening, but in actual fact, we’re busy trying to resuscitate people, behind closed doors. We come out of there exhausted to see them with their sprained ankle. I’ve trapped my thumb in a door. I think it’s broken or got infected. I’ve been here for hours and nobody’s bothered to tell me anything. There’s lots of doctors and nurses treating people who are much more severely unwell back there. Oh, yeah, I understand that completely. Other people have been in and out within five or ten minutes, that’s all. According to official figures, about 40% of the people arriving at A&Es could have been treated elsewhere. People who are using the NHS the way it wasn’t designed to be used. They want now, instant fix. They want it done yesterday. They don’t care who does it. They want it done now. A&E is open for business 24/7. Some staff told us that they thought the NHS’s new 111 phone advice system was sending too many patients into A&E. Would you consider yourself severely ill? What have you been able to do today? My view is that we get too many patients sent to Accident & Emergency via 111. The whole point of 111 was to actually send patients to different place rather than Accident & Emergency. Isn’t 111, which is meant to be part of the solution, part of the problem? Categorically not. More people are phoning 111 in a year than going to A&E departments. What we know is that of those people who phone 111, who would otherwise have dialled 999 for an ambulance or gone to A&E, 60% are now offered a treatment that is better and actually avoids them doing either of those things. 111 can only refer people to other parts of the NHS, if they’re open. Sometimes, especially at the weekend, there may be no alternative to A&E. This is not to blame 111, this is a call to increase the number of services and the numbers of days per week those services are available so that NHS 111 can direct people to the most appropriate place, not the only available place. That is broke and it should be put in a cast. Patients who are drunk and abusive are part of the daily round in A&E. Mostly staff grin and bear it, but not always. This is the third time I’ve been treated like this. Last time she come in, she was verbally abusive because we wouldn’t get her transport home. She was very intoxicated. We got the police to escort her off the department. Sister Nicola Donachie has been in A&E for 18 years. She says she’s never been worked so hard. Very low tolerance to her staying, if she’s going to be abusive again. Zero tolerance. Are you going to be quiet? I will be quiet, but I don’t want to talk to you. I’m not going to treat you. Take me back to the police station. You caused this injury by kicking the door. Exactly. Not only are they drunk, nine times out of ten, they’re not very nice drunks either. We get a lot of abuse from them. just down the corridor, a patient has been brought in with a head injury. As soon as I’ve treated you... How’s it going to be?! She’d been drinking too. Who’s you? Iwant Gregg! I can hear you three doors down. I’m hungry, officer. All I want is a little cheese sandwich. What’s the problem? I haven’t got a problem. Scenes like this are nothing unusual in A&E. The NHS in England estimates the total cost of harm from alcohol at £3.5 billion a year. And hospital admissions are rising. Nice and still for me, Stuart. Stuart, just relax. Until they’re sober, they haven’t got capacity. They can’t make judgements for themselves. We have to keep them in hospital until they’re sober. It’s the morning after. Stuart spent the night on a ward. He’s sobered up. Have you got a problem with alcohol? Yes. Are you an alcoholic? Yeah. It takes a fair bit of all their time, doesn’t it, when you come in? i SUppoSâ So, yâ8i’I. It does, yes. A&E departments also see people with mental health problems. Some turn up so often staff call them ""regulars"". Sister Donachie knows this patient well. Oh, bless you. You two have got to know each other well over the years. What do you usually bring me? Bag of sweets. Have you been here before? Yeah, many, many times. Can you give me some idea of how many times, five, six, ten? About 120. What’s brought you here? It’s either been pain. I suffer with a lot of pain. I’ve done a lot of damage over the years. This isn’t a social network, it’s a hospital. No, I think it is a social network. We become friends. I think they come because they’re lonely and they have nowhere else to go, the majority of them. Could you imagine your life without coming here? Yeah. You could? I’ve done that for the past eight weeks. But that’s not that long. It is for me. That’s very, very good for me. In Stockton, we saw A&E staff treating old people with complex medical needs, but we saw something else as well. Elderly people arriving not because they’re ill, but because those caring for them can no longer cope. It is Saturday night. Kathleen has been brought in. She is 89, and lives at home with her daughters. Sorry, Nick, can we get a bed for Kathleen in room six, please? Your mother lost her husband a few months ago? We lost my dad seven months ago. And you are worried that your mother has not been eating? YES, VâI’y ITIUCi’I So. You have been unhappy? My family has made me happy, but I have not been happy myself, really. And that is why you have not been eating? I would say that, yes. Do you think you did the right thing? Yes. By calling 999 on a Saturday night and bring her to this hospital? Couldn’t cope. Not the way she was tonight. Kathleen is not ill, but she has come to a place for the acutely unwell. The A&E doctor focuses on her social welfare. We can’t do anything now. Come morning, we will get some people to look at you, and they will see what you can do at home and what you can’t do and what kind of help you need, all right? And maybe we can sort out some carers to make it easier. You are not a burden on yourfamily, so I don’t want you thinking that. Itjust might make it easier at home for you and everyone. Thank you very much. That is all right. Has anyone told you what nice white teeth you have got? Thanks, no one has told me that. Stop flattering me! In the small hours of the following morning, another patient arrives at A&E who no one thinks is ill. If we left him at home, he is not eating and it is possible that he would not have made it. They tried to get social workers involved, and all that, to help out. This is George, as you know. Hi, George. He is a bit deaf. A young friend of his has brought him in. So why tonight, all of a sudden? He never goes into the shower. His room is minging. I try to get him in the shower, and he just punches us. I am just going to pop these stickers on you, George, OK? Nice and still, George. George, who has not had an accident or an emergency, has become A&E’s business nonetheless. He is just very deaf. I would say he has got capacity. He will need the help of social services, but for now, it is the NHS that work out for him. Is he here because he is ill? No. He does not seem to have any medical problems. Like a baby in a basket, he has been brought here in the small hours of the morning? Yeah. And he will be admitted into a hospital bed, probably. But that is not going to be easy. Beds throughout the hospital are at a premium. The skills of the bed management team have never been needed more. He is allocated to an empty bed, Karen. Have you ever known this hospital this full before? In my time, I have not seen so many extra beds open, no. They have opened up 56 extra beds, but they are full as well. Can I get an update, please? Her business is freeing up beds, and she hands them down throughout the hospital. How far do you think you walk everyday? Not sure. Maybe a couple of miles, I guess. Hello? It is Carolyn. I’m just after the side room that is coming up. Oh, what is there a change in the plan? Anything else coming up? It is very stressful. Obviously, you are worrying about getting patients home before it gets too late. And you are also worried about the patients that are on their way in and that you need to create capacity for. Often, a hospital bed that could otherwise be free is occupied by an elderly patient who no longer needs hospital care. Mum, have a drink. Well done. jane Abraham has dementia. She was admitted straight onto a hospital ward from her care home. # Our hearts are on fire. She was well enough to leave hospital before Christmas, but in mid-january, she is still here. There is a tiny bit left. Prolonged hospital admissions are costly and also costly to jane, because she is at risk of infectionsjust from being in hospital. We can only protect her so much. I want to go home. We will, as soon as you are strong. But because jane’s medical and nursing needs have increased, she can’t go back to the care home where she lived before. And this is where a hospital can become reliant on the actions of others - social services and families themselves. We are an acute ward. WE BFE VâI’y busy. In a nursing home, it will obviously be more relaxed. Her daughters have been struggling to find a new care home. We are really concerned about my mother. We desperately want her out of here. I feel like there is a big block between the NHS and what happens to somebody afterwards. They spend hours on the phone and the internet, trying to find a suitable home for their mother. It is unfamiliar and stressful work. Could I speak to the manager, please? It is Bridget Lowry about jane Abraham. We have been ringing the various organisations to try and get it sorted. It has been a long haul. So it is definitely not going to be today? Could it be tomorrow, possibly? Thanks very much. Bye - bye. The family think they should have had more help from social services, but the local authority insist that they have done everything that was required of them. Can you see my dad? The hospital admits that a failure in communication on its part has contributed to the delay. In another room in the same ward is George. He is the old fellow whose friends thought he could not look after himself at home. How are you feeling? Champion. You can’t do better than that. So what are things like for George at home? With his permission, I went to look at his room. This is where he has been living for years. It is not difficult to see why his friends think he can’t cope. Meanwhile, until everyone sorts out what to do about him, he is being cared for by the NHS. Enjoy your meal. More than a quarter of the days that patients spending hospital in England after they are medically fit to leave are down to arranging social care. There is a disconnect between NHS and social services, and that hurts pressured hospitals. It is not a disconnect, there is a good connection, but it has got to be better. Social care have had a tougher time than we have, and we recognise that the ability for the health system to be efficient is dependent on the social care and community services. That is why extra money has been put into that by the government. The harder it is to get patients out of hospital, the more the trafficjam tails back to an already overstretched A&E. Yet the staff are still meant to meet the same official waiting time targets, treating and then admitting or discharging 95% of their patients within four hours. You are doing everything you can and everybody is pulling together, and you are still not hitting your targets. It is frustrating. Last year, we saw staff busting a gut to keep the red warning light is off the computer screen and meet the target, and they were succeeding. But now, week by week, like many hospitals, Stockton is failing. For the last quarter, we have just managed to achieve the target of 95%. But on some days, we do fail and have too many breaches. In this quarter, barring a miracle, you will fail. What does it feel like to give it your best shot and still know you are heading for failure? Well, nobody likes to fail. We do our best to achieve the target, but if we do fail, it will not be for lack of trying. Some staff sounded quite unapologetic about failing to meet the targets. You are ""failing"". Yeah, and I think that is a good thing. It is good that you are failing? If no one knows how bad the situation is, how on earth will we get help? If the system is broken, we want that to be highlighted. But is the increased pressure on A&E departments causing not just a failure to meet targets, but something more serious? Here on the A&E front line, they are worried about whether they can continue to do theirjob properly. We have all felt that danger of there being someone in the department who might be unwell, and we might not have a handle on exactly how unwell they are simply because we are spread so thin. The clinical director in A&E is worried about patient safety as well. Once you have overloaded a system to a point where you have no beds in the hospital, where you have no rooms left in resus and people are still coming, you must put people at risk in some way. When a service is under pressure, that is inevitable, but nevertheless, we do make sure we have the staff thing we need in place to make sure that most patients, when they come into hospital, are not put at risk. Stockton is officially recognised as a good hospital. Its frail and elderly patients, who are arriving and being admitted in such numbers, are treated with great care. We are going to go home. After over a month in hospital, jane Abraham left to go to a new care home her daughters had found for her. Kathleen, admitted into A&E on Saturday night, is now in the hospital’s rehabilitation unit. You are going to start doing your exercises that the physio is giving you. I will tell you one thing. She is bossy. Mum is a lot better. George, brought in because he was not coping on his own, is still in hospital while his future care needs are sorted out. But even this good hospital is labouring under heavy burdens, and its staff in A&E say they can’t take much more. There are times when I feel like, halfway through a shift, just walking out, because the pressure is that much. Would you have said a year ago, there are times halfway through my shift when I feel like chucking it in? No. The man in charge of acute care in England says reform has already begun. We are trying very hard to make sure that the system is coping, and I believe the NHS is currently coping, but we have an unsustainable system, and I agree that it is something that will have to change. Because the patients are being put at risk? Because the system demand means that at the moment, the model we have to deliver care will increasingly find it difficult to do safe care. We are broken. We have reached our capacity. There is no more give. So the diagnosis at the end of a week in A&E is clear. This most exposed and politically sensitive part of the NHS is in need of urgent Care. Push Hello, you’re watching BBC World News. I’m Adnan Nawaz. Our top story this hour: NATO defence ministers are expected to boost troop numbers in Eastern Europe in response to the growing crisis in Ukraine. The US Secretary of State, john Kerry, is in Kiev today to discuss the possible arming of Ukrainian government forces. Welcome to the programme. Other stories that we are keeping across for you: Greece’s new finance minister heads to Berlin to meet his German counterpart, but will this be the toughest part of his European tour? The journalist Peter Greste says his two Aljazeera colleagues were happy to see him freed from their jail in Egypt, but leaving them behind was extremely difficult. I’m Sally Bu ndock. In business, piling on the pressure. The ECB cuts off cheap funding to Greek banks, citing concerns about Greece’s commitment to its bailout pledges. Plus, fast, fairand open - can new US rules level the playing field for the internet business? NATO’s Secretary-General has called it the biggest reinforcement of its collective defence since the end of the Cold War. NATO defence ministers will announce plans to reinforce its presence in eastern Europe in response to the crisis in Ukraine. The American Secretary of State, john Kerry, is due in Kiev later amid speculation the United States is considering providing weapons to Ukrainian government forces. Nato defence ministers will be meeting in Brussels, where they plan to announce an increased military presence in Eastern Europe. Ben Bland reports. For many in eastern Ukraine, this sort of destruction has become part of everyday life. This is Donetsk, a town controlled by pro-Russia separatists. When a shell hit a hospital here, at least three people were killed and many others wounded. Even in areas controlled by the Ukrainian government, people have felt it is too dangerous to stay. This town is held by Ukrainian troops and under fire from the rebels. This man has chosen to stay. What else can I do, he asks. He has become so used to the shelling, notice how he doesn’t even flinch with an explosion nearby. The US Secretary of State, john Kerry, is due to visit Kiev on Thursday. So far, the US has provided only nonlethal assistance to Ukraine, such as radios and night vision goggles. The incoming defence secretary hinted they might go further. I think we need to support the Ukrainians in defending themselves. The nature of those arms I can’t say right now, but I’m inclined in the direction of providing them with arms, including to get to what I -- get to what I’m sure your question is, Leith alarms. We carry on with the sanctions but at the same time we must avoid the confrontation of a situation that is worsening and could lead to further problems. France and Germany are working together to find a solution. We have no intention to provide lethal weapon is right now. Meanwhile, in response to the situation in Ukraine, Nato is expected to announce plans for a new rapid reaction force of 4000 troops. I’ve used to its presence in Eastern Europe in case of any potential threat from Russia. Moscow denies supporting or army and the separatist rebels in Ukraine, in a conflict that has already killed more than 5000 people. The European Central Bank has added to the pressure on the new Greek government by saying it will no longer accept its bonds as collateral for lending money to the country’s commercial banks. The move comes as Greece seeks to renegotiate its bailout with the rest of the eurozone. The new Greek finance minister is due to meet his German counterpart in Berlin this Thursday. jenny Hill reports from Berlin. Every day they dish out Greek food for hungry Germans. Little appetite here for austerity. Theodore is Greek. Country needs now, she tells me, is a new start. The Greeks don’t want a bid to help, she says, they want help that are voluntarily and in friendship. They don’t want to be blackmailed, they want help so they can grow. She would get on well with Dennis. It is important that they have time to get back on their feet again, so we should prolong their debt to repay, there should be no cut. They must become economically healthy and then they can pay. The mood in Germany is pretty unrelenting. Senior politicians and economists are clear. We have bent over backwards for Greece already, we argue. There will be no debt relief. Officially, the line from Angela Merkel is let’s wait and see what Greece really wants. Today’s meeting is likely to be tense, if only because here in the eurozone what Germany says really matters. The Greeks have made their choice. They went to the polls and voted for a new government, this is their right, it is democracy. What is not right is that now the new government runs around in Europe and says, when need some people who have paid for the promises. Most of Greece says, this is unacceptable, we are going to leave the eurozone. This would be the best thing for both sides. For now, they wait to see what Greece wants, what Germany will give, and what kind of concessions it will demand in return. Is this the hard ball we have been talking about for a few days? Surely that would affect Greece’s internal bank if they can’t get that money? It does affect them, but there are different opinions as to how badly it will affect and what will happen in the short term. I think the Greeks think they can ride this for a short period of time. But the jury is out. We are seeing losses on some markets around the world because of that news from the European Central bank. As you’ve been hearing, Thursday is a critical day for Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, as he heads to Berlin to meet his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble. On Wednesday Mr Varoufakis was in Frankfurt at the European Central Bank trying to drum up support. It seems he didn’t reassure the lender. Infact, quite the opposite. Late on Wednesday evening the ECB unexpectedly toughened its stance on Greece. It said it would no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral against loans to Greek banks. It cited doubts about Greece’s commitment to its bailout terms Greek banks had relied heavily on cheap loans from the ECB. This move will increase their borrowing costs and pile OI’! ti’Iâ pI’âSSUI’â. Greek markets are expected to be hit hard today. A fund of Greek shares plunged more than 10% in New York. And the euro sank almost 1.25%. We will be talking about the political risk, to a consultant based in Berlin, about this latest step. ""The Internet must be fast, fairand open"". That’s the call from US Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler. He’s pushing for a shake-up of rules governing internet service providers to protect so called net neutrality making sure all web traffic is treated equally. They would effectively stop ISPs giving preferential treatment to some websites over others. The rules would mean no blocking of access to any legal content, applications, or services. No throttling, or slowing down access to, any content, and no paid prioritization, or favouring of some traffic in exchange for consideration. We will also have a story about China jumping on the stimulus bandwagon.

Full of the smiles that come with liberty, Peter Greste, the Australian journalist who was freed from an Egyptianjail after 400 days, has given his first formal news conference. It took place shortly after he arrived home in his home town of Brisbane. jon Donnison was at the press conference in Brisbane. Obviously I feel quite concerned. Part of me feels maybe you should have dug my heels in and out of solidarity. It would have been the wrong choice. I don’t know what was involved in the negotiations, I was just told it was time to go. When did it sink in? I think when I got out at the airport. I was given an armed escort all the way to the airport. That is not the way these things usually work. At the airport they said, goodbye, you are on your own. Shook my hand. Australian embassy officials took me from their, and there was a ministry of information officials, and I thought, maybe this really is happening. We made a very conscious effort to look after ourselves. Physically, intellectually, spiritually. I tried very hard to keep fit. We set up a fitness programme for ourselves. We did the sorts of things that everyone promises they are going to do every New Year’s Eve, but we stuck it out because we knew that our lives depended on it, our sanity depended on it. It really wasn’t untill depended on it, our sanity depended on it. It really wasn’t until I walk through that door and saw this vast throng, this gaggle of cameras and lights and people, thatjust blew my mind. That was a moment I was really craving. That was when I had my emotionalfreedom. It was extraordinary. I knew that obviously this was getting some attention that I had no idea whatsoever that it was this big. That people were reacting to it is massively as they have done. What did your parents say? When I saw them, mum smacked me over the year and told me not to do it again. Stay with us on BBC News.

After speaking to supporters from a podium in the capital Harare, Robert Mugabe was walking to his car when he appeared to miss a step and toppled. His aides quickly helped him up and escorted him to his limousine. Mugabe’s spokesman was not immediately available for comment. This is BBC World News. The latest headlines: Ukraine’s allies consider more military support as one small town is battered by new fighting. jubliant Aljazeera journalist Peter Greste is home at last in Australia, but he continues fighting for his colleagues still injail in Egypt. From behind the windscreens of cars making an everyday crossing over a bridge in Taipei, it was an unbelievable, heartstopping sight. A plane, suddenly, dramatically low, and at an impossible angle, clipping the road right in front of them, and then crashing into the river below. Investigators in Taiwan have now recovered the black boxes from the plane, and are examining pictures from drivers’ dashboard cameras. Taiwan, Taipei, drivers see something for you from the sky. The twin propeller plane with 58 on-board appears to have suffered a sudden loss of power shortly after takeoff -- sudden loss of power shortly after takeoff-- falling from the sky. Another car with a dashboard camera was even closer. The plain wingtip can be seen striking the roof of a taxi. The plane finally came to rest upside down and broken in a shallow river. That anyone could survive may seem extraordinary but 15 were rescued, including a two-year-old boy. By nightfall they had located the cockpit. The last recorded words from the flight deck had been, May Day, May Day, engine flame out. While the work is continuing to have brought in lifting gear and you can see the plane has been brought out onto the riverbank. There are still some submerged sections where bodies could be trapped at after so long in the water this isn’t a rescue mission, at a recovery operation. This is the second fatal accident for the Taiwan -based TransAsia Airways in less than a year-- but. The black boxes hold the key as to why, in good weather, a relatively new plane with experienced pilots appears tojust fall new plane with experienced pilots appears to just fall out of the sky. King Abdullah ofjordan has declared, what he called, a relentless war against the extremists of Islamic State, on their own territory. He was speaking a day after images were published of Muath al-Kasasbeh, a jordanian Air Force pilot, being burned to death by the group. Within hours, jordan announced it had executed two al-Qaida militants and said it would step up its role in the American-led military coalition against IS. Our correspondent, Paul Adams, reports from the pilot’s home village injordan. Far from jordan’s capital, in the peaceful hills above the Dead Sea, the very public rituals of condolences. This is the hometown ofjordan’s murdered pilot. A magnet now for thousands of people anxious to pay their respects. A chance to share the family’s grief, to embrace, to pray, and grapple with the sheer horror of what’s happened. Moaz al-Kasasbeh’s father will spend much of the next three days here in this tent. In that time, he’ll meet a great many well-wishers, but he’ll also hear a great number of questions. How, if at all, canjordan punish those responsible for his son’s death? What should the country’s role be in the US-led coalition against Islamic State? You said last week that you were not sure that this was jordan’s fight. Do you still feel that way today? TRANSLATION: I am now certain that jordan must fight them in their hideouts. Outside our borders, because they are coming for us. We must fight them before they reach us. But before that, a gesture of revenge. This nondescript pre-dawn convoy carrying the bodies of two Al-Qaeda prisoners. Their longstanding death penalties now carried out. Later, on the road to the airport, displays of solidarity and defiance as King Abdullah returned home from Washington. This was hardly spontaneous, but as the King swept through it was heartfelt. This small country rallying together at a time of wounded pride. jordan says it is fighting back. The King, meeting security officials, spoke of a relentless war to protect faith, values and human principles. The government says it’s increasing its participation in the US-led coalition, but how far? Nobody was talking about ground troops. We’re talking about helping the Iraqi military. about helping the Syrian moderate opposition, or Peshmerga troops, in order to fight on the ground. The soldiers who come to offer their condolences don’t expect to be thrust into the fight, but the trauma of the past 10-days has brought the battle against Islamic State that much closer. Paul Adams, BBC News, jordan. Sport now, and the golden generation of Ivorian footballers has one more chance at continental glory this year. Ivory Coast have reached a third Africa Cup of Nations Final in six tournaments. They beat the Democratic Republic of Congo 3-1 in Wednesday night’s semi-final in Equatorial Guinea. The second semi is this Thursday, between the hosts and Ghana, but in this match, the Ivorian goals were scored by Yaya Toure, Gervinho and Wilfried Kanon. Their fans will be hoping the current team can add to the only African title, which was won in 1992. Piers Edwards was in Bata. Greene CHEERING. Ivory Coast fans are joyous after reaching their third Africa Cup of Nations finals in six tournaments, making it three beating 3-1. Goals from Yaya Toure, Gervinho and Kanon giving them the goals. Ultimately, it was a consolation for the visitors with their final goal. consolation for the visitors with theirfinal goal. Having their final goal. Having reached the finals, can they win their first title since 1992? Only their second overall to make these finals even more exciting. The Liverpool captain Steve Gerrard made his 700th club appearance on Wednesday night, and his team beat Bolton 2-1 in their fourth round replay of the English FA Cup. Bolton took the lead with an Eidur Gudjohnsen penalty, and even when they had a man sent off in the 66th minute, it looked as if they were going to hang on. But Raheem Sterling equalised in the 86th minute, and Phillipe Coutinho scored Liverpool’s winner in injury time. They’ll play at Crystal Palace in the fifth round. In Spain, Real Madrid held on to beat Sevilla 2-1 and increaseed their lead at the top of the Primera Liga to four points. They are in front of Barcelona. They were without the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, but goals from james Rodriguez and substitute jese were enough to see off fourth-placed Sevilla. In Germany, Borussia Dortmund are still bottom of the Bundesliga after losing at home to Augsburg on Wednesday. The only goal of the game was scored early in the second half by Augsburg’s Argentine striker, Raul Bobadilla. They’re up to fourth in the table. Meanwhile, Dortmund remain two points adrift at the bottom. Another disappointing night for coachjurgen Klopp, and the Dortmund fans who had to be placated by some of the players. It is the 90th minute, actually the 94th minute in the Coppa Italia final. In Italy, Gonzalo Higuain scored the only goal of the game as Napoli beat Inter to reach the last four of the Coppa Italia. The goal came in the fourth minute of injury time, and Napoli will play Lazio in the semis. Handwashing started Ha ndwashing started when Republican senator challenged regulations like making employees wash their hands every time they use the bathroom. Our correspondent reports from Washington. You might be wondering why you are watching me wash my hands. The act of rubbing soap and water in our palms entered the political debate in Washington after one senator said forcing staff in places like Starbucks to wash their hands every time they go to the toilet is an example of government overreach. I have no problem with Starbucks if they opt out of this policy so long as they post a sign that says we don’t require our employees to wash their hands after wiping. He has problems with signs which he says demonstrate the overregulation of the US government. He says it should be up to businesses and the market to decide. Does he have a point? I think that’s utterly ridiculous. I have worked at a Starbucks. I think you should wash your hands. I don’t even know, that sounds absurd to me. I think there is legitimate concern about government overreach but things that concern public health like vaccines or minimal things like washing hands that are proven to prevent disease should be encouraged and mandated. Some will go to any lengths to make sure you scrub properly as these videos from across the world show. How long do you take to wash your hands? Do you heed the instructions that people say you have to wash your hands? Ten seconds. Ten seconds? Yeah. When you wash your hands you’re supposed to go on all sides. 20 seconds is the recommendation, did you know that? No, Ididn’t. How long do you take to wash your hands? Usually it is the alphabet, I have learned that. # wash your hands. # after toilet use. Washing your hands should be as easy as ABC, but as this debate shows, not everyone thinks you need to be told. If you’ve ever found an antique worth a bit of money in your garage, cellar, or loft, you’ll know how exciting a discovery like that can be. Well, imagine finding a car collection worth millions, and imagine if it had been hidden away for 50 years. It’s happenned in France, as Richard Forrest reports. Rusty, broken, covered in dust and worth millions. 60 vintage cars that have been hidden away for half a century. Now discovered in the grounds of a remote French castle thanks to a single phone call. The granddaughter of the late collector, Roger Baillon, told an auction house she had a Ferrari 250 California. When the valuer arrived, he couldn’t believe what else he found. The collection is estimated about 12-50 million euros. We hope to reach over 20 million. Really, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy restorable cars from the 40s and 50s. The collection of cars has gone on display at a Paris exhibition centre and they are up for sale on Friday. An exciting opportunity if you are good with engines and have a million or two to spare.

Coming up injust a couple of minutes, Sally has all the latest business news in World Business Report. First, a look at the weather where you are. Hi, there. Cold air is firmly with us at the moment. We’re seeing a few snow flurries to take us into Thursday morning. The cold air not sticking around for too much longer, this dolphin shape of mild air out to the Atlantic is going to take a bite out of the cold, lifting those temperatures back to near normal for the time of year over the next few days. Before we get there, though, it is going to be another pretty cold night with a touch of frost across western areas, a few mist and fog patches here and there, and the cloud will continue to thicken up, bringing showers in off the North Sea, moving into eastern parts of England. However, inland, you may see sleet and snow in those showers. We start the day on a slippery note for some places. Scotland and Northern Ireland start on a cloudy note, some cloud will be low with mist over the hills. Brightness across Wales and south-west England and wintry showers moving in across the Midlands, central, southern England and the south-east. Don’t be surprised to see snow in those showers. Over the hills, a little bit of snow settling with one or two centimetres in the snowiest places. Through Thursday it will cloud over across Wales and the south-west of England with snow showers turning back to rain through the afternoon. There could be snow showers affecting parts of Kent. Otherwise, the skies gradually brighten across eastern England. Still chilly, around five degrees. Here is Friday’s weather. Low pressure in the Mediterranean brings stormy weather. Potential flooding rain to the Balkans once again with snow in the hills. High pressure for the UK and between, we have the winds picking up, the pressure gradient tightening, driving wind in and that We’ll make it better with temperatures around five degrees. Bright spells are expected with sunshine. Further north, the wind isn’t as strong although whitest chilly with cabbages round four or five degrees. High pressure through the weekend and a flow of moist air coming around the high pressure and down the North Sea, meaning that heading into the weekend, we expect a lot of cloud, perhaps thick enough for the odd spot of drizzle around the coasts and hills in the east and south. Temperatures come back closer to average perhaps an odd degree above average. This weekend, expect a lot of cloud, mostly dry weather and certainly not feeling as cold as it has been. You’re watching BBC World News, these are our top stories: In response to the fighting in Ukraine, NATO defence ministers are expected to announce plans later today for a rapid reaction force of around 4000 troops in eastern Europe. The European Central Bank says it will no longer accept its bonds as collateral for lending money to commercial banks, which puts the new Greek government under pressure to agree a deal on its bailout with the eurozone. The journalist Peter Greste has said his two Aljazeera colleagues were happy for him to be freed from an Egyptian jail, but that it was very difficult to leave them behind and he hoped they’d be released soon. King Abdullah ofjordan has declared a relentless war against Islamic State, after a jordanian pilot was burned to death and vowed that the blood of Moaz al-Kasasbeh would not be shed in vain. Those are the latest headlines from BBC World News. Now for the latest financial news with Sally. Piling on the pressure - the ECB cuts off cheap funding to Greek banks, citing concerns about Greece’s commitment to its bailout pledges. Plus, fast, fairand open - can new US rules level the playing field for the internet business? Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Sally Bu ndock. Also in the programme: China jumps on the stimulus band wagon. Rico Hizon will have the details. We start with Greece and the battle by its new left wing government to renegotiate its bailout and cut its crippling debts whilst avoiding a disastrous exit from the euro. As you’ve been hearing, Thursday is a critical day for Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis as he heads to Berlin to meet his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble. On Wednesday Mr Varoufakis was in Frankfurt at the European Central Bank trying to drum up support. It seems he didn’t reassure the lender, or get what he wanted. Infact, quite the opposite. Late on Wednesday evening the ECB unexpectedly toughened its stance on Greece. It said it from the 11th of this month would no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral against loans to Greek banks. It cited doubts about Greece’s commitment to its bailout terms Greek banks had relied heavily on cheap loans from the ECB. This move will increase their borrowing costs and pile on the pressure on the Greek central bank, which will have to provide the funding. Greek markets are expected to be hit hard today. A fund of Greek shares plunged more than 10% in New York. And the euro sank almost 1.25%. We’ll be talking to a political risk consultant in Berlin. Carsten Nickel, Analyst at Teneo Intelligence. It would seem they are playing hardball. Good morning. Ithink that is about right. Everyone is playing hardball with Greece today, but it only goes to show how strategically successful the Germans have been over the past few years in enshrining this reformed conditionality into the crisis fighting mechanisms. The German determination to hold its line in relations to Greece seems to be very much in line with the ECB’s approach. Impression we are getting is that the ECB and Germany are saying, you stick to the rules, and thatis saying, you stick to the rules, and that is it. They are not moving on this one. It looks like Greece has got to do all the dancing to their Chew. -- tune. I think everyone involved is holding their line, they are tough negotiators. At the same time, there is still room for manoeuvre. A potential deal at the end of the day could include something like a rebranding of the troika supervisory structure. It could talk about refocusing the structures in Greece, like revenue collection. There might be items at Alexis Tsipras at the end of the day will be able to sell to his domestic electorate, but what is very clear, thatis electorate, but what is very clear, that is the message from Frankfurt, is that frontloaded conditionality, committing to a credible reform agenda on the ground in Greece has to be the first step before you can talk about assistance, whether it is from the ECB or from talk about assistance, whether it is from the ECB orfrom member from the ECB or from member states of the EU. What do you think about the view that some believe the ECB and Germany are prepared to lose the weakest Link in the eurozone? I don’t think that is very realistic. I don’t think there is any interest in Germany in getting rid of Greece. Germany has invested a lot of money and many decision-makers in Berlin have invested a lot of political capital to send a signal to markets that eurozone integration is irrevocable. It would be stupid to put this at risk now. I think the political commitment to keep the currency bloc together, that is still very strong. Nevertheless, there is a strong conviction at the same time that what you need is frontloaded conditionality and a strong commitment to reform. I think that’ll be the game we are going to see playing out of the next couple of and weeks. Markets in China are celebrating a major stimulus move by the Chinese central bank, it is freeing up some $100 billion of lending power to boost the economy. Rico Hizon is following the story in Singapore. Rico, what is going on? It would seem China is getting on the bandwagon in a big way. That’s right. You have the likes of China and Hong Kong markets rallying after the mainland central bank cut a key interest rate on Wednesday. They are following the bandwagon, we saw the Australian central bank also cutting interest rates a few days ago. The People’s Bank of China are lowering the required reserve ratio for banks by 50 basis points, about half a percent. This decision is aimed at boosting lending to try to get the economy moving, and it is widely viewed as being as effective as a cut in interest rates, and is the first industrywide move since 2012. Earlier, I spoke to a representative, asking him who would benefit the most. Usually it is state-owned firms that benefit the most, because they have the best access to funding. In this case, the central bank has tried to mitigate that by cutting the reserve ratio by more for smaller banks. They are trying to improve the allocation of credit and have a bit more bang for your buck for credit, as it were. Many economists believe this is not the last of the cuts. They forecast a couple more reductions in the cost of rolling and bank reserve requirements before june this year. -- borrowing. ""The Internet must be fast, fairand open"". That’s the call from US Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler. He’s pushing for a shake-up of rules governing internet service providers to protect so called net neutrality making sure all web traffic is treated equally. They would effectively stop ISPs giving preferential treatment to some websites over others. The rules would mean no blocking of access to any legal content, applications, or services. No throttling, or slowing down access to, any content, and no paid prioritization, or favouring of some traffic in exchange for consideration. In other words, no fast lanes. This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates. Basically for the consumer this could be very good news. It is saying that the internet is open and open for all. As such, it will be regulated as something that is almost like a necessity. It is something that people need on a regular basis. As such, internet companies aren’t going to be able to employ tactics that would perhaps favour one consumer over another. Perhaps if you are paying more you get a faster service. The Federal Communications commission hearing US, the overarching regulatory body has said, no, that is not going to happen. With me now is Matthew Howett, Regulations Analyst at Ovum. Good morning Matthew. Is there any evidence yet that this is ongoing? We are all victims of this kind of activity? What regulators are doing is trying to think about what will happen in the future. Today, the idea is that consumers generally benefit from this kind of open internet. They can access whatever they want with relatively little trouble. The problem is that in the future, where the big companies like Netflix, for instance, will strike deals with ISPs to you by your service from, will deliver that service to you without the buffering you get when you watch a film. They are trying to prevent situations where there might be exclusive deals between providers that might prevent you as a consumer from between providers that might prevent you as a consumerfrom being you as a consumer from being able to access that content, or maybe in the future from Netflix entering the market because they don’t have that relationship. The SEC is trying to plough on with this idea that the internet is fighting it, and meanwhile Europe and the rest of the world is watching with great interest to see how it balances out -- FFC. Forsomething like interest to see how it balances out -- FFC. For something like ten years the FFC has been trying to put rules in place to guarantee this. This is the first time they have thought about how they could do it more strategically. Before they have lacked the power to do anything, so by reclassifying broadband providers as a kind of utility, there are new powers to set rules. The rest of the world is watching what happens in the US, this is a global issue. In Brussels, The European Commission is thinking about how it pushes the rituals. We can’t see a situation in one country that isn’t in another, given how the internet doesn’t snowboard is the way we do. Thank you. We will probably talk to you again in the future. Sony has said it will lose less money than previously forecast, despite a hacking attack that forced it to suspend the launch. With the film the Interview, which caused problems. They had been boosted by sales of the Sony PlayStation. Ross Ulbricht, the suspected operator of underground website Silk Road, has been convicted of charges including drug trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking. Prosecutors say Ulbricht’s website brokered drug deals worth over $200 million using the bitcoin virtual currency, earning him commission of $18 million. Ulbricht, who went by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, faces up to life in prison and a mandatory minimum term of 20 years. In the markets, japan is down because of concerns about the deal possibly brokered between Greece and the ECB. That is all from me for now, thanks for watching. Spending on agency nurses in England has soared by 150% in the last two years according to the Royal College of Nursing. The nurses’ union says it means patients get less continuity in their care - and it doesn’t make sense financially. The government says an effort is being made to reduce the costs. Our health correspondent Branwen jeffreys reports. Hospitals have been hiring more permanent nurses, but many also have to buy in extra nursing staff from agencies. And so do NHS mental health and community services. Hiring a nurse to cover a shift costs more money and the nurses union says it doesn’t make sense for patients. When you get an agency nurse who has never been to award before, just finding your way around is difficult. Not knowing the patients in the same way that permanent staff would. That is not to criticise the agency nurses but it criticises a system that has an overreliance on this short-term fix, when we know there has been a long-term problem. They gathered figures on spending on agency nurses from 168 NHS Trust in England. 73% of the total. In 2012 -13, they spent £327 million on agency nurses. By last year, they spent £485 million. The RCN says the bill could soon reach almost £1 billion per year if it goes on rising at a similar rate. What you need to check on the equipment? Labour says cuts in training places are to blame, but the government points to 8000 more permanent nurses and says efforts are being made to cut the agency bill. Coming up at 6:00am on Breakfast, Charlie Stayt and Louise Minchin will have all the day’s news, business and sport. That is for you who are watching on domestic TV. This is BBC News. The top stories this hour: In response to the fighting in Ukraine, NATO defence ministers are expected to announce plans later today for a rapid reaction force of around 4000 troops in eastern Europe. Whenever they are required. The European Central Bank says it will no longer accept Greek bonds as collateral for lending money to commercial banks, which puts the new Greek government under pressure to agree a deal on its bailout with the Eurozone. The journalist, Peter Greste, has said his two Aljazeera colleagues were happy for him to be freed from an Egyptian jail, but that it was very difficult to leave them behind and he hoped they’d be released soon. It was tough, you know, we’d discussed this prospect, we knew that there was always a chance that one of us would leave and the others would have to stay. That doesn’t make it any easier. King Abdullah ofjordan has declared a relentless war against Islamic State, after a jordanian pilot was burned to death, and vowed that the blood of Muath al-Kasasbeh would not be shed in vain. For the Middle East, it is about Islamic State, for the rest of the world, the headlines reflect a variety of stories. The European Central Bank is cranking up the pressure on Greece. It has announced it will restrict Greek banks’ access to money. That’s in the Wall Street journal. The Financial Times reports a new survey suggesting the world is now awash with more debt than immediately before the global financial crisis erupted in 2007. China Daily reports on the plane crash in Taipei, and says it’s the last in a slew of air disasters affecting Asia. The International New York Times reports that the brutal murder of a jordanian pilot by the group Islamic State has united the Arab world in revulsion. Researchers believe they may have found a way to prevent people getting the common cold, by ‘jamming’ the virus’s genetic code, to stop it replicating. That’s in the Daily Telegraph. And the Telegraph business section reports that almost a quarter of British workers admit to lying to others about theirjobs, with men more likely than women to stretch the truth. joining us is Simon Derrick Currency analyst, Bank of New York Mellon. Good morning. Because it is an economic story, go ahead. Let’s pick about this move by the ECB late yesterday. The first thing to say is when it came... The finance minister of Greece meets the governor of the European Central Bank, comes out smiling, then a matter of hours later the ECB says they won’t accept Greek debt as collateral, which sounds like a strong political message to me. It makes it more difficult for Greek ranks to borrow but far from impossible. They can use other collateral. They can go to the Greek central bank and borrow from them. It is in cutting off the Greek banks but it says to the Greek banks that they are not afraid. If you want to play hardball, we are prepared to play hardball back and it comes down to negotiations over the Greek debt and whether they will stay in the EU. Interesting, isn’t it, the thought process and initially was that they want to stay in this club, they all have that end goal, therefore, we must negotiate. People now get the view that maybe Germany is thinking they don’t need you in the club, therefore they can be really tough regardless of... Whatever Greece as will happen. That is spot on. Going back three years ago there was a clear view from when the German chance alone -- from the German Chancellor that it wasn’t acceptable for Greece to leave, not just because it is part of the eurozone but because it is about solidarity, about working together and now there seems to be this report from the media that perhaps they don’t believe that contagion is a threat and that containing the rest of the Greek exit is possible -- risk. And it can be strengthened by moving the weakest Link. That makes it easier for Germany and the ECB to negotiate toughly with Greece. I was going to ask that question anyway. Yellow we are on the same page -- link. The Times, masses of money, global debt increased by 57 trillion after almost 200 trillion cents 2007, it seems the world is living on credit and we all owe more than the world makes a. It is an absolutely astonishing number-- makes. The debts gone up by a third since the financial crisis. What has come out of the financial crisis was the hope that will become less dependent. This second part is that this has come from China, which shows the stimulus in the Chinese economy which is trying to deal with the slowdown. The third and fascinating thing, this is 280% of global GDP, the total debt, which is astonishing. Is it not a surprise that debt has gone up since 2007 in terms of governments around the world? Most have been grappling with the recession and haven’t been getting money in, tax receipts have come in, they have to borrow more in these times. Isn’t it a no-brainer? It shows the depths of the financial crisis that we have had to push debt UP crisis that we have had to push debt up by a third but it is notjust the financial crisis of course, it is the aftermath, the Eurozone crisis and the ongoing fact that China has been slowing down slowly for five years. Briefly, to what extent does it matter? In itself it doesn’t if the world is comfortable, but at some point people will say that is unsustainable. The plane crash in Taipei, the pictures are absolutely astonishing. Possibly it seems the pilot is a real hero because he may have been trying to manoeuvre the plane away from buildings. My cab driver said to me that they are great source of how normal people see a story, he said, what’s happening in Asia with these planes? I said it was a coincident. We said it was possibly about how they service planes have -- coincidence. Leuty could be all different thing. We can’t lump it in with the crash in Ukraine -- it could be. Itravel around Asia every couple of years and what interests me is the distance you have to travel to move between any centre. It’s easy to forget in Europe that you only have to fly if you hundred miles. This is a matter of the fact that this is a far more wealthy society where people are travelling to do business -- a few hundred miles. It reflects the fact that this is an economy thatis the fact that this is an economy that is starting to Boom compatible it was and people are travelling a lot more, that’s what it is a measure of. -- compared to. People trying to digestive the horrific event that took place, the jordanian pilot burnt alive, quite literally. The New York Times talks about this shift in terms of how IS is viewed by some that might have been sympathisers. The key point everyone has made for the last 12 months is, ISIS was supposedly the master of social media, the masters of height and it looks as though they have made a big misstep. You only have to look at the reaction from the jordanian king when he came back from Washington. Far from meeting anger from the population, they were very much in support of what the government was doing, what the King was doing. What is astonishing about this story is that it is radical groups within the Muslim world turning around and saying, this is way too far. This is the Muslim Brotherhood making strong comments about this. We have had people from Al-Qaeda coming out about this. That’s the real measure of, this is way too far. The Daily Telegraph, if scientists can stop a common cold, mY scientists can stop a common cold, my worry would be that it won’t help us as we grow, develop natural immunity to health issues. That is a fantastic point. This has been one of the great stories. Talking about antibiotics and the knock-on effects. You are right to highlight that. I thought they have discovered the cure, a gin and tonic. That was just me. There is a positive side. It is a huge positive. They can crack the DNA genome and make discoveries like this. That’s great! Do you stretch the truth when you tell people what you do for a living? Yes, Iwork tell people what you do for a living? Yes, I work as a bank, tell people what you do for a living? Yes, Iwork as a bank, so living? Yes, I work as a bank, sol tell everyone I am a traffic warden because that’s more sensible. There are occasions when in places I think I will be quiet about what I do. I look at that and I sympathise hugely. Sometimes a journalist is up there with an estate agent. That’s right. Thank you for coming in, Simon. Have a very good day. Goodbye. Hi, there. Cold air is firmly with us at the moment. We’re seeing a few snow flurries to take us into Thursday morning. The cold air not sticking around for too much longer, this dolphin shape of mild air out to the Atlantic is going to take a bite out of the cold, lifting those temperatures back to near normal for the time of year over the next few days. Before we get there, though, it is going to be another pretty cold night with a touch of frost across western areas, a few mist and fog patches here and there, and the cloud will continue to thicken up, bringing showers in off the North Sea, moving into eastern parts of England. Around the coastline, they’re quite likely to fall as rain. But come inland, and we could see sleet or even a little bit of snow, so things could be quite slippery first thing Thursday morning. The amount of snow still pretty difficult to get exactly spot on. Some of us will see the snow really struggling to settle. Others could get perhaps a centimetre, maybe two, in one or two spots. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, though, it’s likely to be a rather cloudy and dull start to the day. That cloud rather low in places and rather misty over the hills, too. Probably the best of any early morning brightness will be across Wales and south west England. There we have those snow showers working in across parts of the Midlands, central-southern England possibly as well. Elevation will certainly help areas like the Chilterns and the Downs perhaps more likely than others to see some heavier bursts of snow fora time. As we head into Thursday afternoon, this cloudy strip of weather is going to work into Wales and south west England, with the snow showers tending to turn back to rain here. Across Kent, there is a chance of seeing a few snow showers here through the afternoon. The skies gradually brightening up across the east. Another fairly chilly day. Temperatures, at best, around five degrees Celsius or so. For Friday, we’ve got this area of low pressure in the Mediterranean, bringing a risk of some flooding rain to the Balkans - some further snowfall across northern Italy and the Alps, particularly. High pressure still across the United Kingdom, but due to the pressure gradient, we’re going to see the winds pick up, and those winds will be bitter winds coming in from the cold continent. Temperatures four or five degrees Celsius, but feeling colder than that due to those brisk winds across England and Wales. The further north you go, the winds are that bit lighter. The temperatures are the same, but it won’t feel quite as cold across more northern stretches. A lot of dry weather, then, to end the week. Here’s Saturday’s chart, you’ll see that milderair coming in off the Atlantic, moving its way down the North Sea. A lot of moisture mixed in with this, so we’re expecting a lot of fairly low cloud, perhaps even a few spots of drizzle, especially towards some of these eastern coasts and hills. Temperature-wise though, for Saturday, we’re looking at temperatures coming back up to near average for the time of year, if not an odd degree above. For the weekend, a lot of cloud around.

First, our main story: The UK’s armed forces should do more to fight Islamic State in Iraq, according to a report by a committee of MPs. The Commons Defence Select Committee says it’s not calling for combat troops to be deployed, but says Britain should be providing more air support, as well as taking on a greater diplomatic role. Our defence correspondent jonathan Beale reports. Small teams of British troops have been training Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq. This video filmed by the army shows them teaching Kurdish forces basic infantry skills. Yet the report by MPs describes the UK’s military contribution to defeat Islamic State as surprisingly modest. Britain has sent fewer than 100 troops - that’s far fewer than Spain, Italy and Australia, as well as the US. In a highly critical report, the Commons Defence Select Committee says Britain should be doing much more. My personal guess is that, in a sense, British people - or the British Government- maybe feels traumatised by its last experience in Iraq. There’s real reluctant, even though Britain has real interest there, even though ISIS poses a real threat to the stability of the region and to Britain - I think people arejust reluctant to get involved in anything that has the word ""Iraq"" in it. While RAF tornadoes and unmanned drones have been targeting Islamic State fighters in Iraq, so far they’ve only carried out 6% of the coalition air strikes. Evidence, say the committee, that ministers, officials and senior military officers have failed to set out a clear strategy to meet their goal of defeating the extremists, who now control an area the size of the UK. The report also says that it’s unacceptable that Britain has instead signed up to a strategy completely owned by the US. New figures suggest that spending on agency nurses in England has soared by 150% in the last two years. The Royal College of Nursing says it doesn’t make financial sense, and means patients get less continuity in their care. The Government says an effort is being made to reduce the costs. ",,

But what was the impact on commuters? We’ll have the latest. Plus, as the cold snap continues, Alina will be here with a full weather forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Tesco is to face another investigation - this time into the way it treats its suppliers. The newly created Groceries Code Adjudicator will look at allegations that the supermarket giant treated its suppliers unfairly. The inquiry’s been launched in response to information, submitted when the company overestimated its forecast profits by more than £26O million last autumn. Victoria Fritz reports. An accounting scandal, criminal investigation and now this. Delaying payments and bullying suppliers, this is at the heart of their woes. Its relationship with thousands of companies that make all of these products, the suppliers. They actually pay supermarkets to get brands in the best places. For instance they would rather be up here than down there. It isjust one example of dozens of fees that they PHY example of dozens of fees that they pay to do business. A deal with mighty Tesco can make or break a small business. Tesco stands accused of abusing its position of power. This small chocolate producer knows all about the pressure. Tesco hit them at the last minute with unexpected charges. It took five months and threats of legal action to be fully paid. £6,000 is nothing for Tesco but that was the wages bill for us. If they had not have paid that we would have been bankrupt in a month. This is the first time that the ombudsman has launched an investigation into a supermarket but its powers are limited if it finds fault. It cannot find Tesco for any past misdemeanours. -- administerfinds. misdemeanours. -- administer finds. According misdemeanours. -- administerfinds. According to the ombudsman it is not important. Iam not According to the ombudsman it is not important. I am not raising important. Iam not raising money from fines, when I asked suppliers what they wanted, overwhelmingly, they all said we want a more collaborative supply chain, we want to be able to work better with retailers. And they say the relationship between the retail and suppliers has been broken for some time. Management have been transparent about how they are trying to correct them, they have a new Chief Executive who is a former supplier and he is very aware of issues surrounding Tesco. And he has already made clear steps into things that this investigation will be looking at and putting them right. Tesco is twice the size than its biggest rival, it says it has already changed and will co-operate fully with the best occasion. Victoria is with me now. How big of a blow is it? Perhaps not as big as you might originally think. This is not the first investigation we are having, a criminal investigation when it comes to the Serious Fraud Office, and they are also being investigated by the financial reporting Council so this has been out in the open for some time. Those investigations are ongoing and the latest one will go from 6-9 months. The troubles for Tesco keep building, they have a turnaround plan but it could be months before they get the contract. The French President Francois Hollande says he’s heading to Ukraine with xthe German Chancellor Angela Merkel to present a new peace initiative. He said they will put forward the new plan before meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow tomorrow. More than 5000 people have been killed in the fighting since last April. Let’s speak to our correspondent jonathan Marcus who’s at NATO headquarters in Brussels. How much do we know about what’s in the plan? We don’t know much detail of the plan at all and that is perhaps not surprisingly suppose. It is clear from the French president Francois Hollande that he insists on maintaining the territorial integrity of Ukraine. This joint initiative from the French and Germans is a measure of the growing sense of urgency now surrounding the Ukraine crisis. As you say, I am here at Nato where there is a ministerial meeting of defence ministers. They will be announcing later today the establishment of a new rapidly deployable spearhead force which has been prompted by the crisis in Ukraine because many smaller allies of Nato on the eastern flank, the Baltic republics, they are also concerned and worried about what is going on in Ukraine, they are worried about the direction of Russian policy and so on. That force will be 5000 strong, Britain is going to play a leading role, it will be in command in 2017 and it will provide around 1000 of the 5000 strong troops. At the same time of course a number of countries are beginning to talk about arming the Ukrainian government’s forces. The United States’ debate is shifting and Britain for now is insisting it will only provide non-lethal aid to Kiev, but with the debate shifting, it gives the Franco German diplomatic initiative much more significance. Thank you. The UK should be doing more in the fight against Islamic state - according to a group of MPs. The Defence Select Committee says the nightmare of a jihadist state establishing itself across Iraq and Syria has been realised. The MPs say the UK should increase air support and train more Iraqi forces, but they stop short of calling for British boots on the ground. Our correspondent Nick Childs reports. Iraqi Kurdish volunteers on the front line, ready, they say, to confront the fighters of so-called Islamic State. To defend their homes with what they have. If we did not do it, the whole place will be full of Isis. They would destroy everything. Here they say they have not seen a single Western air strike to help them. Now an influential committee of MPs in a highly critical report is arguing Britain can and should do more in the air and on the ground to contribute to the US-led strategy in confronting Isis. That does not mean, troops and people fighting, it means people whose job it is to really understand the politics of Iraq and what the militia are doing and the fighting force on the site of the Baghdad government and what is happening in Sunni areas and try to road test this plan and feed into the discussions. Britain has sent small teams to train Iraqi Kurdish forces in basic weapons skills, but the MPs say that these efforts like behind other Western countries. According to the report British planes have carried outjust 6% to the report British planes have carried out just 6% of coalition air strikes, about one every day. That is second only to the Americans and MPs are wrong to argue that Britain has not set out a clear strategy. Some people argue that defence cuts have affected the British role. There is no question that with 20% less conventional forces which are also at less higher readiness than they once were, the UK’s ability to respond to security threats is reduced. In the devastated Syrian town of Kobani, hundreds of coalition air strikes did help to lift the Isis siege, but this new report is again asking whether Britain and its partners have the right plan and are devoting enough resources to defeat Islamic State on the ground. With me is our security correspondent Frank Gardner. This group of MPs says the UK should do more but will it change anything? I don’t think it will, they say that Britain is talking tough but carrying a small stick and it needs to do more. A government spokesman hasissued to do more. A government spokesman has issued a rebuttal saying that the policy is clear, we are training forces over there and we have sent trainers, we will be delivering 1000 counter improvised explosive device pieces of equipment, etc. David Cameron does not want to be drawn into this any further. I don’t know but I am sensing that when there was a boat in the Commons 18 months ago about whether to go to war in Syria, the government found there was no appetite. In the meantime you have been looking at documents that Isis have published online telling us more about life under Isis. It is a kind of women’s manifesto, not an official document but published by female supporters. It has been translated by the counter extremist think tank in London and it is essentially aimed at Saudi women and Gulf Arab women saying, you live in hell over there because of all of this depravity, you have do share shops with men, show your face on your ID and live in a place where there are female writers... They are fallen women. Instead come to the utopia of Islamic State, nothing is banned and you can mix with Chechens, etc. It is a come and join us thing. They say it is legitimate for girls to marry as young as nine and that they should be educated only from the ages of seven to 15 and only in religious scripture. It is a reflection of a hardline version of Islam. Thank you. The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, has said his party will seek to pay off the deficit in two years if they win the election. In a speech setting out his party’s economic policy, he said they would increase taxes on the better-off and big businesses and make Eli billion worth of welfare cuts to help protect public services such as schools and hospitals and to balance the books. Our political correspondent, Iain Watson reports. Whoever wins the election, there will be more cuts. Perhaps it was appropriate that the Lib Dems launch their plans to bring down the deficit at the shard, a building with very sharp edges. The views from the building suggest that people down there should be paying more. Undera people down there should be paying more. Under a Conservative majority government there will be no light at the end of the tunnel, instead there will be austerities with no end in sight. And Labour’s approaches no less dismal. What are the Lib Dems proposing? They say there will be £8 billion of tax increases including an expensive homes but no rise in income tax or VAT. There will be a further Eli billion of welfare cuts, benefits would rise by less than inflation and the better off would lose their free TV licence and winter fuel payments. They are putting forward more detailed plans but they are only polling at 8% so they can only put this into practice in coalition. I asked him they can only put this into practice in coalition. Iasked him if in coalition. I asked him if Labour did not agree to cut more quickly or the Conservatives said no to higher taxes, would he refused tojoin another government? Forget coalitions, another government? Forget coalitions, they won’t be able to deliver it if they are in government on their own. The Conservatives are literally coming up with total made UP literally coming up with total made up figures. Tax cuts here or there with no idea how to pay for it. That was not a definite no, but he also criticised Labour’s lack of responsibility. The policy ideas are pretty similar, they both want to raise taxes on high wealth groups, they have similar ideas on the mansion tax. There are enough areas of overlap where if they wanted to make a deal work they could. The Chancellor insists he is not planning for another coalition with Lib Dem colleagues. There is a real choice in this election and it is between David Cameron and Ed Miliband in Downing Street, between our long-term plan and the chaos offered by the Labour Party. The Lib Dems have high aspirations to be backin Dems have high aspirations to be back in government. But they may not be in position to deliver on their plans. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor Norman Smith. Two years to pay off the deficit, what do you make of the plans? Nick Clegg is like the Demon dentist saying, drilling away, just a little bit more and we will be done. That is what he is saying, two more years of austerities and then we will be back to better times but to get there there is an awful lot more drilling to do, £13 billion worth of extra drilling. Including £8 billion of additional taxes. extra drilling. Including £8 billion of additionaltaxes. Now, Mr Clegg seized it-- says of additionaltaxes. Now, Mr Clegg seized it -- says that seized it-- says that this will be paid for by big business but he has ruled out a lot of areas saying there will be no rise in income tax or VAT and no rise in national insurance or corporation tax. There will be no increase in inheritance tax. And you are scratching your head wondering how he will make his sums add up. Thank you. The UK phone giant BT has agreed to buy the British mobile operator EE for £12.5 billion. The takeover creates a communications giant covering fixed-line phones, broadband, mobile and TV. The deal must now be approved by BT shareholders and is expected to be completed by March next year. Well with me is our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-jones. One of BT’s rivals described it as the new old BT. In the old days British Telecom had a separate mobile phone division called Cellnet, which it sold off. It has a mobile phone division again, bigger TV, offering all sorts of services. It will have 21+.5 million mobile subscribers through EE, and about 10 million broadband subscribers it has already got, so a powerful player. What is it going to mean for the millions of customers? BT says it means more competition, a better offerfor its means more competition, a better offer for its customers because they will compete with the likes of sky and Virgin and they claim it could mean better prices, lower prices. The rivals are saying this means less competition in the market, BT is too powerful. They’ll be pressing hard for the regulators to step in and perhaps split off BT’s open reach division, which supplies fibre network services. They think BT will have too much power in the market. Our top story this lunchtime. Tesco is to face another investigation - this time into the way it treats its suppliers. And still to come: Dinner for one - why diners in Seoul are seeking company on the internet. Coming up in the sport, Clarke Carlisle has admitted he was attempting suicide when he was hit by a lorry in December. He was released from hospital last week after six weeks of treatment. Greece’s new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has urged Germany not to humiliate the Greeks over their debts. He was speaking in Berlin, where he’s been meeting his German counterpart as he tries to win support for Greece’s plan to restructure its debt. The German finance minister said he recognised how tough the past few years have been for Greece and the progress they’ve made. But he said Greece must honour its commitments. Our correspondent jenny Hill is in Berlin. The German tabloid press still referred to the new Greek government as the euro monster and that so-called monster is seeking solutions to its debt crisis. This morning the new Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis faced what was expected to be his toughest meeting yet. The German press call him the bad boy of the new Greek government. Yanis Varoufakis travelled in economy and arrived with a new message. Let me warn everyone that I’m coming with a determination to tell the truth, to reboot our relationship in order to gain the trust of the German people, of the German chancellor, of the German finance minister. In this Berlin restaurant they serve Greek food to hungry Germans. What, they wonder, might Germany be prepared to serve up to Greece? Theodora, who is Greek, tells me what her country needs is a new start. The Greeks don’t want to beg for help, she says, they want help that comes freely and in friendship. They don’t want to be blackmailed, they want help so they can grow. She’d get on well with Dennis. but Germany’s response, Greece has come a long way, but we must agree to disagree. I could not hide my scepticism at some of the announcement is the Greek government has made, he said. We respect the Greek voters’ choice but we expect them to respect the electorate in other countries as well. But the mood in Germany is pretty unrelenting. Senior politicians and economists are clear. We’ve bent over backwards for Greece already, they argue, there’ll be no debt relief. The Greeks have made their choice, they went to the polls and they voted for a new government. This is their right. We call this democracy. But what is not right is that now the new government runs around in Europe and says OK, we need some people to pay for the promises we gave the people. What if Greece says you know what, this is unacceptable, we’re going to leave the Eurozone. This would be the best thing for both sides. Much at stake than as Yanis Varoufakis arrived for his meeting Today, the German finance minister, next week the German Chancellor meets the new Greek Prime Minister. Before that happens Germany is already offering practical help to Greece. This morning the finance minister said that Germany will send 500 tax experts to the country, to help it reform its tax system. Much still to be discussed. The bottom line in Germany according to the finance minister is that Greece and Germany enjoyed a long tradition of working together and he believes that can continue into the future. There were a record number of anti-Semitic hate crimes committed in the UK according to a charity. The number of verbal and physical attacks more than doubled to 1168. In one attack the victim was racially abused and hit with a baseball bat. The Home Secretary says the figures are deeply concerning. Rescue teams in Taiwan are continuing to search for people who remain unaccounted for after a plane crashed in a river. More pictures have emerged of the escape of the taxi driver, the taxi was struck by the wing of the plane. The relatives came to the crash site today holding inscriptions to guide the spirits of the dead to rest. A day earlier the final moments of the TransAsia airliner, with 58 people on board, had been caught on the dashboard camera of this passing car. 15 people were rescued. Among them, a 72-year-old man, seen here moments afterwards. From his hospital bed he’s been speaking of how he helped other passengers who were trapped in their seats. ""I had to move quickly,"" he said, ""or I knew they’d be dead."" Today, we filmed this evidence of another lucky escape. The taxi struck by the plane’s wing tip. The moment is clearly visible on the dashboard camera. And as it keeps rolling as this footage from a Taiwan station shows, the driver, a 52-year-old man, can be seen getting out, suffering only minor injuries. ""A plane has hit my car,"" he can be heard saying in this call back to base. ""A model plane, right?"" the operator replies. ""No, one with a pilot in it,"" he insists. As the plane glanced off the elevated flyover above, many people in Taiwan are wondering whether the pilot was deliberately trying to bring it down into the water to increase the chances of survival of those on board and to avoid hitting surrounding buildings. The air accident investigation may tell us more, of course, but it is certainly the case that this dreadful disaster could have been so much worse. For now the priority is to find the bodies of those still missing. The cold and muddy conditions are making that task so much harder. A state of emergency has been declared in the Galapagos Islands, were fuel has leaked from a stricken cargo ship.The vessel- carrying 10,000 gallons of fuel - ran aground on the Unesco World Heritage Site last week. The spill is threatening wildlife and some of the region’s unique plants. The number of deaths and injuries on Britain’s roads is continuing to rise. 1,730 people were killed in accidents between September 2013 and 2011+ - according to the latest government figures. It’s a 1% rise on the year before. In total the number of people killed or seriously injured reached almost 21+,500 during the same period - a 1+% rise. The number of children under 16 killed or injured has also risen by 3%. NHS spending on agency nurses has soared in the past two years, according to the Royal College of Nursing who describe the trend as ""bad for patients"". The Department of Health says it’s necessary because of what it calls ""historic understaffing"". Our health correspondent Branwenjeffreys has more. Hospitals have been hiring more permanent nurses but many parts of the NHS have to buy in extra staff from agencies. It costs more money and the nurses’ union says it is not good for care. Agency nurses may have never been to a ward before, even finding your way around is difficult, not knowing the patients in the same way that permanent staff would. That’s not to criticise the agency nurses, but it criticises the system that has an overreliance on the short-term fix, when we know there’s been a long-term problem. They gathered figures on spending on agency nurses from 168 NHS Trusts, 73% of the total. In 2012-13, they spent £327 million on agency nurses. By last year, they spent £1+85 million. The RCN says the bill could soon reach almost £1 billion a year, if it goes on rising at a similar rate. What do you need to check on the equipment now? Labour says cuts in training places for nurses are to blame and they blame poor planning for what the NHS in England needs, leaving hospitals picking up a bill that could have been avoided. It’s bad every which way you look at it. It’s a false economy on a grand scale to cut training places, only to spend up to £1 billion on a growing agency bill. There are plans to increase the numbers of nurses training. In the meantime NHS managers say having enough staff is the priority. Every single NHS trust is trying to cut its agency staff bill but they are under a requirement to employ a particular number of staff and if the only way that they can find those staff is to use agency staff, they really have no choice. Qualified nurses are essential for the NHS across the UK. But shortages everywhere have led to bigger agency bills. What dozens of British tourists have had to be rescued after becoming stranded in heavy snow in Spain. Drivers were stuck for many hours after arriving at the port of Santander. The snow has caused widespread disruption across northern and central Spain. One of America’s best-known news pesenters has had to apologise on air after admitting that a story he often repeated about coming under fire in a helicopter in Iraq 12 years ago wasn’t true. Brian Williams - who anchors NBC Nightly News - had actually been in a helicopter that arrived at the scene an hour later. He was caught out after crew members finally told journalists the truth, as Richard Lister reports. From NBC News world headquarters in New York, this is NBC Nightly News with Brian Woods. Heat presents America’s highest rated news show and is paid a multi-million dollar salary. On screen, Brian Williams exudes credibility but now he’s been forced into a humiliating confession about something he did, or didn’t do, in Iraq. While covering the war, he claimed to have been in a helicopter that was hit by Iraqi fire and forced to land. A claim he often repeated. We were the northern Americans in Iraq. We were going to drop some bridge portions across the Euphrates so the third infantry could cross on them. Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in. RPG and AK-1+7. But after repeating that story last year there was a backlash. Lance Reynolds, whose helicopter was hit in the incident, tweeted sorry, dude, I don’t remember you tweeted sorry, dude, I don’t rememberyou being on tweeted sorry, dude, I don’t remember you being on my aircraft. I remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask what had happened. Then another tweet, hour after we had landed to ask what had happened. Then anothertweet, I was the pilot in command of the helicopter flying Brian Williams into Iraq during the invasion. He was on my aircraft and we were not shot down. Last night, in front of 10 million viewers, there was this. I want to apologise. I said I was travelling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire. I was instead on the following aircraft. This was a bungled attempt by me to thank one special veteran and by Extension our brave military men and women. His career has taken a hit. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today: Tesco is to face another investigation - this time into the way it treats its suppliers. In a moment, Sarah Keith Lucas will be here with the the weather- plus the news where you are. But first, with news of the Six Nations and all the rest of the day’s sport, here’s Hugh Woozencroft. There are just 18 months before the start of the Rio with the Olympics and there are questions over whether the games will be ready on time. Organisers insist they are making good progress but major concerns about water pollution, environmental damage and potential protests remain. Nick Pope has been given an exclusive look at the country’s preparations. Rio has a pollution problem due to the illegal dumping of waste. When the test event took place last year there were sofas and even dead animals floating on the surface and conditions have not improved. Even the organisers say thatit improved. Even the organisers say that it will not be as clean as they hoped. That is a serious worry. We could eventually have garbage on this side of the bay. It is a big issue. When we took this mission, only 12% of sewage was treated. Before being thrown into the bay. Now 52% is being treated. It is still a concern because the water is not fully clean. Another major problem is the golf course with progress stalled by legal challenges. Some people claim that it is being built on a nature reserve and it is causing environmental damage. They are nearing completion. It is a blow for lobbyists like jews who sees it as another waste of public funds and she is predicting protests like those seen ahead of the World Cup. -- Gisele. We see how much is being invested in sport but not in health and education. People will certainly be protesting. The people who live in Rio are little upset but it is a good cause. Rio will be a better City in 2017 compared to 2015. Organisers say the Olympics will be delivered on time and on budget but it could still be a bumpy road. Scotland have made two changes to their side for their opening Six Nations match against France on Saturday. Mark Bennett returns to Vern Cotter’s line-up after injury and joins his Glasgow Warriors team-mate Alex Dunbar in the centres. Euan Murray returns at tighthead prop. Scotland last won in Paris in 1999 but go into the Six Nations on the back of five wins in their last seven Tests. Ireland have also named their team - they play Italy in Rome on Saturday. Sean O’Brien is in the back-row, for his first international in well overa year but his Leinster colleague jamie Heaslip misses out with injury. Details of all the Six Nations teams for the weekend can be found on the BBC Sport website. The former footballer and Professional Footballers Association chairman Clarke Carlisle has revealed he was attempting suicide when he was hit by a lorry in December. In an interview with the Sun newspaper today, Carlisle says he felt he ""had to die"" after he was charged with a drink driving offence. The charge, along with other factors, led him into deep depression. Carlisle spent six weeks in hospital which he says made him realise he was ""incredibly unwell"". Defending champion Lee Westwood and Graeme McDowell share the first round lead at the Malaysia Open. Westwood enjoyed a good day at the Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club, mixing seven birdies with one bogey to record a round of 66. His Ryder Cup team-mate McDowell matched his effort with a birdie on his last hole. Both players are on six-under-par, a shot ahead of the rest of the field. And one other quick line for you - the Kilmarnock manager Allan johnston says he’ll leave his job at the end of the season. That’s all sport for now. Back to you Sophie... In South Korea more than a quarter of the population live alone. And increasingly people looking for companionship are turning to the internet where they pay to watch others eating dinner. It’s called ‘remote companionship’ as our Seoul correspondent Steve Evans reports. Eating for money. It is an online phenomenon. Ordinary people eat at home in front of the webcam and thousands watch remotely from their own computers. This man is a star of this Internet entertainment. Tonight on the menu is spicy squid plus conversation. Broadcast from his own living room in his seventh war apartment. -- living room in his seventh war apartment. -- seventh floor. Most of mY apartment. -- seventh floor. Most of my audience are teenagers, and women in their 30s, they like to watch me because I sometimes act as a counsellor, listening to their grievances. This is a very old-fashioned way of eating. In a restaurant with people all around. South Korea is very technological and people often live separate lives, a quarter of South Koreans live on their own. They need companionship via a webcam and that is becoming a big thing. Why would anyone pay to watch someone else eat? This girl is a video blogger but she also tunes in to watch others eat and she has a theory. A lot of people diet in Korea and in the middle of the night when you can’t get yourself chicken or whatever, they watch people eating and it satisfies their hunger. It sounds weird but yes, that is how it started. They say stuff like you should definitely try this out and they sit down to eat watching the video. These people can earn hundreds of dollars an hour, they’re on our students who turned the camera on themselves while they study and people watch them and pay. Remote companionship can take strange forms. Time for a look at the weather... Here’s Sarah Keith Lucas. A little bit of snow on the way? That’s right, possibly over the next 21+ hours. Maybe coming out of this cloud across central parts. A bit of hill snow in there. This cloud zone moves westward through this evening and brighter conditions will filter in. Temperatures in Norwich will only be 1+ degrees. Contrast that with eight Celsius in Belfast. Many places will be dry with brightness out there as we end the day and then overnight this sleet will move eastwards and ease away and we will see clear and colder conditions taking charge across England and Wales. Temperatures even falling below freezing. With a mild start to the day further north and with more in the way of cloud. This is eight o’clock on Friday morning. Sharp frost across parts of Wales and dry conditions from the word go. An isolated chance of sleet and showers in the south-east with ice on the roads. Further north, though, the default patch across Northern Ireland, northern England and southern Scotland too. Cloudier skies in Scotland in the north where there could be drizzle and it will be milder than recently. Lots of dry weather through the day with isolated showers at first. Then we are looking at the best of the brightness in the south-east but feeling cold because we have the breeze coming in from the east and north-east. Although it is above freezing it will feel subzero for many areas with the wind chill. Further north the lighter so it will feel milder but four or 5 degrees across the country. Cloudier skies in the north brightest further south. High pressure is well and truly in charge as we had through the week and into the weekend. It will ease off by Saturday. Not quite as strong a breeze in the south-east as we have been seeing. Temperatures will be roundabout 6-8 . And then spot the difference on Sunday. Cloudy skies across the UK. A chance of drizzle at times. To summarise the weekend whether it was they fairly cloudy and mostly dry. It will be less cold than it has been in recent days. Over the next 21+ hours it will still have the potential for sleet and snow and there are weather warnings. You can find the latest about that on the website. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime... Tesco is to face another investigation - this time into the way it treats its suppliers. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Katharine Carpenter. Commuters faced another morning of disruption today as bus drivers went on strike over pay. It’s the second time they’ve walked out this year. Transport for London says nearly half the usual buses were running but the union Unite disputes that figure. Here’s our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards. A second bus strike and more disrupted journeys, this was Highbury, not many buses and resignation. It is annoying and it affects a lot of people. I have just realised I will have two walk to work now. How late will you be ? Probably about 20 minutes. There are over 6 million bus journeys a day in London. This was Stoke Newington. It is annoying until you realise that it does not make that much difference when you are out of the house, I guess. This was King’s Cross. It is not fair because now I am going to be late to college. I use this bus anyway so I have not noticed any difference today. At this stage of rush-hour it does, compared to the last strike, feel like more buses are running. Transport for London says that 1+7% of services are on the road, compared tojust a third during the last strike. Those figures are wildly optimistic say the unions. This was how Oxford Street looked. The roots of this dispute are in the privatisation of the bus service in London 20 years ago. It means that 18 companies have different rates. Pay for drivers varies between £17,000 and £28,000 a year. The union wants a single pay structure. Unite is not looking for one rate of pay regardless of how many hours and what hours drivers do, we are looking for one pay structure for drivers who work in a regulated industry collecting the same fares, requiring the same training and qualifications and we’re going to sit down with of the employers, just like we do in other industries in this country, just like the bus industry does in European countries, ",,

The former glam rock singer, now seventy, carried out the offences at the height of his fame. The police said he took advantage of his stardom in the seventies to become a habitual sexual predator.

And scientists discover when the very first stars began to shine Tonight on BBC London: Another day of disruption as bus drivers walk out for a second time in their ongoing pay dispute. And the former teacherjailed for sexually abusing boys at a prestigious Catholic school. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at six. Gary Glitter has been found guilty of a string of sex abuse offences against young girls in the 1970s and 80s. The crimes took place when the former glam rock singer was at height of his fame. It’s his third conviction for sexual offences involving children. In 1999 he was sentenced to four and a half months in prison after images of child porn were found on his computer. In 2006, he was sentenced to four years injail in Vietnam after molesting young girls there. Sarah Campbell is outside Southwark Crown Court where this latest trial has been taking place. Sarah... This was a case involving three women now in their 1+os and 50s, they had the same shared experience, sexual assault when they were young girls at the hand of a celebrity. They hope that the guilty verdict was also hope to his victims. Catalogue is difficult to watch and listen to, knowing what he was doing in private to girls as young as eight. He has heard those girls, now middle-aged women, describing their ordeals. He shook his head, mouthing no, disbelieving what he was hearing. He was equally in denial in the Nam in 2006 when he wasjailed for molesting young girls. -- Vietnam. It is a conspiracy. He had been renting this bill. For the first time one of the girls has spoken out. -- first time one of the girls has spoken out. -- Villa. He dragged me into the bedroom. I did not know anything at the time. He looks like a fatherfigure. I did not expect him to do these terrible things. Please do something so he does not commit these crimes again. 30 years before he was abusing girls in Vietnam he was doing it right here in the UK. He had a string of hits and had fans of all ages. One of his victims said in court- he was famous, who would believe her? A second woman took the jury back to Leicester in the 1970s. There was a venue called Baileys. She and her mother watched Gary Glitter perform here, met him backstage, and he invited them to his hotel suite. She, like the other women involved in this case, sobbed throughout much of her evidence, describing how she found herself alone here with Glitter drinking champagne and having sexual intercourse with a man whose posters were all over her bedroom walls. He was in his 30s, she was 12. It wasn’t until the 1990s that the dark side of Gary Glitter started to emerge. He’d taken his computer for repair to this Bristol store. On the hard drive were thousands of obscene pictures, including adults abusing young children. After serving two months in prison, he appeared emotional and contrite. I’ve served my time. I want to put it all behind me. The one and only Gary Glitter in person. Two men, connected by their celebrity and, as we now know, a desire to abuse children. It wasn’t long after the true nature ofjimmy Savile became clear that Glitter, in 2012, was arrested by officers from the Met’s team looking into historical sexual abuse. I’d like to commend the bravery of the victims for coming forward. The courage and strength required in order to report allegations of this nature cannot be underestimated. Glitter is now in custody for crimes too shocking to fully detail. His victims have finally received justice, and he faces a maximum life term behind bars. Detectives called him a sexual predator who took advantage of his star status. He is on a list of disgraced celebrities including Rolf Harris and Max Clifford. His sentencing was adjourned until later this month and he is now in custody. At the age of 70 he must know that he could spend the rest of his life injail. A new diplomatic push is underway to try to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine. The US secretary of State john Kerry will be joined in the Ukrainian capital Kiev by the French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to present a new peace initiative. Fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels has killed more than 5,000 people since last April. Here’s our diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall. It’s like a ghost town. The centre of the bouts of in eastern Ukraine. Still in government hands, but onlyjust. It is surrounded by rebels on three sides. The war is just around the corner, and everyone who can is getting out. TRANSLATION: The past two weeks have been especially awful. Terrifying. Bombing day and night. She and her 80-year-old father also trying leave. The buses are crammed full of desperate evacuees. The fighting is also extending into the heart of rebel held territory. Under shellfire too residential areas of Donetsk, but which side to blame is often hard to tell. For those living here it is a matter of grim survival, long queues for water and basic foods. Often no heat or power either. What suddenly raised the alarm over Ukraine’s crisis is the worrying way that the conflict has recently escalated after rebel leaders declared an offensive, apparently to extend beyond the areas that they already hold. This week the rebels have virtually encircled government troops in the key railway hub and they also seized Donetsk airport which is now in ruins. There was also shelling in the port of Mariupol, and the fighting seems to be spreading more widely. Amidst the renewed Angstrom that something must be done, the US Secretary of State was today in Kiev. Convinced that Russia is arming the rebels. It is possible that this could come to an end but only starting with a cease-fire, moving heavy equipment back and beginning to deal with the issues that we know are on the table. The Kremlin still denies fuelling the conflict and from Moscow today came a sharp warning that Russia would you US arms to Kiev to a threat to its security. -- arms to Kiev to a threat to its security. -- would view that. Unexpectedly France and Germany are on a peace mission, rushing to Ukraine today and are going to Moscow tomorrow, but eight trek through in the complex conflict seems a long way off. -- through in the complex conflict seems a long way off. -- but a breakthrough. Tesco is facing another official investigation - this time over the whether the UK’s biggest retailer has treated its suppliers unfairly. The industry watchdog says it’s investigating allegations of delayed payments, failure to pay at all and unjustified penalties. A former Scottish government minister described the alleged practices by Tesco as like something out of the film the Godfather. Emma Simpson has more. Tesco’s troubles keep on coming, the UK’s new grocery watchdog has now launched an investigation into how Britain’s biggest retailer has been treating its suppliers. I have got reasonable suspicion they have breached the supply code of practice into areas, one for delays in payments and the other for taking payments for certain positions on a sheH payments for certain positions on a shelf when it is not in a promotion. Stack it and sell it, what could be more simple? But Tesco like other retailers also earns millions of pounds from the companies who want to get their products on these shelves. And in the best places like UP shelves. And in the best places like up here, not down there. Last year 's accounting scandal shone a light on Tesco’s relationship with suppliers and bad has what triggered today’s investigation. -- suppliers and bad has what triggered today’s investigation. -- and that is what has triggered it. On panorama, the revelation that L’Oreal had disputed a £1 million payment to Tesco in 2015 and promised legal action. Tesco said it has been resolved. The ombudsman may want to turn up to this -- has been resolved. The ombudsman may want to turn up to this -- may want. A delay which almost put them out of business. It is forcing the supermarkets to actually look at the way they do business themselves and making sure that suppliers are treated fairly in future. Tesco have apologised saying an administrative error was made. The company is cooperating fully and says it is changing the way it works with suppliers. If wrongdoing is proven, then the new ombudsman cannot fine Tesco because she is still waiting for that power from Parliament, so is it too little too late? The ombudsman had to investigate but I believe it is also a sign that the ombudsman is getting its came into play, and they will start getting tougher on retailers and suppliers to get their relationships in order. It is Tesco in the firing line for now but this investigation could widen to the supermarkets if there is evidence from suppliers. -- widen to the supermarkets if there is evidence from suppliers. -- to other supermarkets. Germany says it will not accept a reduction in Greek debt. It follows a meeting in Berlin. He said that too much time had been wasted by Greece’s. -- Greece’s forced austerities programme. The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, has outlined plans for eight billion pounds worth of tax increases after the general election to clear Britain’s deficit by 2018. He told the BBC that that would include raising capital gains taxes for investors and businesses. He was speaking to our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale. Fixing the deficit is a long, hard road but the parties cannot agree when and where the journey should end. Voters in this election have been offered a big choice of which road to take. Like the Tories Nick Clegg wants to find £30 billion to balance the books by 2017 but... Only the Liberal Democrats can guarantee stability and fairness. Only the Liberal Democrats offer light at the end of the tunnel. We will cut less than the Conservatives and borrow less than Labour. How would he do that? There would be a mansion tax and fewer tax breaks for large firms, but no increase in income tax or corporation tax. How can you guarantee that middle-income earners will not be hit by the taxes? We are clear, we do not need to increase VAT, National Insurance or income tax or indeed corporation tax. But he told me the Lib Dems would raise capital gains, potentially to about 35%. We think we can go further than that. Capital gains tax and income tax will be looked at more closely to generate hundreds of millions of pounds. It is there. Labour said they would fix the deficit but have not said how. George Osborne said he would balance the books by cuts alone and would not even respond to the Lib Dem plans. There is a choice at this election and it is between David Cameron add Ed Miliband in Downing Street. Richmond is a wealthy corner of South West London, and a marginal seats that the Lib Dems need to win. I think the rich should pay more. I am cautious about raising taxes because we need to understand the impact. The Liberal Democrats are finished so I don’t care what they say. The Lib Dems are not just saying they will fix the deficit more fairly, they are saying there is light at the end of the tunnel and austerity does not have to go on forever. With the party on 7% in the polls the question is whether anyone is listening. The Lib Dems want voters to see the water between them and their opponents but at least here they have some way to go. Our top story this evening... Gary Glitter is found guilty of sexual offences against young girls, one under ten years of age. And still to come... Later on BBC London: Looking up - we ask whether high rise living is the best way to accommodate London’s growing population. And cracking down on car theft. The police operation targeting one of the key routes for criminals in the capital. in his team. And the prairie dog, which could be a threat to Scotland’s farmers. As many as 800,00018- to 21-year-olds will not be able to vote in the general election because they are not registered on the electoral role. A poll for the Electoral Reform Society found that 24% of 18- to 21-year-olds haven’t registered to vote. Another 9% had no idea whether they were on the register at all. Our political editor, Nick Robinson, has spent the day with young voters, speaking to those who have already decided not to vote in May’s election, and those voting for the first time. Can I get you to vote? That is what today, National voter registration day, is all about. I have brought my ballot box to the hair salon to ask a group of apprentices whether they are going to bother. Do you agree there is no point in voting? If so, vote yes. Or do you think there really is coming which case you vote no. I am 27 and I had never voted in my life. They say vote for this person or that person, at the end of the day, I don’t think all of the votes are taken into consideration. There is no point voting? Have you ever voted ? Yes, I have. It never comes true! Call it apathy or disaffection, call it what you like. Today is about trying to answer it. Let’s go! Up and down the country campaigners are trying to make sure that people get the chance to vote. That means getting your name on the register. You used to be able to rely on your college or student union or mum or dad to do it. Not now. It is an easy process, search online, register to vote. But you cannot rely on someone else to do it for you? It is up to you. Parliament is backing a campaign that now has added urgency. Because the new system of individual registration is making an old problem worse. At the last election almost half of those under 25 did not register to vote. But almost all pensioners did. That really matters. There is a huge gap between the number of young people registered to vote and the number of old people, so when it comes to making cuts, who do you think it is easier for politicians to target? That is one reason why many are ignoring those like Russell Brand who say, there is no point in voting. Why are you clear there is a point in voting? Because it depends who’s in power and it will dictate who is affecting everyone. Thinking about it deeply, there is a point because it is our future at the end of the day. I understand why people feel there is no point. Somebody at home might be thinking, she is talking nonsense, tell them... I feel if you want to change something you have to be part of something, you have to get involved and educate yourself and you have to make a change from the inside. It is all well and good saying your opinions, but if you’re not there to be listened to, why should anyone listen? It is your choice of course whether to vote and who to vote for, but if you don’t register, the choice has gone. And Keesha there in Nick’s report has applied to be part of Generation 2015, where BBC News will be following a group of 18- to 24-year-olds throughout the election campaign. Public Health England has admitted this winter’s flu jab is largely ineffective, working in only 3% of cases. That compares to a past success rate of typically 50%. Health experts say that is due to a mismatch between the strain of flu used in advance to make the vaccine and the main strain that is currently spreading around the UK. Our health editor Hugh Pym is here. Surely the problem is that doctors have to make an educated guess in advance as to which strain of flu will be the dominant one wanted yes, it is always a guess, based on predictions by the World Health Organisation. Each health system develops a vaccine based on that advice. The problem is that one strain has mutated since the vaccine started being produced, leaving it largely ineffective against that, and it is one which particularly affects the elderly, so there have been more cases of flu in care homes, more elderly being admitted to hospital with flu, and as it happens, the number of deaths in England and Wales in the first three weeks ofjanuary from all causes is UP weeks ofjanuary from all causes is up quite a lot for this year, and statisticians say the flu may have something to do with that. The advice to the elderly is, don’t worry if you get flu, there is medication from your doctor. And also, go ahead and get the jab if you have not done so, because there are other strains. The driver of a bin lorry which careered out of control and killed six people in the centre of Glasgow has said he thinks of the victims ""every minute of every day"". 58-year-old Harry Clarke told the Daily Record newspaper that he fell unconscious in the vehicle, and cannot remember anything about the accident. Police investigating the crash have submitted their initial report to prosecutors. Figures obtained by the union the Royal College of Nursing suggest that spending on agency nurses by NHS trusts in England has risen sharply. Three quarters of trusts show they are on course to spend around three times as much on agency nurses in this financial year than two years ago. The RCN said an over-reliance on agency staff affected continuity of care and was bad for patients. The number of young people being referred to support services for help because they feel they have been born the wrong gender has more than trebled in the last three years, according to research by the BBC. A major centre helping under-18s with transgender issues says 441 young people came to them for assessment from across the UK in the last year. BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat found that compared to a total of 91 in 2010. It is thought better awareness of gender issues may be behind the rise. Reeta Chakrabarti has been speaking to 14-year-old Leo, a transgender teenager, and his mother. Here’s their story. It just felt wrong, that the body was wrong. Like, I can’t explain. To me, itjust didn’t feel like being a girl. He’d already said he’s short hair. I mean, it was when he was nine that he came to me, really distraught, and said, ""look, you’re not taking me seriously, I am a boy."" All right. Hello. Are you all right? Yeah. Leo was born Lily, but even when he was tiny his mother, Hayley, sensed that he was different. He cut off his ringlet hair at five. Last of the hair. All gone. Changed his name to Leo at 11 and now takes medication to SUppIââSS pUi3âIâty. He hated his previous life as a girl. Having to use girls’ toilets and having to wear girls’ clothes. Playing girls’ sports, all stuff like that. Each time you were categorized as a girl, that hurt you? Yeah, it was horrible. It was the worst feeling in the world. Leo might have been bullied, but he’s surrounded by a strong group of friends. They’ve always been supportive and they’ve always understood and everything. They’ve always, like, got my back and everything. Have you had anyone being unkind to you? Yeah, but, like, I don’t really care any more. It’s their problem, it’s not mine. Hayley, Leo is a boy, and he’s clearly always known that he’s a boy, but did you ever think at any stage that, it’sjust a phase? Yes, a phase or that he was going to be a kind of a... Tomboy. Yeah, tomboy, masculine girl, whatever. I’ve known since I was really young and I’ve not felt any different for years. So, it can’t be a phase, phases don’t last this long. Ijust knew that he was never going to be happy with the body he had. And, I was right. Ijust want to raise, like, awareness so that other trans people don’t have to go through what I did, because it was like torture. But I think if there’s more awareness out there, so the kids can get accepted quicker. If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, you can find out more on bbc.co.uk/newsbeat. Scientists have come another step closer to discovering how the universe began. A powerful European space telescope has detected the moment stars began to form - around 600 million years after the Big Bang. It was after this key point that galaxies and planets formed, as our science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, reports. The night sky is littered with stars. Discovering when they first appeared could help scientists find out how the universe itself began. Europe’s Planck space telescope has detected a signal which shows when the very first stars began to shine. And this simulation shows what one of them looked like. A gigantic, ferocious fireball. They’re completely different from our sun. These stars are about 1,000 times more massive than the sun and one million times brighter than the sun, and inside these stars the first oxygen and nitrogen is formed, which is the same oxygen and nitrogen that we breathe on Earth. When the universe began, after the Big Bang, it was extremely hot and full of light. 380,000 years later, it cooled and darkened, and that’s how it stayed for hundreds of millions of years, but then the very first stars began to form. The new results tell us that the universe was 600 million years old when star formation really got going. This was the moment that the universe lit up again. This is NASA’s james Webb telescope. It will be able to studyjust how the first stars formed and possibly shed light on what might have existed before the Big Bang. So the idea here is that our universe is notjust our observable universe, but it’s part of a multiverse, where there are universes that may be like our own or may be very different to our own. So our universe is a bubble in a much bigger entity that we call the multiverse. The idea that our universe is one of many is controversial, but in the next few years there may be hard evidence to support this incredible theory. Time for a look at the weather. Here’sjay Wynne. There is a cold wind developing in the south of the United Kingdom. Notably less cold in the far north and west. We will keep a fuse no showers in the small hours down towards Kent and Suffolk -- Sussex, but even those will be clearing away. To start the day tomorrow in the south, it will be cold, frosty and windy. Further north, may be a few patches of fog here and there are, and a lot more cloud around. In the far north of Scotland, just a little bit of rain. But there is very little rain overall in the bmmu very little rain overall in the forecast for Friday. The further south you are, that is where the best of the sunny spells is likely to be. But you do have that cold wind to contend with. It will not be feeling like these temperatures. It will be feeling freezing, or even a couple of degrees below. Further north, temperatures are similar but without that wind. The Six Nations gets under way tomorrow evening and it looks pretty good weather-wise. It will be dry with clear spells, although Chile. Saturday and Sunday dominated by a large area of high pressure. Yes, a lot of cloud in the weekend, but most places will be dry for most of the time. And a lot less cold. Our main headline... Gary Glitter has been found guilty of sexual offences against young girls, one under ten years of age. That is all from us.

Millions of bus passengers have faced another day of disruption, as drivers walked out in an ongoing pay dispute, for the second time in a month. Members of the Unite Union, working for 18 different bus companies, have taken strike action - arguing that they should be paid the same amount for doing the same job. At the moment, staff salaries can vary by thousands of pounds, depending on which bus company employs them. Transport for London, has come under strong criticism for not doing more to solve the problem, as our Transport Correspondent, Tom Edwards reports. A second bus strike and more disrupted journeys. This was Highbury. Not many buses and resignation. It’s annoying and disruptive and affects a lot of people when they do this. I’ve just realised I’m going to have to walk to work now.

At this stage of rush hour, it does, compared to the last strike, feel like more buses are running. Transport for London says A7 percent of services are on the road, compared to just a third during the last strike. Those figures are wildly optimistic, say the unions. This was how Oxford Street looked. All London’s bus routes are to be offered for private tender. The roots of this dispute are in the privatisation of the bus service in London 20 years ago. The unions never wanted it. It means that 18 companies have different rates. Pay for drivers can vary between £17-28,000 a year. The union wants a single pay structure. There is a vast difference between the lowest pay in London and the highest pay. It’s probably in the region of £8-9,000. It’s ridiculous. Everybody is doing the same job. This was Crouch End. The Mayor’s administration is becoming more robust with the unions, and the regulator, Transport for London, won’t intervene, while the individual bus companies say they have no power to change industry structure. The only way it can be resolved is if the union will sit down with people like me and talk about the issues. As long as they refuse to talk and keep calling strikes, I can see this going on indefinitely. This dispute is at a stalemate. Two more strikes are planned. joining me in the studio is Peter Kavanagh from the Unite Union. But first let’s speak to john Trayner, Managing Director of Go-Ahead, London’s largest bus operator with 115 bus routes. Effectively, the argument is that the same job for workers across London should be paid the same amount. That seems a fairly difficult argument to argue against. Absolutely. I can understand why people want to achieve that. I’m a little bit confused myself as to why some of the reasons why we have not done it is unite’s reluctance to talk to us. You are happy to speak to unite? Absolutely. I wrote to them last Thursday. I said Absolutely. I wrote to them last Thursday. Isaid I had Absolutely. I wrote to them last Thursday. I said I had cleared my diary. I was happy to meet any time of the day to resolve the situation. Unfortunately, they did not want to meet me locally. They said the strikes will continue. It seems like at least one side is trying to move things forward. If Mr Trainor was representing all of the bus operators, we might have ",,

This was how Oxford Street looked. All London’s bus routes are to be offered for private tender. The roots of this dispute are in the privatisation of the bus service in London 20 years ago. The unions never wanted it. It means that 18 companies have different rates. Pay for drivers can vary between £17-28,000 a year. The union wants a single pay structure. There is a vast difference between the lowest pay in London and the highest pay. It’s probably in the region of £8-9,000. It’s ridiculous. Everybody is doing the same job. This was Crouch End. The Mayor’s administration is becoming more robust with the unions, and the regulator, Transport for London, won’t intervene, while the individual bus companies say they have no power to change industry structure. The only way it can be resolved is if the union will sit down with people like me and talk about the issues. As long as they refuse to talk and keep calling strikes, I can see this going on indefinitely. This dispute is at a stalemate. Two more strikes are planned. joining me in the studio is Peter Kavanagh from the Unite Union. But first let’s speak to john Trayner, Managing Director of Go-Ahead, London’s largest bus operator with 115 bus routes. Effectively, the argument is that the same job for workers across London should be paid the same amount. That seems a fairly difficult argument to argue against. Absolutely. I can understand why people want to achieve that. I’m a little bit confused myself as to why some of the reasons why we have not done it is unite’s reluctance to talk to us. You are happy to speak to unite? Absolutely. I wrote to them last Thursday. I said Absolutely. I wrote to them last Thursday. Isaid I had Absolutely. I wrote to them last Thursday. I said I had cleared my diary. I was happy to meet any time of the day to resolve the situation. Unfortunately, they did not want to meet me locally. They said the strikes will continue. It seems like at least one side is trying to move things forward. If Mr Trainor was representing all of the bus operators, we might have a way forward. It is one of the biggest. We need to get around the table with all of the operators. One person cannot solve this. We need a sensible, rationalforwhich cannot solve this. We need a sensible, rational for which we can discuss moving the pay structures that we currently have towards a proper pay structure, where people doing the same job can receive the same pay. Is the word is rational and sensible. Do you think it is rational and sensible not to take up an offer from the managing director of the biggest bus company in modern, to not even speak to him? john is being slightly disingenuous because john and myself have actually spoken on at least two occasions, face-to-face, in the last two weeks. john knows that we have been seeking a meeting with all of his colleagues. He went back to the bus operators Forum on two occasions. I thought that in good well and good spirit he would attempt to persuade his colleagues to at least get around the table. We have written a draft framework that would operate within the remit of the law. We need them to agree to start talking to us. This is what Mr Kavanagh once. He wants you to meet with the other bus companies so this can be resolved. -- this is what he wants. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as that. There is little concern as to whether we can actually meet. We are in competition, all of the bus operators, with each other. This problem as to whether you can meet? Absolutely. It’s called a Competition Act. Is managed by the competitions authority. One of the fundamental principles is that if you compete against someone you cannot even YOU COTT’Ipâtâ 3g3iIâ1StSOTT’IâOIâ1â YOU C3I’1I’10tâVâIâ1 Si’13I’â cannot even share information that would lead to collusion, to price-fixing. We have informed unite of that. Our solution was to refer it to the competition and market authority. So the law needs to change in order to solve this strike? Londoners are losing out. Absolutely, which is why I am very keen to meet. I can only meet locally, legally. Iam keen to meet. I can only meet locally, legally. I am keen to do that and resolve this situation. I must apologise, firstly, to the customers. It is not what I want to do, I want to provide a service. I’m keen to resolve this. Thank you. More strike actions are planned. This seems to be a bit of a stalemate. It is ludicrous to suggest that it is unlawful. Asjohn knows, Transport for London also no, it is not unlawful for employers to sit down. Police officers sit down and collectively bargain, as do teachers and nurses. Our union sits down with a lot -- and nurses. Our union sits down with alot-- multitude of employers in the sector. That is fairness and equality. Thank you both. Coming up: 8.6 million Londoners. But we have to start thinking differently about what makes a home? A teacher who sexually abused boys at a prestigious Catholic boarding school in central London has beenjailed for ten years. Southwark Crown Court heard that David Lowe - who’s now retired - took advantage of boys aged between eight and 13 at Westminster Cathedral Choir School. All were emotionally or physically vulnerable. Here’s Ayshea Buksh. For decades, his victims remain silent. After finding courage to speak out, they may now have found peace. David Lowe taught young boys at Westminster Cathedral Choir School and use them while under his care. He wasjailed for ten years after being found guilty of 15 counts of indecent assault. In the docks, he showed no emotion. In sentencing, the judge addressed David Lowe and said that what he did has remained secret. -- David Lowe and said that what he did has remained secret. -- for the best part of 30 years until now. He said that but for the carriage of all ten complainants, and he clearly does most affected, it would have remained a secret. -- most affected, it would have remained a secret. -- for the courage. Some of the victims were as young as eight years old. They have chosen to remain anonymous. The BBC understands they are high profile individuals that include a film maker, at Le Mans, Army Colonel and barrister. According to one of the lead investigators, they went to the police encouraged by the many victims ofjimmy Savile. This case would not have come to our notice if it had not been for Operation Yewtree. The first victim came forward off the back of that and felt the police were taken seriously. This is the schooljust behind Westminster can. It is here where David Lowe worked during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Six of his victims were pupils here. The court heard, during the trial, how he would fondle them during private singing lessons. He molested them in their beds in the dormitory. In a statement, the diocese of Westminster says it co-operated fully with the police. The school now has a rigorous safeguarding policy. During the course of the trial, another victim has come forward. The Met are investigating. Mayor Borisjohnson has been meeting his Parisian counterpart in France - Mayor Anne Hidalgo. The trip was to launch an arts exchange scheme - but after last month’s terror attacks - there was plenty more for the two leaders to talk about, including security issues and freedom of speech. Here’s our Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer. This was the moment, just over a month ago, when gunmen launched their attack on the office of the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris. Another gunman then shot a police officer and went on to kill shoppers at this jewish supermarket... Security has been beefed up in London and Paris. Our security services are constantly in communication. We are trying to see what lessons there are to be learned from the terrible events. Paris’s Mayor etc city is trying to move on from the attacks. Today she signed a cultural pact with her opposite number. The president of trying to pull together. Everyone has been united. The city is now bouncing back. It reminds me very much of how London pulled together after the events of ten years ago. Clearly there is still a problem. This is a very united and strong society. I don’t want people to think that all the funds are extremists. The Mayor is not the only one building links with brilliance. This group went to the French capital to make this message about unity. -- building links with Paris. What we are trying to build within our community is resilience. We are not going to be divided by this. Young people are standing up and saying that we are standing together. That stand against these individuals. Today it was not just the young people standing together. There was much symbolism in this handshake. Still to come before the end of the programme: Cracking down on car theft - the police operation targeting one of the capital’s key routes for criminals. ~ I will be talking to the team behind this business that has expanded internationally and is now addressing the stars of the BAFTAs and the Oscars. -- addressing the stars of the BAFTAs and the Oscars. -- dressing the stars. Now, to continue our series ‘Crowded Capital’ - looking at the pressure being placed upon London as a result of our record population, which hit 8.6 million this week. Tonight, we focus upon homes. As London grows, how will we all live and fit in a city which is becoming busier and busier? Victoria Hollins has been examining some of the options. Climb up above London’s streets and, only then, do you get an idea of the world being built above our heads. As you can see below us, we have the Aldgate Place development. There we have Altitude and Goodman’s Fields, which is a Berkeley homes scheme. On top of the Aldgate Tower, regeneration and rebuilding is clear- where some of the 49,000 homes a year that London needs are being built. It used to be that the commercial towers were the only towers that were granted permission. Nowadays, it’s residential and mixed-use towers that seem to be in favour, particularly because of the housing crisis we have - therefore, the swing towards residential, particularly in city centre locations. During the last population boom of 1939, the tallest building in London was St Pauls. Today, it’s dwarfed on almost all sides. 237 tower blocks are planned for London - the vast majority residential. And they are needed because fitting people in is a growing challenge. You see it reflected back in just how unaffordable a place London is becoming to live. Therefore, we really do need to have all options on the table. It means that densification but it also means thinking about the greenbelt again. After the war, London dealt with housing pressure with tower blocks of a different sort, dotted around the capital in the 50s and 60s. But the tide turned in 1968 when 22 storey Ronan Point collapsed, killing five people. These days, high-rise living looks very different. The 32nd floor of the Lexicon Building on City Road. With this block and another, 600 homes will be created - 30 percent of them affordable. People work in the city itself - it’s high rise. They are used to being on the 30th floor of a building. It is not unusual to come home to the 30th floor of the building. It’s aspirational to live in a tall glass building. But many of them can’t afford it and that’s where social housing providers, like Peabody, come in. They are changing the way they build. At this site in Clapham, there were 300 homes. Once the estate is rebuilt there will be more than 500 in the same space. We have to use space, which is at a premium, to the best effect. What has changed for us in recent years is to create a real mixed design and community, and a real mixed tenures, too. We will have private ownership alongside shared ownership, alongside affordable. But even if developers can get their hands on enough land, labour and cash, there’s still the issue of how crowded Londoners are prepared to see their city get. We are a very low-density city. Density doesn’t always mean that it’s going to be too busy, bustly. It means energy, vitality, lots of amenities. Density has plenty of benefits, as anyone living in New York would know. Whether we start to build differently, whether we build out or up, the decisions made today are going to have implications for generations to come, and will ultimately determine whether London becomes a victim of its own success. With me now is Anna Scott-Marshall from the Royal Institute of British Architects. Thanks forjoining us. Is that the answer? I think towers can be part of the solution. It is really changing the shape of London. We need to be happy about the quality of those towers and whether they are fit for people living in them. There are about 200 towers planned at the moment with 150 being residential. Do you think that’s what people want? Do they want to live in high rises? And we have asked people, they say their top three things are location, access to transport and local public services. The second thing is sufficient inside space. It’s important that the inside of the home is right. Private outdoor space, which often factors out a lot of towers. Clearly, the kind of home we like to live in different depending on our age, ourfamily. We are building a single type of home, really. That probably isn’t accommodating Londoners. There is a limited amount of space. People who are after that smaller space, is the only option to go up? Some towers definitely work. If they’re going to work, we need to really be thinking about not only what they look like, in terms of their appearance on the landscape, but also whether they have amenity facilities, how they interact with the ground. There are also other options. To build densely doesn’t necessarily mean towers. We are not really building homes -- necessarily mean towers. We are not really building homes -- the kinds of homes we are building a suitable for first-time buyers and of homes we are building a suitable forfirst-time buyers and not for first-time buyers and not for people who need a bit of storage. It’s certainly an ongoing problem. Thank you. And for more information on our series ‘Crowded Capital’ - take a look at our website, where there’s an in-depth look at London’s growing population in facts and figures. An estimated 17 cars a day - that’s 6,000 a year- are stolen across London. And according to Scotland Yard it’s an area of crime which is on the rise. So today as part of a campaign to clamp down on vehicle theft, officers have targeted the A13 in east London - because it’s believed to be a key route for criminals. Marc Ashdown has the details. A glove box full of cash, believed to be the proceeds of crime. Only discovered because this car was pulled over, the driver at the latest arrested in Operation Endeavour, set up to tackle the rise in car thefts. We estimate that there are around 70 vehicles a day ‘s Dublin and London. In our top 70% of vehicles taken, vans are in that group. -- In our top 70% of vehicles taken, vans are in that group. -- vehicles Paredes stolen in London. -- vehicles each day. All vehicles are susceptible. The east of the city is a hotspot. This stain is part of a week of action by police. These operations can uncover anything from stolen cars to vehicles without tax or insurance. Earlier today they found some stolen goods and arrested a man from carrying an offensive weapon. They are essentially fishing trips but they can yield good results. One of the problems with keyless theft is the pace of technology. Manufacturers have to make information public so that you and I can get help at a garage when things go wrong, but it does make life easier for criminals. Clearly, legislation is falling into the hands of criminals. We need to have safeguards so that legitimate illnesses have access to that information and can help drivers. In the meantime, the police say we can all take steps like getting a tracking device. Even part-- parking in well populated places. After opening its first shop on Carnaby Street around 50 years ago, ""Ariella"" - a Greek family owned business - has gone from strength to strength. Brenda Emmanus has been finding out the secret of Ariela’s success. Fashion shows are always an exciting and potentially profitable time for design label Ariella. They run a wholesale couture and bespoke business while dressing a host of celebrities for grand entrances at major events. The family business is now based in Finchley but it all began in the 1960s with a small shop in Carnaby Street. This was our first ever dress. It was injersey, a wraparound. They used to say that we were the first company to bring couture to the high street. Mass production fashion in those days was all the same, it was cheap and nasty. In the 60s, we developed the boutiques. We had a string of boutiques that catered for original fashion. This lI8-year business has survived the perilous nature of the fashion industry. Age and experience has handed the reins to young and innovative minds, as Ariella Fashions expands internationally, attracting millions of pounds of orders and celebrity names as fans. His four children have joined the company, with his daughter working alongside him. They are exceptionally large shoes to fill but I have learned from the best. His achievements are unfathomable. I’m trying still to absorb and learn from him. It’s the award season and they are putting the finishing touches to dresses for some star names at the Oscars and BAFTAs. Contractual agreements mean they cannot reveal who. Our gowns are our babies. In return, they are wearing them and looking fabulous on the red carpet. It’s a bit of a two-way street. We have to keep it under wraps but we definitely have some exciting names this year. Whoever wins, they are guaranteed their creativity paraded on the world ‘s most famous red carpets. If you got it so -- felt cold today, tomorrow will be even colder. We have this biting north easterly breeze affecting London through the day. Cold overnight tonight. That could be some icy stretches on the roads. A few sleet and snow showers across parts of the capital. Some cloud early on which is now shifting weight was the West. Clearing drills but where we do have cloud, producing one of two showers. Most wintry showers will be towards Kent. Some icy stretches in the early hours of Friday morning. Temperatures fall below freezing for many areas. It could be as low as -4 -5 in some rural areas. A cult started the day. Watch out for ice will stop quite a hard frost first thing. Through the day, lots of sunshine and dry and settled. Cold wind coming in from the north-east. Temperatures up to around 6 degrees, but the wind will make it feel significantly colder. A subzero feel to the weather during Friday afternoon. A big area of high pressure in charge which is bringing a lot of quiet unsettled weather over the next couple of days. As we had through the course of Friday night, the isobars will ease out as the high pressure builds. We still have the cold wind and chilly conditions first thing. Through Friday night and into the weekend, cloud starts to build in from the North introducing milder air and a few spots of drizzle. Through the day, a cloudy day on Saturday and if you spots of rain. Some drier weather but a cold biting wind by Saturday. Temperatures around six or 7 degrees. It is cold and bright during the course of tomorrow but through into the weekend, cloudy and milder conditions. A mixed bag. Before we go this Thursday evening, a reminder of the day’s main news headlines. Gary Glitter is facing long jail sentence tonight after being convicted of a series of child sex offences, dating back to the 1970s. The former glam rock star- has already served a sentence for possessing images of child abuse. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel and President Hollande That’s it. join me again for our late news tonight during the 10pm news on BBC One. But for now, from everyone on the BBC London team, have a very good evening. Goodbye. # When I see your face # There’s not a thing that I would change # Cos you’re amazing # just the way you are... # Raaarrr! # And when you smile # The whole world stops and stares for a while... # This year for Red Nose Day, do something truly amazing. Good evening. Tonight we celebrate the art of storytelling as we look back 50 years to the first time anybody heard this. jackanory, jackanory. It isjackanory and tonight we have created a new story by piecing together bits of classic episodes. We hearfrom june episodes. We hear from june Whitfield episodes. We hearfrom june Whitfield and Kenneth Williams and many more. We can welcome somebody who has brought many story to life, the award-winning Brenda Blethyn. APPLAUSE. Good evening. These chairs are not comfortable, let’s face it. The old one was worse. It is the film BAFTAs. You were telling us you are rooting for someone who was important when you started out. Two Mike Leigh is getting the fellowship. Long overdue. And I am astonished that Timothy Spall is not in the acting categories. Eddie Redmayne he is fantastic. Do you agree? Michael Keaton is wonderful. You said that Mike Leigh made you the actor you are. Before I worked with him, having worked with him, I realised how lazy I had been before working with him, because you create the characters fully from infancy. You approached the scene with a memory and know everything about that character. You had not been working hard enough? If you are given a script and it does not mention the birthday of the character you do not bother with it but now I have to work that out for myself. Vera, when is her birthday? In April. You almost stitched up. Alex is back from Uganda. Comic Relief. Very close to your heart? I went to Uganda for them in 2013, to a hospital. It was in eastern Uganda close to the border with Kenya will stop it was heartbreaking. People ",,
38,BBC1 London,5-feb-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten, a new peace initiative in Ukraine - as the violence continues to escalate. We report from a devastated town in the east- where pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian troops have fought relentlessly. Every few seconds, every few minutes here, we hear the sound of outgoing fire and also the dull sound of incoming fire. Western leaders gathered in Kiev to push forward a new peace plan, warning that time was running out. We’ll have the latest on the fighting and This is a critical moment for this region, this country, and for the prospects of peace. We’ll have the latest on the fighting and on the diplomatic initiative. Also tonight: The former pop singer Gary Glitter is found guilty of sexually abusing young girls. Health officials say this year’s flu vaccine has been effective in only 3% of cases. BT agrees a deal to buy the UK’s biggest mobile phone operator for more than £12 billion. And we’re on the road, asking why so many young voters will not be taking part in the general election. Tonight on BBC London: Millions of passengers are delayed by striking bus drivers - but more services run than in the last walkout. And the Mayor meets his counterpart in Paris - in a show of solidarity after the recent terror attacks. Good evening. France and Germany have created a new peace initiative which they’re hoping will stop the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Western leaders meeting in Kiev have warned the situation there is sliding towards ""total war"". Months of fighting between government forces and pro-Russian rebels has claimed more than 5000 lives. The hardest battles have been taking place around the eastern town of Debaltseve, where rebels have virtually surrounded Ukrainian troops. In a moment the latest on the diplomatic efforts, but first this report by our correspondent james Reynold, one of the fewjournalists to have reached Debaltseve. The road to Debaltseve is almost empty. The Ukrainian army orders us to drive it as quickly as we can. Rebels have nearly encircled the town. And this is the only way in. We find almost no one on the streets. From the centre of town, we hear the boom of artillery fire. GUNSHOTS The army takes us to visit a bomb shelter in the basements of a music academy. One family takes refuge here. The older man, Alexander, under a blanket, is too weak to be moved. Debaltseve has become too dangerous for most civilians. Most people have simply decided that they have to get out and leave for their own safety. The Ukrainian army is determined to hold this town. It’s vitally important if the government is to stop the rebels from gaining ground. EXPLOSION This woman is getting ready to leave with her 80-year-old father. TRANSLATION: The past two weeks have been especially awful, terrifying. There’s bombing day and night. We just want to live and for our children to have a life. The military bus takes them and others out of town. Towards the front line in Debaltseve, Ukrainian soldiers hold their positions against rebels on the horizon. The smoke is from outgoing Ukrainian fire. This 52-year-old man has given up his job as a doctor on a cruise ship to serve as a military surgeon. This is my home, right? Everybody comes to my home, right? They are guests, they are welcome always. But if somebody comes into my house and starts dictating, do this, do this, what am I going to do? So I will take the gun and shoot him. Soldiers cheer themselves off but their government may be less optimistic. In order to hold its ground here and elsewhere Ukraine says it has to get better weapons from the West. It can’t beat Russia on its own. During the day the US Secretrary of State john Kerry accused Russia of acting with ""impunity"" by crossing the Ukrainian border. He said President Obama was still ""reviewing all options"", including the possibility of providing ""defensive weapons"" to Ukraine, following the dangerous escalation in violence. But the German foreign minister said providing American weapons would be an extremely dangerous option. Our diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall is here with her analysis. Thanks, Huw. Yes, today in response to the escalating war on the ground we saw injames’ report, there’s suddenly been a flurry of hastily arranged diplomacy. An eleventh-hour effort by both the French and German leaders to try to get both Ukraine and Russia to agree to a ceasefire. They flew to Kiev today, they go on to Moscow to see President Putin tomorrow - but it’s still unclear if it’ll be enough to halt this conflict. Donetsk, in the heart of rebel held territory. Once a modern city, now in a state of war. This clinic was shelled yesterday, killing three and injuring many more. Neither streets nor homes are safe. For the residents still living here, it’s a matter of grim survival. Long queues for water and basic foods. It’s a long wait, says this woman, sometimes three or four hours for one food parcel for the whole family. In all, more than 5000 people have died since this conflict began and 1.2 million have fled their homes. What has suddenly raised the alarm over Ukraine’s crisis is the worrying way the conflict has recently escalated, after rebel leaders declared an offensive, apparently to extend beyond the areas they already hold. This week, the rebels have virtually encircled government troops in the key railway hub of Debaltseve. Last month they also seized Donetsk Airport, a symbolic prize as it is now in ruins. There was also shelling in the port of Mariupol and now the fighting seems to be spreading more widely. The Americans are convinced Russia is giving the rebels weapons and manpower, so in Kiev today the US Secretary of State confirmed that President Obama is now considering whether to arm Ukrainians and will make his decision soon. We want a diplomatic resolution, but we cannot close our eyes to tanks that are crossing the border from Russia and coming in to Ukraine. We can’t close our eyes to Russian fighters in unmarked uniforms crossing the border. The Kremlin denies that and today warned that Moscow would view US arms to Kiev as a threat to its security. TRANSLATION: There is no doubt that if this decision is implemented, it could inflict collosal damage to Russian-American relations. Even more so if civilians in Eastern Ukraine start being killed by American weapons. Dismayed at the idea of such an escalation the French and German leaders rushed to Kiev tonight with a new peace plan which they’ll be taking to Moscow tomorrow. We still don’t know what’s in this peace plan - or how viable it is. The Ukrainian Presidency tonight said it gave hope for a ceasefire and the Kremlin has said it’s ready for a constructive discussion. But so many peace talks have been tried and broken down, it’s hard to be optimistic. The former pop singer Gary Glitter has been found guilty of sexually abusing young girls. Glitter, who was tried under his real name, Paul Gadd, has already been to prison in the UK for possessing child abuse images and in Vietnam for sexually assaulting underage girls. Our correspondent Sarah Campbell reports. Glitter’s image now couldn’t be further from the glam rock star of the 1970s. # Do you want to touch me #. His back catalogue is difficult to watch and listen to, knowing what he was doing in private to girls as young as eight years old. # So bring on the girls #. Now aged 70, Glitter, known in court by his real name, Paul Gadd, has heard those girls, now middle-aged women, describe what he did. When the jury returned their verdicts one by one, he shook his head, raised his eyebrows and mouthed, ""No."" Seemingly unable to believe what he was hearing. Paul Gadd has shown himself to be a sexual predator who took advantage of the star status afforded to him by targeting young girls who trusted him and were in awe of his fame. The attacks took place at the height of his success. And one of his victims said in court, he was famous, who would believe her? A second woman took the jury back to Leicester in the 1970s. There was a venue called Bailey’s. She and her mother watched Gary Glitter perform here, met him backstage and he invited them to his hotel suite. She, like the other women involved in this case, sobbed throughout much of her evidence, describing how she found herself alone here with Glitter, drinking champagne and having sexual intercourse with the man whose posters were all over her bedroom wall. He was in his 30s, she was 12. Glitter remained a household name throughout the late ‘70s and ‘80s. It wasn’t until 1997 that his dark side emerged, when a computer he had taken for repair was found to contain images of child abuse. After serving two months in prison, he appeared emotional and contrite. I’ve served my time. I want to put it all behind me. But in 2006, he wasjailed again, this time in Vietnam, for molesting two young girls. I’m innocent, it’s a conspiracy. Speaking for the first time, one of the girls, who was 11 when she was attacked, says she is still traumatised by what he did to her. He grabbed me and dragged me into the bedroom. He did it to me. I didn’t know anything at the time. He looked like a father figure. I didn’t expect that he would do these things, these terrible things. Please do something so he doesn’t commit these crimes again. The one and only Gary Glitter. Two men connected by their celebrity and as we now know a desire to abuse children. Not long afterjimmy Savile’s dramatic fall from grace, Glitter became the first high-profile arrest by officers investigating historical sexual abuse. Tonight, he’s in custody and the police are looking into further allegations against him. Glitter’s final years may well be spent behind bars. The German Finance Minister says Greece must respect existing agreements on the terms of its international bailout. Wolfgang Schaeuble was speaking after talks in Berlin with his Greek counterpart, Yanis Va roufa kis. Mr Schaeuble said that a reduction of Greece’s debt was off the agenda and that they’d failed to agree on the matter. But Mr Varoufakis urged Germany to help end what he called the ‘gross indignity’ of the Greek debt crisis. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston is with me. How did that meeting go? Pretty badly. This was important to woo the eurozone governments to let the country off some of its debts, to ease off on austerity. Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German Finances Minister, the pay master of the eurozone, said that they agreed to disagree, Yanis Varoufakis said that the talks were not even as constructive as that. That they never got down to the nitty-gritty. So this was pretty dire. Where does it leave us when we look at the bigger picture across the eurozone? It is all gloomy. The big problem at the moment is that Greek banks are losing money. People are taking their money out because of the risk that the Greeks will leave the eurozone, euros in that country, will converted into weaker drachmas, if you have savings in a Greek bank, you are going to lose money. That is a problem of insufficient finances for the Greeks banks made worse when the European Central Bank said last night that it would restrict the supply of Central Bank money to Greek, to Greek banks. So a fairly major crisis appears brewing. The clock is ticking for a compromise to be found. When I talked to officials and politicians across Europe, they mutter that they still think that a compromise agreement is there but they also say, and I have not really heard them say this throughout the crisis, that there is now a meaningful risk of Greece withdrawing from the eurozone. That would shatter confidence across the region, growth would, the tiny amount that there is, it would disappear. It is not just bad news for them but for us, it is still our biggest export market, our biggest trading partner. Thank you very much. Health officials have said this year’s flu vaccine has been effective in only 3% of cases. The strain of the virus circulating in Britain this winter is especially harmful to the elderly. The vaccine would normally be expected to protect far more people. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym reports. If you have had your flu jab this winter, the message is it is a lot less effective than it should be. That is because a strain of the virus, covered by the vaccine has mutated, so there is no longer protection against it. The elderly are vulnerable to the strain. There has been an increase in cases amongst the over 65s. Public health experts admit that they were taken by surprise. Flu is a virus that is constantly changing, mutating. It happens. Normally we get warning, we are able to anticipate it. This year there has not been a warning. No flu vaccine can offer complete protection. In a normal winter it is 50% effective amongst those exposed to the virus with the jab. But this winter it isjust 3% to the virus with the jab. But this winter it is just 3% effective, based on tests on a sample of patients. As it happens, the number of deaths from all causes in England and Wales, was more than 45,000 in the first three weeks of this year. That is a lot higher than the average of just over 34,000 over the same period in recent years. Health experts say flu and cold weather were probably factors behind the increase. The advice to elderly people who have had the injection and may now be worried about getting flu is that help is available if they feel the symptoms there are antiviral drugs available through the GPs. If you are one of the vulnerable groups that has a preexisting illness, for example, someone over 65. That is the time then to ask your doctor or practise for help. ADVERTISEMENT: If you have a health condition, even one that is well-managed, catching the flu can cause you serious complications. If you have not had the flu jab, doctors say it is worth doing so as it covers other strains that are circulating. But the ineffectiveness of many cases this year helps to explain the pressure that built up on hospitals this year. jordan says dozens of its fighter jets have carried out air strikes on Islamic State extremists in Syria. It said the planes targeted ammunition dumps and training camps. jordan, which had promised to take revenge for the murder of a captured pilot by IS, said the air strikes were ‘just the beginning’ of its response. The Liberal Democrats have outlined plans for £8 billion worth of tax rises, targeting wealthy individuals and big business, after the next general election. Nick Clegg said his party would aim to clear Britain’s deficit in three years with a mixture of higher taxes, spending cuts and by reducing tax avoidance. He said the LibDems would cut less than the Conservatives and borrow less than Labour. Our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale reports. The parties have reached a fork in the road. They know the deficit has to be eliminated but don’t agree how. So for voters there is a choice of which way to go. Today, high up in Britain’s tallest building, Nick Clegg came to say how he would cut the deficit down to size. Like the Tories, he wants to find £30 billion to balance the books by 2017. But... only the Liberal Democrats can guarantee stability and fairness. Only the Liberal Democrats can offer light at the end of the tunnel. We will cut less than the Conservatives and borrow less than Labour. So how will he do that? He would find £16 billion from more spending and welfare cuts. £6 billion from curbing tax avoidance and £8 billion from new tax rises and business on the rich. There would be a mansion tax and high levy on banks and fewer tax breaks on large firms but no increase in income or Corporation Tax rates, VAT or National Insurance. How can you guarantee that middle income earners will not be hit by these taxes? We are absolutely clear. We do not mean to, in our plans, mean to increase VAT, National Insurance, income tax or indeed Corporation Tax. But he said that the Lib Dems would raise capital gains tax, potentially to about 35%. We think we can go further on that and align capital gains tax and income tax more closely. That generates hundreds of millions of pounds. Ed Miliband says Labour would balance the nations books as soon as possible but is yet to say precisely how. George Osborne, out fixing walls with apprentices in Yorkshire, says he will fix the deficit mostly by cuts but today would not even respond to the Lib Dem plans. There is a real choice in this election, it is between David Cameron in Downing Street and Ed Miliband in Downing Street. Richmond is a wealthy corner of south-west London and a marginal seat that the Lib Dems need to win back from the Tories. I think that the rich should pay a little more. Do you think mansion tax all the way? Yeah, Ido. I am cautious about raising taxes I think we have to understand what the impact is first. The Liberal Democrats are finished, so I don’t mind what they say. The Lib Dems are notjust saying that they trying to fix the would try to fix the deficit more fairly. They are also saying there is light at the end of the tunnel, austerity does no the have to go on forever. But with the party on 7% in the polls, the question is whether anyone is listening. The Lib Dems need the political tide to turn in their favour and they need it soon. As many as 8,000 18 to 21-year-olds will not be able to vote in the General Election because they’re not on the electoral register. Today is National Voter Registration Day, which is meant to encourage more people to sign up to vote. An opinion survey for the Electoral Reform Society found that 24% of 18 to 21-year-olds haven’t registered to vote. Another 9% had no idea whether they were on the register. Our Political Editor Nick Robinson has spent the day with young voters speaking to those who’ve already decided not to vote in May’s election and those who will be voting for the first time. That’s what today, National Voters Registration Day, is all about. I brought my blocks to the hair salon, to ask a group of apprentices if they are going to bother. Do you agree there is no point in voting, if so, vote yes, or you think, there really is a point in voting, in which case vote no. I’m going to have to tick the first one. For somebody of 27, I have never voted in my life. I havejust never believed in it. You can vote but at the end of the day I don’t think that all of the votes get taken into consideration. There is no point in voting? Sorry. Have you ever voted ? Yes, I have. It never comes true. Call it apathy, call it disaffection, call it what you like. Today is about trying to answer to trying to answer it. Up and down the country, campaigners are trying to make sure people get the chance to vote. That means getting your name on the register. You used to be able to rely on the college or the student union or mum or dad to do it, not now. It is now down to you as the individual. It’s an easy process. It takes three minutes. Search online, register to vote and go straight to the Government tool and get involved. But you cannot rely on someone else to do it for you? No, it is down to you. Parliament is backing a campaign that’s got added urgency. The new system of individual registration is making an old problem worse. At the last election almost half of those under 25 didn’t register to vote. But almost all pensioners did. And that really matters. There’s a huge gap between the number of young people registered to vote and the number of old people. So when it comes to making cuts, who do you think it is easier for the politicians to target? Which is one reason why many are ignoring those, like Russell Brand, who say there is no point in voting. Why are you clear that there is a point in voting? It depends who is in power that dictates what is going on today for ourselves, for everyone. Thinking about it deeply, there is a point in it. It is our future at the end of the day. I understand why people feel there is no point but I agree that there is a point. There is somebody at home thinking she is talking nonsense, there is no point in voting. Tell them. I feel if you want to change something, you have to be a part of something. You have to get involved, you have to educate yourself on it and you have to make a change from inside. It is all good and well having an opinion, saying no-one listens, but if you are not there to be listened to, who is going to listen? It’s your choice who to vote for but if you don’t register, the choice is gone. BT has agreed the terms of a $12.5 billion dollar deal to buy the UK’s biggest mobile phone operator, EE. The takeover, which is subject to approval by BT’s shareholders and by the Competition and Markets Authority, would create a huge business covering fixed-line phones, broadband, mobile and TV. Our Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan-jones has more details. Well if the deal does go through it will create a hugely powerful company in communications. Some say too powerful. BT has 10 million customers, landline and broadband. EE brings to the party, 24. 5 million mobile phone customers. So together, BT will have what is noun as quad play. One operator can offer mobile phone, fixed line, broadband all in a package. BT say that is good for the customers it is confident it will get this through the regulators but rivals say that BT will have too much power. In particular, it will have an Open Reach division, that controls the firebrand networks down which e-- which they run their calls, their data. So the rivals would like to see that split off. They are demanding that from the regulator. The regulator has a lot to think about here. Thank you very much.

Bryan Williams, one of the most familiar faces on American television and presenter of NBC Nightly News, has had to broadcast an apology after admitting that a story he often told about coming under fire in Iraq 12 years ago was untrue.

Now it is his reputation that is suffering collateral damage, after this embarrassing on-air apology. I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologise.

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC, helped wealthy clients to evade paying millions of pounds in tax. The BBC’s Panorama programme has seen details of thousands of accounts from HSBC’s private bank in Switzerland, leaked by a whistle-blower eight years ago. They show that bankers helped their clients to evade tax, and that they offered deals to help those clients stay ahead of the law. HSBC has admitted that some clients did hold undeclared accounts, but said the bank had now ""fundamentally changed."" The government is due to make a statement to the Commons this afternoon. Our economics correspondent Andrew Verity reports. HSBC told parliament in 2008 that it prohibited its bankers from being involved in tax evasion but we now know that bankers helped clients cheeked tax for it is the world over. In 2007 an employee of its Swiss private bank subsidiary stole thousands of secret documents relating to more than £6 billion held by wealthy individuals. 7000 of them were British. The documents included bankers notes showing some accounts were illegally not declared to the taxman. One banker said his clients’s preoccupation was with the risk of disclosure to the Irish authorities but there is no risk of that happening. Another said the attorney being in a law office does not want to sign on an undeclared Swiss account. There are many cases where they turn a blind eye and others when they encourage them to evade tax. By suggesting how to get money out of the country tax-free, suggesting setting up shell companies are receiving, rather than receive it in the customer’s own name. Evidence had been passed to UK tax Boruc is by May 2010, but instead of facing investigation Stephen Green, the Mame Biram Diouf bank and chaired the Swiss subsidiary was declared a lord and David Cameron gave him a job as a trade Mr. Panorama caught up with him. Your bankers helped people dodge tax, why did you let them do that? As I have explained I’m not prepared to make any comments on HSBC’s business past or present. You have two because the taxpayer was missing out because of things you allowed to happen, how can you defend that? I will not make any comment on HSBC. Rather than using the evidence to prosecute the bank or its clients Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs told account customers in 2011 that they wouldn’t be prosecuted. Instead it encouraged them to settle, something the government defence. Some £135 million has been recovered by HMRC in tax, interest and penalties. We will continue to take strong action. HMRC will continue to investigate the list. HSBC says it has overhauled its practices since the data was released but critics say tax evaders have been let off lightly. So far, we’ve only had one prosecution of somebody in the courts. If you think if this had been benefit scrounging they would have been queueing around the courts to have their cases heard. His massive detail data has been delved into by governments from the US, to Belgium, to Argentina who are investigating and prosecuting HSBC. But in the bank’s home country, the UK, no investigation is ongoing. Panorama’s Richard Bilton is in Belfast. Richard, how significant are these revelations? I think they are incredibly significant because we haven’t seen anything like this before, not anything on this scale. 100,000 files from all over the world. It’s the access, seeing inside a private bank. When you look at these files and delve into them, it’s clear that the bankers who were breaking the law never fought anybody would see, never thought anybody would find out. We have seen, and it’s quite clear that they were happy to break the law. Richard, you’ve spoken to various whistle-blowers in this case, what else have they said? HSBC have said they have changed, they’ve had this overhaul of the private banking business. But I met a whistle-blower who worked for HSBC as a compliance officer, an executive compliance opposite in the private bank in Luxembourg. She lost herjob in the summer of 2013, she says, because she raised too many concerns about what the bank was doing then. I put to her that the bank had said to panorama that things had changed and she said they hadn’t changed. She said the verbal message sounded great but they won’t put into practice and that disturbed me greatly. Many thanks, Richard Bilton. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed is here. Why haven’t there been more formal investigations here when there have been abroad? I’ve spoken to HMRC this morning, they are the tax collectors for the UK. Their approach is that it is better to take what are called civil actions, where the burden of proof is slightly lower than a criminal and is, because that means there is much more chance of getting money paid back to the tax authorities in the UK, than trying to take complicated and very expensive prosecutions. People may remember the Guinness trial, the Maxwell fraud trial, these trials can go on for many, many years and HMRC claim that there may not be success at the end in any case. That is a judgement that HMRC made and has been supported by the government. Clearly they are coming under quite a lot of pressure to date to be more aggressive. There is also the role of the Financial Conduct Authority, the bank regulator, what action have they taken? Very And you can see the full story by the International Consortium of Investigative journalists, Le Monde, the Guardian and Panorama this evening on BBC1 at 8:30pm. The worsening conflict in eastern Ukraine will dominate talks between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Obama at the White House this afternoon. Germany and France are leading efforts to secure a new ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists. The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has blamed Ukraine and the West for the ongoing violence. Our world affairs correspondent Emily Buchanan reports. Overnight in Donetsk, the sky lights up as a chemical plant explodes, struck by heavy shelling. The rebels blame Ukrainian government forces. Not much sign here of an impending peace deal. TRANSLATION: Everybody saw the globe and everybody felt the shock WAVE. The explosion happened at the state-owned chemical plant. There is an investigation being carried out. When the missile or rocket is found it will be laid out so everyone can see it. Another bleak morning here with the news that at least nine more people had died in the last 24 hours. 5,300 have been killed since the violence began in April and over1 million displaced. The danger of the conflict widening has re-energised efforts to find a diplomatic solution. Officials are laying the groundwork in Berlin today before Wednesday’s crucial peace summit in Minsk. But amongst EU foreign ministers in Brussels, there is still scepticism that this latest initiative will succeed where others have failed. We are delighted that there are negotiations and discussions going on. But until we see Russia complying on the ground, withdrawing troops, closing the border, stopping the flow of weapons, we can’t relieve the pressure in any way. We need to keep that pressure up until we see notjust words on paper but deeds on the ground. So far the deeds on the ground are an acceleration of the rebel advance. This is another town seized on the way to the strategic city of Debaltseve. The separatist forces may be hoping to secure key positions before a deal is announced. And it’s not clear if even then they would put down their weapons. Patience with Russia is running out in Washington as influential voices call for arms to be sent to the Ukrainian forces. But Angela Merkel who has arrived for a meeting with President Obama will be nervous of anything that could escalate the war. Our world affairs correspondent james Reynolds has reached the outskirts of Donetsk and the town of Vuhlehirsk - which has now been taken by Russian separatist fighters. This is the town of Vuhlehirsk, and it is now held by rebels supported by Russia. What you’re seeing here is a Ukrainian armoured personnel carrier, a casualty of the battle for this town, which was won by the rebels just a few days ago. little and look at the ~ -- and look at the site. This building is almost entirely burnt out. And as we walk through the streets here I don’t see anyone, I don’t see any civilians. We’d had to come here with the rebels themselves. That’s the only way you can get access to the town, but normal people have gone. It’s no surprise why, because we are very close to the front line. If we walk down here to this road this is the road towards Debaltseve, which is still held by Ukrainian government forces and you can see the rebels there midway through the road. The rebels look like they have ambitions to carry on fighting. We’ve seen them load up weapons, we’ve seen them resupply themselves, and they do not want to give up any of the ground that they’ve taken. They fought for this area and they say that they want to keep it and they don’t want to give it up back to Kiev in any kind of deal. And further than that, they appear to have ambitions to keep going. The rebels want to try to take Debaltseve because it’s a crucial strategic hub. They want to get as much ground as they can. They want to lock down what they’ve got and make sure that they don’t give it up in any kind of peace agreement. That wasjames That was james Reynolds. Cameron has chaired a meeting of senior officials to discuss the impact on the UK of a possible Greek exit from the Eurozone and to take steps that British banks and companies will not be excessively damaged if it happens. Robert Peston is here with me. This is a sign that a possible Greek exit is being taken seriously. It is. Today I learned that the Prime Minister met with the head of the Treasury, the chap who is in charge of Financial Stability Board a representative of the Bank of England as well because he feels he has to take the steps to protect British businesses, British banks, the economy. From what would be a pretty big shock if Greece were to leave the euro. That is now looking more of a risk following the speech by Alexa Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister, to the Greek Parliament yesterday -- Minister, to the Greek Parliament yesterday -- Alexa Tsipras. In which his position that austerity has to end hardened, which puts him at loggerheads, particularly with the German government but frankly with most governments within the Eurozone. So it is looking increasingly hard to see where a compromise can be reached. So that Greece can feel that it can do the things that it wishes to do in sums of things like rehiring civil servants, increasing the minimum wage and stay in the Eurozone. Most of the people that I talk to, senior officials and ministers, who believe that a compromise can still be found, because the damage to Greece over Eurozone exit would be significant but at the moment no one can quite tell me where the deal is and what the scope for compromise might be. Robert, many thanks. Users of social media who spread racial hatred should be banned from sites such as Twitter and Facebook. That’s according to a group of MPs, who are urging the Crown Prosecution Service to use existing powers to block online access to people who commit hate crimes. Last week, a report said anti-Semitic incidents in the UK more than doubled last year. Our religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt reports. At Hadley Wood jewish community many are aware that anti-Semitic abuse online is hard to police, but can be corrosive. There has to be zero tolerance of anti-Semitism in all its forms. The smallest tweet or post on Facebook is what engenders these things. The recent killings in Paris where a grim reminder that such hatred doesn’t always stop online. I feel very British and I don’t want to feel that is being threatened. She is the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor and has two young children. There is an element of worry for my children and their safety in the future, albeit it might be slightly irrational. Any mother that says they don’t worry for their child’s future would be a bit worrying in itself. But, yes, unfortunately I do and I do worry if they wear a kipa on their heads or a skull cap, orthey they wear a kipa on their heads or a skull cap, or they go to a cinema or a jewish youth club or Hebrew classes. Now, MPs and peers have looked closely at what more can be done to clamp down on anti-Semitism, close to a record level during the conflict in Gaza with over 1000 incidents last year alone. The report cites notjust the levels of physical or verbal abuse face to face, but also the increase in anti-Semitism online, saying that its growth on social media is a serious and growing concern.

Coming up in the sport, England beat the West Indies by nine wickets in Napoli ultimate World Cup -- the West Indies by nine wickets in Napoli ultimate World Cup -- in their penultimate World Cup warm up act. They needed just half of the overs to complete victory in Sydney. Seven houses built mainly from straw will be the first of their kind to go on the open market in the UK this month. The team which has helped build the homes says they’re much more affordable. Here’s our Science Reporter Victoria Gill. In England alone we are only building half of the new homes we need but to meet rising demand throughout the UK do we need to think differently about the materials we build with? Like these new houses in Bristol that are 80% straw. They are the first straw bale homes in the UK to go on the open market, so any buyer can make an offer. Crucially the technique is certified as safe and mortgage a bull, and the team hopes this sale will be a tipping point to move building from straw from a pet project for the ecological we minded into the mainstream. Theron misconceptions about using straw, concerns about fire resistance -- there are misconceptions. Things about fire, and we have shown it is robust and a safe form of construction. It is also a sustainable material we can grow, the leftover stalks from cereal crops. Nearly A million tonnes of surplus straw are produced every yearin surplus straw are produced every year in the UK. It takesjust over seven tonnes to build a three-bedroom house. It means there are potentially enough material for half a million homes every year in the British fields. As it grows it absorbs CO2, so the more buildings we can create from these materials are less CO2 there will be in the atmosphere. Like all of the straw bale homes built in the UK up to now this cooperative housing project in leads was specially commissioned. In this very clean lined modern development you don’t get much of an impression of building from straw -- in Leeds. This is one of the guest rooms and it has a feature wall, through the pain of glass you can see the straw bales that all of the homes are built from. Paul co-founded the development and moved in two years ago, it’s proved to be a test case for the practical advantages of straw bale walls. Typically for a year we have about £200 energy bills per year, £1+00 combined electricity and gas for a four-bedroom house, it’s an believable discount compared to houses. The same architects now have permission to build 50 more straw bale houses like these, they hope the developments will start a new trend in affordable field grown homes.

Egypt has indefinitely suspended football league matches after at least 22 fans died in a stampede at a stadium in Cairo. Many of the victims were crushed after police fired tear gas at supporters of Zamalek football club, who were trying to force their way into the ground. The fans blamed the authorities for opening only a single gate to let them in. Our correspondent Orla Guerin is in Cairo. This isn’t the first time in Egypt that violence and crowd-control at a football match has claimed lives? Indeed not, it’s only three years since there was an after match riot in the city of Port Said claimed the lives of 75 football fans come after that there was restrictions in the Egyptian Premier League. Ironically last night this was the time their fans were last night this was the time their fa ns were allowed fans were allowed back into see their club play. There’s no doubt the dead were killed in a stampede, they died from crushing injuries, theissueis they died from crushing injuries, the issue is who was to blame for the stampede is taking place? The fans insist the authorities mishandled the situation. By restricting the entrance to just a single database caused pushing and shoving and a gate fell over, and a stampede began -- shoving and a gate fell over, and a stampede began -- just a single gate. The police fired tear gas... The police said the fans themselves were to blame for trying to storm the stadium and enter without tickets. Thank you forjoining us sorry about the quality of the line. Ed Miliband says a Labour government would double the amount of paid paternity leave, from two weeks to four weeks. Statutory paternity pay would also go up by more than £120 a week to £260 a week, paid for by savings in tax credits. Business leaders have opposed the measure, saying there would be costs on employers, potentially affecting jobs and growth. Our correspondent Alison Freeman is at a play centre in Greater Manchester. There have been mixed reactions to the Labour plans to double paternity leave, some business leaders saying it will damage small businesses. Because they will be forced to buy in cover. The families we’ve spoken to here this morning say they welcome the plans. In a room full of mums and children at this play centre in Manchester Kevin Buckley is one of only a couple of dads. He works as a manager at a fast food chain, and took the full two weeks paternity leave when his daughter was born almost two years ago. He says he would be happy to take the four weeks Labour says it would give if the party gets into government. It’s very important because I know mY It’s very important because I know my wife and I was going back to work, after two weeks, quite nervous. It’s not enough time for any father, for any parent to get their child into a routine. It’s important. To spend more time with their child. The plan on the whole has been welcomed by mums, too. Anything which gets a father to have more time with their kids, can only be a good thing. Especially if you have more children, you need extra support. Underthe plans, dads would not only be offered twice as much time off, but statutory paternity PHY time off, but statutory paternity pay would also nearly double, to two june £60 per week, matching the minimum wage -- june £60 per week, matching the minimum wage -- £260. It saves money the government in tax credits, the government would be paying out less in tax credits and the money would increase the pay for fathers, it’s the right policy and shows if we change the way the economy works and provide greater flexibility it will help parents and the economy. But the plans have not proved as popular with some businesses who have called it a business tax. What about the small businesses, how do we manage when our staff are away for longer periods of time? We can’t afford to employ access staff to cover. For events when people are off. There would be no obligation to take up the offer, but Labour says the current system is outdated with only just over half of new fathers taking the full two weeks off because of financial pressures. The new system of shared parental leave comes into force in April and the Tories have said they support flexibility for parents. STUDIO: Thank you forjoining us. Eddie Redmayne was named Best Actor at last night’s BAFTA awards ceremony in London for his portrayal of the physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything. And Boyhood - the story of a boy’s coming of age that took more than a decade to make - has won this year’s award for Best Picture. Our Entertainment Correspondent Lizo Mzimba reports - his reports contains some flash photography. It is one of the biggest nights in the film calendar. With stars of every kind turning out to see who won what. The BAFTA goes to The Theory of Everything. The Theory of Everything, about physicist Stephen Hawking and his then wife jane, did well, taking home four awards, including Best British Film and Best Actor for Eddie Redmayne. It feels amazing, particular amazing to have Stephen here, to share it with him and joan and jonathan. It is their story really. The film that collected the most was quirky comedy The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Ralph Fiennes. There were also awards for Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay. Also doing well was Boyhood, an extraordinary movie filmed over more than a decade, showing the young boy growing into a young man. It won Best film and best director. For the winners, tonight is notjust about the honour of being recognised by fellow professionals, it also reflects how well they do at the Academy Awards, and in particular, Eddie Redmayne is now the firm favourite to take home the Best Actor Oscar in two weeks. Britain’s Sam Smith has triumphed at the Grammys in California. The 22 year old singer picked up four awards - including Best New Artist, and Record of the Year for ""Stay with Me"". He is the only solo artist to sell more than a million albums in the UK and the US in 2011+ - eclipsing Beyonce and Pharrell Williams, who each walked away with three awards. This is the BBC News at one. It is 1:29pm. Top story. Britain’s biggest bank HSBC helped wealthy clients to sidestep paying tax, depriving the Treasury of millions of pounds. In a moment, we’ll have a full national weather forecast - plus the news where you are. But first Huw Wuzencroft with some sports news. The Wales squad are back together after their defeat to England in their opening Six Nations game. The main talking point of the match centres around concussion and medical protocol after George North suffered two blows to the head during the game. I’m joined by Wales correspondent Hywel Griffith. There has been real criticism of the decision to allow North to carry on playing, hasn’t there Hywel? Yes. A chorus of criticism over the weekend added to this morning by some big names within the game, Brian Moore writing in the papers, questioning the decision to play on George North and Will Carling said rugby in general needs to take head injuries more seriously. If we look at back footage from Friday night’s game at the millennium Stadium in the first half George North took a foot to the head. The medical staff clearly saw that and treated him on the pitch and he was taken away to the dressing rooms to have a full eight minute assessment. At the end of the eight minutes he came back onto the pitch. In the second half he took a heavy blow to the head. If you look at it he potentially looks like he lost consciousness for a second or two on the way down. That incident wasn’t seen by the medical staff and he played on without being taken back off the pitch for another assessment. It’s the effect of both injuries people are questioning, whether he should have come back after the first one and weather really after the second one someone shouldn’t have intervened. The Welsh Rugby union say he has been treated now as a concussion injury player but there are no symptoms and no signs to show he had any long-term damage. He is being considered as fit and normalfor damage. He is being considered as fit and normal for next weekend’s clash with Scotland. Thanks, we will see if he makes it into that game. In the Women’s Six Nations Wales opened their campaign with a 13-0 win over the World Champions England in Swansea. A new-look England side, including seven new caps - struggled to cope. Laurie Harries scored Wales’ second try to seal a famous victory. England have won their penultimate World Cup warm-up match with a convincing nine-wicket victory against the West Indies, before they face Australia in their opening game of the tournament on Saturday. It was a very good morning for Chris Woakes. He took two wickets in the first over and finished with figures of 5-19 as the West Indies were bowled out forjust 122. 1+6 from Moeen Ali and 35 not out from Ian Bell helped England reach their target with more than half of their 50 overs remaining. Legendaryjockey AP McCoy says he wants to give something back to the sport after announcing this season will be his last in the saddle. The 19-time champion jockey will retire by the end of the season April and has ridden more winners than any otherjockey - more than 1+,300. ~ I will not be bitter about the fact I cannot write any more. I’m well aware that this happens to everyone. If it was this year or next year, I know that when I give up there is going to be a good horse I could have ridden and if I’d kept going that might have been the same if I’d kept going for another five years, they would have been another good horse. Racing has been very good for me so I’d like to stay within racing and trying to do whatever good I can for the sport. Ivory Coast won the Africa Cup of Nations after beating Ghana in a dramatic penalty shootout after a goalless draw. It went to sudden death and all the way to the keepers. Ghana’s Breema Razak couldn’t convert. And the Ivory Coast keeper Boubacar Barry sealed his hero status as his side celebrated just their second ever Cup of Nations win. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. Thank you very much. David Beckham has signed up to another ten years as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations children’s charity, UNICEF. The former footballer said that after retiring, he now had more time to help the world’s children; and he believed his fame would enable him to ""open doors"". Our sports correspondent Katie Gornall has been to meet him. Her report contains flash photography throughout. Wherever David Beckham goes his face and fame is a source of fascination Unicef a force for good. His work for the charity has taken him to some of the world’s most devastated places, from war-torn Sierra Leone to the Philippines in the aftermath of a deadly typhoon. David Beckham. Today David Beckham launched a new fund called Seven, focusing on seven countries where children are most at risk. You meet people who have lost family members, their children, and they want to see smiles, they want to see people that are going to help their family, to see people that are going to help theirfamily, their children, and their family, their children, and help theirfamily, their children, and help rebuild their home, help with their children’s education, help with their children staying alive. That’s one of the reasons why I’m proud to be involved in this, because I am able to help. Both in and out of football his influence has been enormous. His every kick lauded, every fashion followed. After ten years as a goodwill ambassador this is a personal crusade for the father of fore, who says his profile gives him a powerful voice. says his profile gives him a powerfulvoice. I powerful voice. I consider down in a room full of children and they listen to me. They listen to me because I’ve played with Zinedine Zidane, I’ve played with Wayne Rooney, they listen to me because I’ve played for Manchester United or Real Madrid. That’s the strength of being the person I am. When David Beckham walks into a room the world certainly seems to take notice. Now as he enters the next stage of his post-football career he hopes that Spotlight can help those who need it most. Let’s take a look at the weather with Darren Bett. It’s a quiet week ahead and high pressure will shape our weather. This is where it is at the start of the week and although we are all under the same area of high pressure the weather will vary from place to place. This morning we were sent a lovely sunny picture by Alison in County Durham which was the warmest place in the country. In the Sunshine week saw temperatures into double figures and over the next few days it will feel pleasant but if you are stuck under the cloud it will be nearer five or 6 degrees and they will be a different feel. This is how the cloud has shaped up so far today, is how the cloud has shaped up so fartoday, plenty far today, plenty of sunshine in eastern parts of the UK and this is where it will stay sunny for the rest of the day. The cloud is breaking in the south-east and through the Midlands we will see more sunshine and in mid-south Wales and in the south-west. West there is more cloud and a few spots of rain in western Scotland possible. Otherwise it is to ride today and overnight, the clearer skies still around for eastern areas but cloud amounts will increase for Wales, the south-west and the south-east of England but quite a chilly night where you have clearer skies and temperatures will fall away below freezing again. Heading into the rush hour tomorrow no major problems really. We could have a touch of frost in Wales, mid-Wales, possibly the south-west, some patchy fog like this morning. There is more a signal for patchy fog and low cloud in the south-east of England but any fog further north and the eastern side of England should be fleeting. We will see sunshine coming through, more cloud for the West of England, Northern Ireland, with a mild start and cloud in the West of Scotland could produce some spots of rain. Otherwise it is dry, quite a cold start for the north-east of Scotland but it will warm up in the sunshine. A similar dated today -- a similar dated today. A slow start in the south-east, we may see sunshine developing from time to time in the south-west but the sunny skies will be in the eastern side of the UK. In the sunshine it will feel almost like early spring but under the clouds temperatures nearer five or six or 7 degrees. In the middle part of the week there is a tendency thanks to the south-westerly breeze to introduce more cloud, less sunshine, still sunny in the far north-east but we get more cloud in the north-west because the cloud is pulling away into the near continent and later in the week the pressure will fall, this area of low pressure is quite nasty and is heading our way but I think it will fizzle out as it gets to ask a lot of doubt about that. But most places should be fine and dry this week. It is all about the sunshine but where you have clear skies at night they will be patchy fog and frost. Thank you very much. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Britain’s biggest bank HSBC helped wealthy clients sidestep paying tax - depriving the Treasury of millions of pounds. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Katharine Carpenter. Boris johnson has announced proposals to redesign some of London’s busiest roads by tunnelling under the city. During a visit to the USA, the Mayor’s been visiting the country’s biggest underground highway project. He’s earmarked five sites where a similar scheme might work here. Our political correspondent Karl Mercer reports from Boston. They are clearing the roads of snow in Boston as the city faces one of its worst winters in living memory. Nearly 25 years ago removing vehicles here wasn’t just to do with the snow. The city hatched an ambitious plan to put its flyovers underground. Ten years ago I could have shouted from the snow under a six-lane motorway which ran through the centre of Boston. But in 2007 that all changed. ~ -- sheltered from the snow. Something called the big dig took place, that took the motorway from up there down beneath my feet into a five-lane each-way than tunnel through the heart of the city. But it was described by one critic as America’s biggest highway robbery. Because it was well over time and well overbudget. Nine years later, in fact, and 20 billion overbudget. The message from the mayor’s office, it’s time to get out of Dodge! It’s that last sentiment that has brought the mayor here. In some of this snowy scene is a public garden. The traffic now hidden. Is this the best example to try and follow? Nine years late, £20 billion over budget. Well, yes. I mean, it’s a very good example of what you can do. Yes, I agree there are particular issues which I’m sure you should raise with people here about what went wrong. There is no question things went wrong, it did go over budget and things did take too long. But, look at it in the end, they love it here now. The mayor has asked Transport for London to look at five sites across the capital where this sort of scheme could be used. Including here at the Hammersmith flyover. By the 2020s he’d like to see them looking like this. But he’d expect drivers and local businesses to pay through tolls and rates. These are the tunnels of the big dig under Boston, but the driver who took us to meet up with the mayor was less convinced it had all been worth it and had some words of caution for London. When there’s money around this is the way we used to say, when the gangsters were around they used to think your money was theirs. Now the government got rid of the gangs, now there is the government of the gangsters and they think your money is theirs. That’s the theory. Karl Mercer, BBC London News, Boston. A cyclist who was killed in London on Friday night has been named as 26-year-old Frederica Baldassa, an Italian living in Stepney. She was hit by a truck at a junction on Bloomsbury Square. London’s air ambulance was sent but she died at the scene. BBC London has found that the black market in making and selling illegal alcohol is growing. Some of the drinks made in the capital have an alcohol content of 90%. Drinking it can be fatal and put a strain on the London’s health services. health problem, you could have kidney disease, liver disease and you might not wake up at all. And you can see more on this on Inside Out London tonight on BBC 1at 7.30pm. 3000 skeletons are to be excavated from a famous burial site in East London next month as part of the Crossrail project. Among those buried at the old Bedlam site near Liverpool street is the Lord Mayor of London from 1575. Now the Weather with Kate Kinsella. Good afternoon. We started the day with quite a lot of cloud and as it has progressed it has disappeared to a certain extent. We have some nice sunshine this afternoon and it feels less cold certainly than it did last week. These sunny spells continue, the wind is light and underneath the sun it’s going to feel pleasant with a maximum temperature of up to around eight Celsius. If you are stuck under the cloud it will feel a little cooler. We start the night with some clear spells, temperatures dropping down, perhaps not down to zero for the most part but the cloud returns helping out with the temperatures as well. Most places staying above zero, especially towns and cities, between three and five Celsius the minimum. As we head through to dawn the cloud is thick enough to produce the odd spot of light rain and drizzle but it’s not very significant and you will not really notice it. Tomorrow it is a similar day, perhaps more in the way of cloud tomorrow. Still some brightness and sunny spells as we head through the afternoon but the wind remains light and the temperatures similar at seven Celsius. High pressure dominates the weather this week so we are just chasing cloud, the next few days things will stay similar. The only change through Thursday afternoon ",,

Tonight on BBC London: Pushing traffic underground - the plans to transform congested flyovers and major routes into tunnels. And the makeshift distilleries supplying the growing demand in illegal alcohol. pensioner on her doorstep. And we will have all the details of the quarterfinal draw of the Scottish Cup. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The Government insisting it’s cracking down on tax dodgers after leaked documents suggested that HSBC - helped customers evade millions of pounds in tax. The BBC’s Panorama programme has seen details of thousands of accounts from HSBC’s private bank in Switzerland. HSBC says the bank has now ""fundamentally changed."" Labour is demanding to know why only one UK citizen has been prosecuted and the Government’s been criticised for appointing the man who was chairman of HSBC at the time - Lord Green - to the job of trade minister. Our political editor Nick Robinson reports. We expect banks to look after our cash and our savings, but no one expects them to tell you how to escape paying the tax that you owe. Until now, that is. It is clear that HSBC helped thousands of clients cheat tax authorities all over the world, including more than 1000 people here in Britain. David Cameron made the boss of the bank at the time notjust a Trade Minister, but they peer of the realm. Your bankers were helping people dodge tax, why did you let them do that? As I’ve explained I’m not prepared to make any comments on HSBC’s conduct past or present. Claude Green will not say what he knew about the don’t Derrey bank at the time and Mr Stud -- about the don’t Derrey bank at the time and Mr Stud -- and ministers will not say. As he’s no longer the minister is the man who hired him who faces the questions. Stephen Green was an excellent Trade Minister, he did a good job, but I would also add that no government has done more than this one to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. The fact that secretive Swiss bank accounts were used to avoid tax has been known for years. What is new is that HSBC helped their clients to dodge tax. Evidence in the form of thousands of once secret private bank documents analysed by the BBC and the International Consortium of investigative journalists. This tax bombshell has been taking since 2007 when an HSBC whistle-blower stole files from his bank. Three years later the French who had been looking at them sent them on to the British tax authorities. Eight months after that the Prime Minister made Stephen Green Apia and his Trade Minister. Labourare made Stephen Green Apia and his Trade Minister. Labour are demanding to know what checks were made before the man from the bank got his governmentjob -- the man from the bank got his governmentjob -- peer. Any failure by this government to question Stephen Green before his appointment would be an inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of inexcusa ble abdication of responsibility. inexcusable abdication of responsibility. The HSBC files were given to the men from the revenue. Ministers insist there is no evidence that Lord Green was involved in or complicit in tax avoidance. What’s more, they won’t even in office at the time it took place, they argue. The party opposite was in government in 2005-2007. That’s when these allegations relate to. They relate to activity in 2005-2007. The debate here at Westminster has focused all on who knew what and when. But others are asking why more money wasn’t raised from these tax avoidance. just 135 million has been raised so far. And why more of them haven’t ended up in court, if not in prison. So far, we’ve only had one prosecution of somebody in the courts. If you think if this had been benefits scrounging they would have been queueing around the courts to have their cases heard. Once again Britain agonising about what went wrong in a bank, once again there is a row about whether politicians did enough to stop it. With me now is our business editor Kamal Ahmed. There is obviously a focus on what the politicians have or have not done but let’s come back to HSBC itself. It says it has fundamentally changed its practices, has it? There is some evidence it has. This goes back to an awful period before the financial crisis 2007 and before. The bank has said it has totally reformed the private banking arm. It’s a lot smaller and its procedures are very different. Also, there is now a tax deal between the British government and the Swiss government in 2011, which means there is more transparency, supposedly, between the two countries but Derrey over where bank accounts are held so that should help with the clean-up. But as you will see on panorama, Sue Shelley, who was the head of private compliance at HSBC until very recently, says that despite all of the warm words from the top of HSBC, the problems are still within the banks and she is sceptical about whether HSBC has changed. We’ll find out more about this and whether the tax authorities think there has been change when the tax officials are questioned by parliament on Wednesday. Thank you. And you can see more on this story on Panorama: The Bank of Tax Cheats - that’s tonight at 8:30pm here on BBC one. Labour plan to double paternity leave to four weeks if they win the general election. Ed Miliband has also pledged to increase statutory paternity pay to £260 a week, he says it will be paid for by savings in tax credits. Business leaders have opposed the measure, saying there would be costs for employers, potentially affecting jobs and growth. jon Kay has more. Mary and Matt are delighted to announce the arrival of Alfie, born yesterday weighing 6lb. Matt will now have two weeks paternity leave to help with his first child, but he wishes it was longer. I think sometimes dads can be forgotten about. But I think it’s easy to forget that the dads are there too and it’s an important time for them to be with the mother as well as anything, supporting their wife or partner. I think that’s a big part of it. And bonding with the little one. And bonding with the little one in the first few weeks. The Labour Party says new dads like Alfie’s would be able to spend more time at home if they win the general election. Under their plans the amount of paternity leave dads get would double from two weeks to four weeks, and paternity pay would also increase up from £138 a week to £260 a week. As an employerjanice Sinton is worried by the plans. She employs 50 people at her food science firm and she fears it will affect the business if new dads take extra leave. It’s not easy to go out and get temps to fill the gaps, and as a small business we only employ people that we need to do a job. We don’t have spare capacity in the business. It’s difficult enough covering holidays without having to cover extra time as well. Labour insist it would be the Government and not employers who pay for the scheme, which will cost £150 million. But even if paternity pay is increased it will still be less than many dads get as their salary. So for them the question remains: is it worth taking? I know quite a few people who have taken holiday rather than paternity leave which means later in the year they do not have as much time to spend with their new baby. For other countries like Sweden and they have much longer parental leave for dads and I don’t see why we don’t do that in this country. With a general election around the corner expect all the parties to offer policies to attract families like Mary, Matt and Alfie, but for now politics is the last thing on their minds. A teenager has gone on trial accused of planning to murder a British soldier. Brusthom Ziamani was arrested carrying a rucksack containing a 12-inch knife and a hammer, having earlier researched the location of army cadet bases. The 19-year-old has pleaded not guilty to terrorism offences. Our correspondent, june Kelly, is outside the old Bailey. Tell us more about what you heard in court today. It was only in spring in last year that he converted to Islam and a few minutes later he was arrested with a hammer and a knife and allegedly saying he was planning to behead a British soldier at a military base. His idols were said in court to be the two men who murdered Lee Rigby, the young soldier murdered in Woolwich in 2013, and it was said that Ziamani described one of those men, Michael Adebolajo, as a legend. Thejury was told men, Michael Adebolajo, as a legend. The jury was told that he had researched military bases on the Internet including Army Cadet Force Arixtra in south-east London, and in a police interview he said he wanted to go out to the Middle East and fight and die with so-called Islamic State. june, thank you. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. David Cameron has chaired a meeting to discuss how a possible Greek exit from the eurozone would affect the UK. The meeting was attended by representatives from the Bank of England and the Treasury. And inquiry into why a crematorium failed to recover the ashes of babies over more than a decade found that equipment was to blame. Up to 60 parents were not given their children’s remains because they were said to unavailable. At present 14,000 officers are authorised to use the stun gun, which is capable of delivering anorectic shock. People who are repeatedly abusive on social media could be banned from websites such as Twitter and Facebook. Under proposals to reduce rising levels of anti-Semitism, MPs are asking the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether prevention orders like those used to restrict sex offenders’ internet access could be used for people committing hate crimes. Our religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt reports. The impact of online messages can be devastating. One MP has welcomed the possibility of an Internet Asbos same companies aren’t doing enough to stop the abuse. My own personal experience was receiving since October last year thousands of anti-Semitic messages, or to kill early on the Twitter platform but other social media platforms too, and some of them are very threatening in nature, specific death threats I was receiving at the same time as well. Even a Church of England vicar, the Reverend Stephen size has found himself banned from using social media for at least the next six months. Today, the Church of England gave them Derrey him its own version of an online Asbo for posting pieces that were anti-Semitic. And it was the Archbishop of Canterbury who hosted MPs and peers at Lambeth Palace as Beirut Derrey they launched their report on hatred online. I’m deeply concerned. We need free speech and we need to be able to criticise ideas or policies, but that is different from criticising a group or a class of people or a religion, simply because of what they are. In this incredibly hate filled and antagonistic way. The report cites unprecedented levels of fear and exciting amongstjewish unprecedented levels of fear and exciting amongst jewish communities last summer during the conflict in Gaza and also says there are serious concerns over Twitter and its hosting of anti-Semitic abuse. The jewish community is not alone in being the target of online abuse. But many say expressions of religious or racial hatred online must be given zero tolerance, sentiments in the virtual world risk turning into violence in the real one. Welsh rugby came under more pressure today - over how it treats players when they suffer concussion. George North was allowed to play on during the England-Wales match on Friday despite appearing concussed. Today the England coach Stuart Lancaster said the whole sport had ""some way to go"" in dealing with the problem - as Andy Swiss reports. It was the moment the safety of a sport came under the spotlight when George North’s head met an English boot, the dizzying consequences seemed clear. But after a ten minute medical break he was deemed fit to continue, only for a second blow to the head caused him to slump to the ground, yet that wasn’t spotted and again he carried on, prompting some serious questions. Players are going back on with damaged brains. Doctor Barry O’Driscoll used to be world rugby’s medical adviser and told me any player with concussion should be immediately replaced. We’ve got to stop players getting too many knocks and when they get the knock, which produces any kind of sign of it, we must bring them off, we don’t know how much damage it is doing, long term it might do a lot. And the results can be devastating. Benn Robinson wasjust 14 when results can be devastating. Benn Robinson was just 14 when he died after being concussed when playing with his school, and his father is shocked at what happened in Cardiff. It isjust shocked at what happened in Cardiff. It is just bend’s incident repeated. He was checked, allowed back on, another injury and allow to carry on. It’s something you don’t expect at this elite level. From the internationals to the grassroots, it is a risk rugby has to tackle. At schools like this the rules are now very clear. Any child that suffers concussion can’t play rugby for three weeks, but is this an issue that sport as a whole is taking seriously enough? There was criticism at last summer’s football World Cup after Uruguay’s Alvaro Pereira was knocked out but still played on. In American football thousands of players have claimed compensation because of damage caused by concussion. Some leave rugby is at least heading in the right direction. Clearly there is some way to go and lessons to be learned but I’m confident everyone has the right interests of the player at heart. But in rugby the players and pressures have never been bigger. The dangers of concussion inevitable, this, though, mightjust be a wake-up call. Our top story this evening. The government and inland revenue are under pressure tonight. Questions over why HSBC was allowed to help wealthy UK Later later on BBC London, this woman accused of murder Are you watching this programme on a Samsung Smart TV? If so, you might want to watch what you say. Samsung is warning customers who control their TVs using voice activation that the televisions effectively listen to every conversation held in front of them - and may share any details they hear with Samsung or third parties. Rory Cellan-jones reports. Do you have any recommendations? Peteris Do you have any recommendations? Peter is getting used to talking to his television.

If you’re spoken words include personal or other sensitive information that will be amongst the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of voice recognition.

President Obama says he is considering arming Ukranian government forces in their fight against pro-Russian rebels if diplomacy fails. He was speaking at a joint press conference with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel. Mrs Merkel was updating the President on the latest Franco-German plan to bring a halt to the fighting. Our North America editorjon Sopel is at the White House. Is there any sense that were edging closer to a piece deal. Well what we heard today was there as strong transatlantic unity between Europe and the United States over what to do about Ukraine. Full statement of support for diplomatic solution to the conflict and restatement again that there can be no redrawing of international boundaries at the expense of force in the 21st century. But Angela Merkel as you said that there is no military solution to the conflict, Barack Obama held up the possibility if this current round of talks fails, then the US could supply lethal force to Kiev. The one area where there is 100% unity is on the policy of retaining sanctions against Russia. Which of course is the one policy that so far has yielded no results. Who should govern the UK’s cities? Those in charge of some of the biggest councils think they have the answer. They say they should govern themselves - with many more powers such as taxes and public spending devolved from Westminster, Holyrood and Cardiff Bay. Council leaders from Bristol to Birmingham, Liverpool to Leeds have been meeting in Glasgow today - and they’ve been speaking to our Home Editor, Mark Easton. British cities want to take control. Bidders from urban councils across the UK gathered in Glasgow today to demand Westminster gives them similar powers to those devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Calling themselves the core cities they have become an influential lobby for constitutional change and the government in the form of Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, encourage them to go for it. More control over taxation, Alexander, encourage them to go for it. More control overtaxation, more policies devolved, greater accountability at local level. My advice accountability at local level. My advice would be to be ambitious and come and make your case. There is now a more receptive audience in the Treasury. The policies of later devolution to power to Scotland have led to loud calls for similar devolution to other parts of written. Some are suggesting that the city region movement may one day be seen as having given birth to a new constitutional settlement for the whole of the UK. Across Britain local authorities are looking at forming regional assemblies, often around big cities. These city regions can bid for extra powers from Whitehall. Already two such regions around Manchester and Sheffield have been promised city region status. The Treasury has agreed to give ten councils across Greater Manchester control over transport, infrastructure, Greater Manchester control over transport, infrastructure, housing, planning and jobs and the area is hungry for more. It will become a powerful city region from 2017 with an elected mayor. We recognise that people do not want more politicians and tiers of government but they do want efficient public services and decisions taken locally. But here in Wigan on the edge of what will become the Greater Manchester city region, is nostalgia for an older identity. We are quite happy for the benefits of it but I think in our hearts we are Lancashire. I love going to Manchester but Greater Manchester, I do not feel I’m part of it. You could not write a song about Greater Manchester. Breast Lancashire, we have heard some songs tonight. Century imposed constitutional reform struggles to win hearts but supporters of city regions say that their vision is all about local power in the hands of local people. The singer songwriter Sam Smith has credited the heartbreak of unrequited love for his success at The Grammys. The 22-year-old won four awards, including the prestigious prizes for Record and Song of the Year and Best New Artist. As David Sillito reports - it’s cemented his place as one of pop’s biggest starsjust nine months after the release of his debut album. When you saw him at the Grammys, stepping out, what were your feelings. I shed a few tears. I was just very proud. Four Grammy awards, a star and both sides of the Atlantic, this was an evening that meant a great deal. Before I made this record I was doing everything to try to get my music heard. I tried to lose weight and I was making awful music and it was only when I started to be myself that the music began to flow and people started to listen. So thank you for accepting me for being just me. # Won’t you stay with me? # Cos you’re all I need... # And here 6000 miles away it was also a special moment for this singer who first met and talked Sam Smith when he was just first met and talked Sam Smith when he wasjust nine he was just nine years old. When did you think that this is notjust another child singing. Straightaway. The minute he opened his mouth. But to say I would imagine this happening is another thing. to say I would imagine this happening is anotherthing. But happening is another thing. But I knew that it was extraordinary. It isjust that knew that it was extraordinary. It is just that whole thing of having that beautiful tonal quality to the voice. People like Karen Carpenter had it. Ella Fitzgerald. That thing thatjust Carpenter had it. Ella Fitzgerald. That thing that just melts That thing thatjust melts people. Nine years sitting side-by-side teaching, performing, and writing. This is his first-ever, written aged just 17. And now a little gift to joanna. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Alex Deakin. There is very little rain and little snow in the forecast. But the problem comes with the cloud which makes a big difference. If you keep that cloud by Dave Bennett stays cold. Of course it does take the temperatures up by night. -- cold. Of course it does take the temperatures up by night. -- then it stays cold. But by day if you get the sunshine, like today it feels just a little bit like spring. It was a great day across much of the East of England. But stuck onto the cloud, north west England, Northern Ireland and Scott and, it was another chilly day. The cloud is not moving far tonight because the wind is light. We could see some fog patches and also we get that frost with temperatures in rural areas down to around -2. It is a dry day for most on Tuesday. The mist and fog should clear steadily. A cold start for some and eventually some sunshine coming through. Again north-east England, eastern Scotland and some breaks in the cloud further south as well. Fast forward Wednesday and it is a similar story. We begin with patchy frost. A bit more cloud around on Wednesday. And the north-eastern corner of the UK most likely to see some blue skies and those double-figure temperatures. Elsewhere in chilly. So little changed this week, perhaps some rain on Friday but it is dry for most. Night-time fog and frost possible. On the programme tomorrow, United Nations says the conflict in Syria has created the worst humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. I have been talking to present Bashar al-Assad. How much responsibility does he believe that he bears for what has happened? happened? On tonight’s BBC London. Pushing traffic underground - the plans to transform our congested flyovers and busiest roads into tunnels. The message from the mayor’s office is, We will be able to put a park in. But there is concern about the cost of building the tunnels if they materialise at all. Also tonight. The makeshift distilleries brewing illegal alcohol to meet a growing demand. Experts warn it could be deadly. If you drink too much of it in a very short space of time you may not wake up at all.

A night out, which will challenge your ear, eyes and taste buds all at the same time. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. Some of our busiest roads could be going underground to allow traffic to flow more freely while allowing the land above to be developed. The idea to replace wide stretches of roads and flyovers with tunnels has been put forward by Mayor Boris johnson during his visit to America. His trip to Boston, where a similar idea is already in place, has convinced him that a similar scheme will be good for London on roads like the Hammersmith flyover. In a moment, we’ll speak to our reporter Victoria Hollins about having a tunnel there. But first, here’s our Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer. He’s travelling with the Mayor, in the US. They are clearing the roads of snow in Boston as the city faces one of its worst winters in living memory. Please remove all vehicles... Nearly 25 years ago, removing vehicles here wasn’tjust to do with the snow. The city hatched an ambitious plan to put its flyovers underground. Ten years ago I could have sheltered from the snow under a six-lane motorway which went through the centre of Boston. But in 2007, that all changed, something called the Big Dig took place. It took the motorway from up there, down beneath my feet into a five-lane, each way tunnel through the heart of the city. But it was described by one critic as America’s biggest highway robbery because it was well over time and well over budget. Nine years late in fact and 20 billion over budget. Working here and living here in Boston, we called it the big mess because it was so inconvenient for all of us as far as getting around in the dirt and the noise. It was supposed to take three years and cost I think $3 billion. And it went on for like 13 years, infinity and beyond. I didn’t think I would live to see the end of it. But it’s done and it’s wonderful. It’s opened up the city. The message from the Mayor’s office is, it’s time to get the hell out of Dodge. It is that last sentiment that brought the mayor here. In summer, this snowy scene is a public garden, the traffic now hidden. Is this the best example to try and follow? Nine years late, £20 billion over budget. Yes. It is a very good example of what you can do. Yes, I agree there are particular issues which I am sure you should raise with people here about what went wrong. There is no question things go wrong, it did go over budget and it did take too long. But, look at it in the end. They love it here now. You haven’t got people gambling and frolicking here now for the very reason it’s minus 7 degrees and we’ve got to fight through the snow. But in other circumstances, it is a heavily, idyllic park in the middle of what was a gigantic flyover. The mayor wants Transport for London to look at five sites across the capital where this sort of scheme could be used. Including here at the Hammersmith flyover. By the 2020s, he would like to see them all looking like this, but he would expect drivers and local businesses to pay through tolls and rates. These are the tunnels of the Big Dig under Boston, but the driver who took us to meet up with the mayor was less convinced it had been worth it and had some words of caution for London. When there’s money around... OK, this is what we used to say, when the gangsters were around they used to think your money was theirs. Now the government, are the gangsters, they think your money is there is. they think your money is theirs. That’s the theory. Well, Victoria Hollins is by the Hammersmith flyover for us this evening.

Now the government, are the gangsters, they think your money is there is. they think your money is theirs. That’s the theory. Well, Victoria Hollins is by the Hammersmith flyover for us this evening. One of the places earmarked for a tunnel. Yes, anyone who has used the road above me, yay for and any other major routes into and out of London recently, may worry about what the future holds. 21+ millionjourneys every day by people and freight in London. Those numbers are only going to go up. The solution, more tunnels under the capital? More areas of what he calls decking, paving over major routes. This is one spot one of those schemes could come into force in Hammersmith. It has been beset by problems, £70 million is Dean spent on the Hammersmith flyover to keep it going. But under the Hammersmith flyover to keep it going. But underthe new going. But under the new plans, this could be avoided and the new stretch of road could be put under ground, something the local council said it has already considered. We would be able to put a lot of affordable homes, put a park in pedestrian facilities in. Transport for London has looked at 17 sites and has now narrowed it down to five sites. As well as the tunnel at Hammersmith, they could be a mini tunnel at the a 13 in Barking riverside. Intel worth, there could be decking and tunnels at Chalker’s corner and part of the North circular at new Southgate. They wouldn’t be the first underpasses in London, that was in 1962 at Hyde Park corner to ease conjecturing. -- was in 1962 at Hyde Park corner to ease conjecturing. -- congestion. But the question is, who with fake? City Hall thinks it could come from tolls and tax charges. Businesses will always say, we already taxed heavily. It is a good argument for fiscal devolution. The person down -- directly elected by the people of London can make decisions on how the money is spent. There is a warning about spiralling costs and disruption, but it does not seem to have pots of people in Hammersmith. As long as it starts far enough along that road. We would have access to the river and it would acquire it. It would be good that the environment and the city. It is not a bad idea. Would you be repaired to pay £2 each time you use the tunnel? Absolutely not, we pay enough for the roads already. Barking and Dagenham have already welcomed the plans cautiously but London could adopt the American idea, if not the way they went about it. The mayor says he would like to see this plan under way in the space of ten years. He would like to see this plan under way in the space of ten years. He’s confident we would not repeat the mistakes in America. He said we delivered the Olympics on time and in budget. But sceptics will point that this is a lovely thing to say and suggest in the run-up to a general election, but it hasn’t been costed and there is a long way to go before we would see any spades in the ground. Please don’t go away, as there’s lots more to come on the programme - including. Paying to protest - concerns that demonstrators are going to have to fund any disruption they may cause. BBC London has infiltrated a gang which supplies the growing black market in making and selling illegal alcohol. We found some batches being sold among illegal immigrants and the homeless - to contain up to 90% pure alcohol- which experts warn could be fatal. Viewers may find some images in Marc Ashdown’s report disturbing. This alleyway in north London leads to a modern-day slum. Rows of unheated, unsanitary sheds that dozens of illegal immigrants and rough sleepers call home. Harry, drinks as a way of blocking everything out. Harry can’t afford even the lowest priced spirits from the shops, so he buys from an illegal supply of alcohol to feed his addiction. Hidden behind some sheds with beds in a London suburb is a makeshift distillery. By the time it’s coming onto the other end, it’s going to be transformed in liquid which is pure alcohol. What is the strongest one you’ve made? A barrel like this can produce up to six litres of vodka and with the bottles selling for as little as £3, it it’s clear why these drinks are in high demand. What exactly do they contain? The samples of 1+0% proof whiskey we obtained from the illegal distillery are being tested. This sample, tell us what you found? It wasn’t a sample I would drink, to be frank. It is a very pungent sample. If people are buying this then they don’t know exactly what they are letting themselves in for. You worried this is out there, people are drinking this in London? If you were to drink this quite routinely and obviously it can vary from batch to batch, that’s going to give significant health effects. You can suffer from liver diseases, kidney problems and if you drink too much in a very short space of time, you may not wake up at all. Harry is a witness to the health problems are regulated, the health problems unregulated, cheap, strong alcohol can cause. What is normally a minor skin disease has become life-threatening. Once more, he is planning to distil his own alcohol to sell to others like him. Hundreds, thousands, there are no statistics for the number of people drinking these dangerous concoction is, but there are fears of an epidemic of alcoholism in this hidden world. You can see more on that story and the trade in illegal alcohol on Inside Out London. That’s tonight on BBC One at 7.30. And see how our team tracked down the problem to Romania. A mother accused of murdering her eight-year-old daughter with her alleged lover today wept in court as she denied being present when the older woman was punishing the little girl on the day she died. Polly Chowdhury and Kiki Muddar are both charged with killing Ayesha Ali, who was found dead in her bedroom in Chadwell Heath. jo Black is following the case at the Old Bailey. We have already heard the prosecution outlined the relationship between these two women as unconventional and complex. They met as neighbours and Kiki Muddar, the court heard, created more than a dozen fictional characters that sent Polly Chowdhury thousands of text messages suggesting ways in which he could behave. The court has heard that Kiki Muddar told Polly Chowdhury she had cancer and pneumonia. This is the first time Polly Chowdhury was in the witness box. It is the first time we heard from her today when she was giving evidence. She told the court she believed in Angels, spirits and black magic, from a very young age. We heard in court how the couple disciplined Ayesha Ali with a wooden spoon. They gave her chores to do and took some of her meals away from her. When they talked about the night Ayesha Ali died, Polly Chowdhury said she went upstairs and caught Kiki Muddar with herfoot on the child’s chest. A few minutes later she heard Kiki Muddar shout outs, she is drowning. The barrister said to her, what do you think had happened? I thought she had tried to drown herself, she said. After we heard how Kiki Muddar did CPR, how did she appear to you? She did not seem to be herself, she was cold and stiff and her eyes were not focusing properly and her teeth were going up and down. What were you doing? I was crying and I was calling out for sky man to help me. Sky man is a fictional character. What we’re doing? I was on the laptop, she said. Did you do it? Know I did not she replied. Both defendants deny murder and causing the death of a child. The third cyclist to be killed in London this year, has been named as Frederica Baldassa. The 26-year-old from Stepney was hit by a truck on Bloomsbury Square on Friday evening. She died at the scene. Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit are continuing their enquiries. The democratic right to hold a peaceful protest is under the spotlight after Scotland Yard said some of the bill to oversee certain demonstrations needs to be paid for by the organisers. The change in policy has provoked strong criticism, with one group saying it’s being forced to ""pay to protest"". And tonight, the Met Police have said the managing of traffic around all events will now no longer be paid for by them. Alex Bushill reports. What price to protest? None, said the groups against climate change. They want to repeat this protest on last year, next month. When organisers approached the police, they were told The Met no longer paper closing roles and deploying traffic marshals. The organisers believe it will cost them £1+000 instead. Citizens in this country would be disturbed at the idea of introducing attacks on protest. It is an incentive for people to do what we have done, go to the police but maybe then organise flash mobs. The Met says traffic management plans are essential but even if they had paid for this in the past, they will not any more. They said it refers to any event, not just protests were roads need to be closed. The Met budget is under pressure. They are working against a cup to their budget of around a quarter and it means everything is UP quarter and it means everything is up for grabs, including the cost of protests. There are those who agree the police should a tightening their purse strings. These events around the country were other event organisers, sporting events, they contribute and gets tapping in place. It is about linking in with the police to make it safe and efficient. Others disagree. Some groups think it is part of a wider trend. Road testing is one of the means by which people can seek to raise issues which are important. The right protest should not be made dependent on individuals paying and individuals of organised protests having to pay more than they can afford. Tonight there are many unanswered questions. Will New Year’s Eve celebrations or Carnival be perfect? What if organisers refused to pay? Will we see more flash mobs as a result? The price may may be more than just financial. Still to come before 7:00pm: The squash champion from Hertfordshire on equal pay for women and defending her British champion ship. The remains of a former Lord Mayor of London, and an astrologer who was stoned to death outside a theatre are just some of the discoveries, expected to be unearthed from under Liverpool Street Station in the next few weeks. The excavation of the Bedlam burial ground, will expose thousands of skeletons so Sonja jessup has been to see what-else COULD lie in store. Servant or shoemaker. Pauper or pick pocket. The bones of thousands of Londoners are being unearthed. The mystery of who they are, finally being unsolved. The burial ground started off as an obvious place for the poor and dispossessed to be buried. But lots of people chose to be buried here because it wasn’t part of the establishment, outside the ecclesiastical authority of the church. The former Adlon burial ground will become a Crossrail cricket hall-- ticket hall but first comes the painstaking operation to remove the skeletons. Volunteers have been trawling through parish church records for clues to who was buried here. The names came alive when you read them. Especially when you saw several dying at once, a family all dying at once during the plague. Records suggest Sir Ambrose Nicolas could also be buried here. Doctorjohn Lamb, astrologer to the first jukebox docking, believed to be stoned to death by an angry mob outside a theatre, accused of rape and black magic. Archaeologists have literally been piecing together the stories behind the skeletons. It says she died of stop of the stomach. What is that? We cannot translate this into a modern ailments, it could revert to all sorts of things. Obviously something unpleasant and not treatment with 17th century medicine. Although it is impossible to identify individual skeletons, the names are being recorded on Crossrail’s website. The stories of how these Londoners lived and how they died. The reigning British crafts Campion is defending her title this week after ending last year with two, mob muddles and a win over an eight time world champion, she is tipped to do very well. As a professional squash player, world number five Alison Waters spends as much time packing her bag on her bed, as she does sleeping in it. I’ve been a professionalfor12 years now so you kind of get used to it and yes, you live in a bag a lot of the time, in and out of hotels. Sometimes you can take it for granted or not realise you are doing a job you love, travelling around the world and I am lucky to be doing it. Alison has played across the globe, competing in up to 11+ tournaments a year. This year have focuses closer to home as she looks to defend her British title at the National Championships in Manchester. To say you are British national champion is special. I have won it four times already so I would like to get my name on it for the fifth time. just last month, she knocked out the eight time world champion Nicole David in the quarterfinals of the New York leg of the tour of champions. Played in and amongst the commuters at Grand Central Station, this year also saw the women paid the same prize money as the men. We play for the same score and replay the same game, so there and play the same game, so there is no reason we shouldn’t get it. We train just as hard. So for us to be finally recognised in that way was special. Alison Waters... Squash still isn’t an Olympic sport, but following its success at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, Alison Waters still has hopes for Tokyo 2020. Squash came across really well to the public. The crowds were sold out from day one. This can only help us for the Olympic bid. A silver and a bronze in Glasgow, but there was one of highlight. I got a little selfie the with the Queen. She came to the village and I snuck a selfie the end, so it was quite a funny moment. Alison starts the defence of her British squash crown on Thursday. Going for a night out in London may include going for something to eat, followed by a trip to the theatre or an art gallery. But just as we complain there isn’t enough time these days, an artist from Hackney has decided to merge all three into one. So ourart has decided to merge all three into one. So our art is correspondence when to London to try it for herself. Meet some brave Londoners, they have paid for an experience where they have little idea what to expect. This is the brainchild of an artist, Sean, they are guided through a performance but then experience food, but not as they know it. There is no restaurant environment, no tables are waiters. The focus is not on the food. Gastronomy is the nominal, but the environment and sound is as important. In this warehouse space in east London, art meets science, meets astronomy. It does not come cheap. There are seven installations and courses served with rare wine. £50 for no fewer wines, £160 the total experience. People might assume it is a pompous art experience. How do you justify the cost? It is an unforgettable experience. Yes you have the equivalent of a Michelin starred meal and equivalent of a bottle of wine. If you want to break it down by the numbers, it adds up. But it is special. This is more than a 3 course meal, it is an art experience. You are almost buying a limited edition ticket to an art memory that will last for ever. What is undoubtedly unique is the taste of the food. I tried some in the blue room. It feels like marshmallow. It smells Savary, but it tastes sweet. It is incredibly. This is suited to thrill seekers and brothers of immersive theatre and strange food. If you want to know what red, blue or orange sounds taste like, it is at Hackney until Monday. Now the weather with Wendy. It was mild to date? Far more trouble free this week. We have high pressure and that means try and calm conditions. Whether we get as much sunshine as we did today, it is the problem we have got as forecasters. It was a little brighter than we thought it was going to be. Temperatures were 10 degrees in many spots around London. This weather front is drifting east and we will see the cloud circulating around it and perhaps for the next few days there won’t be quite as much sunshine but we do have the effects of the high pressure which is settled weather. At the moment we still have clear skies. It does have an effect on the overnight temperatures. We will have some places outside London tonight getting down below freezing. We will see some mist and fog developing around London, which is something you may run into first thing tomorrow morning and may cause disruption at the airport. To, 1+ degrees generally but many places could fall freezing. A mixture of cloud as well and although there will be bright sunny spells breaking through during the day, generally speaking there will be more cloud than sunshine. Temperatures reaching 7 degrees. If we do get any long spells of sunshine, it will feel warmer. Overthe spells of sunshine, it will feel warmer. Over the next few days, we hang on to the high pressure system for Wednesday and Thursday. Edging away towards the east. Bit of a battle ground because the pressure system looks like it will develop out into the Atlantic but will work its way during Friday and it may bring rain. We’ll have two what judge that situation. But the ridge of high pressure be set-- behind it, means it will be settled over the weekend.

Comic Relief has crashed the Bake Off tent. On your marks. Get set. Bake! ..as16 celebrities battle it out for star baker. It’s like a war in here. It does look, um... Disgusting? Yeah! It’s very tense! Yes! Hello. Good evening. And welcome to The One Show with Alex jones. Hello. Good evening. And welcome to The One Show with Alexjones. And Matt Baker. After five series of the Great British Bake Off, we know tonight’s guest is a fan of a Baker which may explain why she’s teamed UP which may explain why she’s teamed up with Matthew for the new BBC One series the Gift. Very good. And with a number one record to her name, she’s added singing as another string to her bow. Please welcome, give us a song lads! Lovely! Please welcome our guests! Amazing. Hi, how you doing? Funky. They are lovely. Extraordinary. I love the way you can see them through the cello. You can see the lovely things. Slightly distracted by them. Can’t believe you didn’t sing on the way in, Mel Giedroyc? That was a speedy version. That was the song you did for Children In Need. Slightly obsessed by it now. Tell us what you are doing on Sunday? I’ve got to present some Theatre Awards which I do every year. They said this year, do you want to do a full song and dance number to want to do a full song and dance numberto open the want to do a full song and dance number to open the show with, I said yes without thinking.

Ifeel so nervous for you. Me too. You should have said no. Never mind, it will be great. You can use the lads over here, because we are going to be hearing more from the two cellos, Luca and Steppan later in the show when they perform a stunning version of AC/DC’s Thunderstruck. It will shock you. What is it like to discover that your child is not only being bullied online but is also guilty of being a bully as well? Fiona Foster found out when The One Show spent the week at a Staffordshire school. Over a school week, pupils at St Marg red Ward Catholic academy revealed their online secrets in our video confession booth. When you post like a photo of yourself, like of your face, When you post like a photo of yourself, like of yourface, it’s like trolling and people are like ""you are so ugly"". We go on and talk to a boy for a week and we’d bully them. I’m really sorry I did that to anyone. They said things like, go kill yourself and you’re ugly and horrible. A survey commissioned by the BBC found more than two thirds of 11-16-year-olds have witnessed or been involved in bullying online, either as victims or bullies. You put things, nasty things. If you are friends with nasty girls, they expect you to like their photos, if you are friends with popular girls. When you’re online, you are a different person. It’s not the nice person you are in real life. Yes. Some of the pupils have agreed to tell me more. A sixth former who says she’s experienced cyber bullying for years is 17-year-old Charlotte who lives near school with her mum. A lot of the messages were calling me fat and stuff like that. So a while after I was very reluctant to just be myself around people I knew. How did you feel about the fact she was so disturbed about the messages she was getting? Ijust wanted to comfort and help her. You are fighting a ghost, you know. There’s nobody physical that you can speak to. It’s anonymous. Another pupil on the receiving end of bullying is 16-year-old gamer kierin. It made me feel lost inside. When it happened, Ijust kind of knew that what he was saying was kind of true about me, but it’s something that I can’t change. But Charlotte and Keiran have also been bullies too. And, as Charlotte found when she posted a spiteful comment online, it soon escalated as others eagerlyjoined the fray. Within the first hour, there was between 100 and 200 comments. How did you feel when you realised you’d started this avalanche of nastiness? I know now thatit avalanche of nastiness? I know now that it was wrong. At the time it was heat of the moment. Online gamer Keiran wasjust chatting was heat of the moment. Online gamer Keiran was just chatting to fellow players when he led the online charge into name-calling aimed at one player. Ifelt disgusted charge into name-calling aimed at one player. I felt disgusted with myself because I knew that what I was doing was just totally unacceptable and that I didn’t want people to feel what I’d felt. Both Charlotte and Keiran agreed we could show their parents their videos. On Facebook I posted a not so nice status about this other girl and it resulted in a massive argument where really harsh names were being thrown at each other, people were threatening to get parents involved, threatening to phone the police, tell teachers.

Leaked documents seen by the BBC reveal the bank was complicit in the tax evasion. The Prime Minister insists the Government is stopping tax dodgers. No Government has done more than this one to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. The Government has offered amnesties for people to come forward and pay up without being prosecuted, but they have not really worked. They have raised far less than they said they would. The Government claims £135 million have been recouped from HSBC customers, Labour’s asking why there’s been only one UK prosecution. Also tonight: In Bath four people are killed - police say a tipper truck lost control as it came down a hill. A teenager from south-east London goes on trial accused of preparing to murder a British soldier. In eastern Ukraine, rebels parade and humiliate captured Army soldiers as intensive diplomacy tries to end the crisis. Do you have any recommendations? In which case, watch what you say - it’s listening. On tonight’s BBC London: Moving our busiest roads underground. Plans to replace flyovers - with fly-unders. And claims that protestors could be silenced after a new policy to charge them. Good evening. The Government and the Inland Revenue are under pressure tonight about how they responded to leaked documents from one of the world’s biggest banks, HSBC, which show how the bank helped UK customers evade millions of pounds in tax. The BBC’s Panorama programme has seen details of thousands of accounts from HSBC’s Private Bank in Switzerland. HSBC says the bank has now ""fundamentally changed."" Labour is demanding to know why only one UK citizen has been prosecuted. And the Government’s been criticised for appointing the man who was chairman of HSBC at the time, Lord Green, to the job of Trade Minister. Our political editor, Nick Robinson, reports. Banks are meant to look after your cash and your savings. No-one expects them to tell you how to break the law to escape the tax you owe, until now, that is. Leaked files have shown how more than 1,000 people from Britain with Swiss bank accounts and thousands more around the world were helped and advised by HSBC on how to hide their money from the tax man. David Cameron made the boss of the bank at the time not just a Trade Minister, but a Peer of the Realm. Your bankers helped people dodge tax. Why? I am not prepared to make any comment. Lord Green will not say what he knew about the bank at the time and ministers will not say what they asked him. How can you defend it? I am not prepared to make my comment. As he’s not longer a minister, it is the man who hired him facing the questions. Stephen Green was an excellent Trade Minister. He did a good job. excellent Trade Minister. He did a goodjob. No good job. No Government has done more than this one to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. The evidence of what happened eight years ago at HSBC comes in the form of a massive trail of once Private Bank documents. Analysed by the BBC and the international consortium of journalists. This tax bombshell has been ticking since 2007, when an HSBC whistle-blower stole files from his bank. Three years later, the French who had been looking at them, sent them on to the British tax authorities. A few months later David Cameron gave Stephen Green a peerage and then Lord Green was appointed Trade Minister. Labour are demanding to know what checks were made before the man from the bank got his Governmentjob. Any failure by this Government to question Stephen Green before his appointment would be an inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of inexcusa ble abdication of responsibility. inexcusable abdication of responsibility. The Tories point out the Revenue asked for the incriminating files when Labour was still in power. What’s more, they argue, is what went wrong dates back even earlier. The party opposite was in Government in 2005-2007. That’s where these allegations, that is when these allegations relate to. They relate to activity in 2005-2007. The debate here at Westminster has focussed on all who knew what and when. But others are asking - why knew what and when. But others are asking- why more money wasn’t raised from these tax avoiders? just £135 million has been raised so far and why more of them have not ended UP and why more of them have not ended up in court, if not in prison. So far, we’ve only had one prosecution of somebody in the courts. If you think if this had been benefit scrounging they would have been queueing around the courts to have their cases heard. Not the ideal night for David Cameron to welcome his richest supporters to a Tory ball. Expected to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for the party. Nick Robinson, BBC News, Westminster. So, could the Inland Revenue have done more to pursue HSBC’s customers who evaded tax, and how much has the bank changed since these documents were leaked? Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, is here. It’s certainly been a day when banking is back in the dock. HSBC is Britain’s biggest bank, raising the question, if there is evidence of tax evasion, a criminal offence, why haven’t there been more prosecutions? Many believe there should have been. What’s striking is that whilst the bank itself is being investigated in countries like the United States, France, Belgium, even Argentina, back in the UK, in its home country, where some of its major tax evaders reside, it is not being investigated at all. Not only have none of the customers been prosecuted, but the bank itself seems to be above the law. HMRC says it is taking a different route because there is more chance of actually getting money back from the taxpayer by taking civil rather than criminal actions. The burden of proof is lower and deals can be done. We asked a former tax investigator, given today’s developments, could prosecutions now follow? The reason they have not prosecuted, so far, is because they have not had the evidence from abroad to be able to substantiate a criminal prosecution in this country in an admissible format. Now that information, since the Swiss agreement has come into effect, is readily available to HMRC, provided they make a request for it through the usual, diplomatic channels. Tonight, after a day of allegations about HSBC’s operations in Geneva, there was a change of tone. HMRC said it will look at any new evidence. The bank regulator and the Financial Conduct Authority also told the BBC that it was watching developments. So, what has HMRC recovered? It has been paid £135 million in back taxes from individuals on the HSBC list. That compares to £188 million collected by France and £220 million collected by Spain. The big question is - has HSBC cleaned up its act? It says, yes. But one former employee was asked by Panorama if they had gone far enough? From what I have seen, no. The verbal messages were great. They think, in my view, they were not put into practise and that disturbed me, greatly. So, I made more and more noise about those issues. The more I did this, the more I clearly became annoying to management. That we are still reporting on banking’s bad behaviour, seven years after the financial crisis, reveals that the problems in British banks went a lot deeper than was initially thought. And the bad news for HSBC and other British banks won’t stop with tax evasion. In the next few months, major fines are expected from America following allegations of foreign exchange manipulation. And the first trials of bankers accused of manipulating interbank interest rates are expected to start in the spring. Expect many more negative headlines. Four people have been killed and several others injured in an accident involving a tipper truck in Bath. It collided with a number of vehicles and two pedestrians as it drove down a hill. jon Kay is at the scene What more can you tell us? Well, news tonight that a child was among those killed here hasjust compounded the sense of loss and grief in this community. The accident happened just down the hill here, outside the school gates, at the end of the day, just as children were heading home with their mums and dads. They have shielded off the scene of the crash. Carnage how the police described it, in a quiet suburb of Bath tonight. A loaded tipper truck, ploughing into pedestrians and vehicles during rush hour, killing four, injuring several others. It isjust hour, killing four, injuring several others. It is just the... others. It isjust the... Daniel Stephens lives next to the scene and ran to help seconds after the crash. The whole atmosphere was just sickening and as soon asl The whole atmosphere was just sickening and as soon as I stepped out, it was like I shouldn’t be here. It wasn’t nice. People around here say the truck was sounding its horn repeatedly as it came down this steep hill, as if it was a warning. Seconds later, it crashed just those emergency vehicles, very close to a school. It was lipm and dozens of primary-aged children were being picked up from after school clubs. Parents said the timing could not have been worse. It is terrible. just absolutely awful. It makes you realise how precious life is, really. You never know, do you? It is shocking. It is devastating. You would not imagine this would happen here and my heart goes out to the families. Tonight, a wide area is cordoned off as officers try to work out why the loaded truck came crashing down the hill. We think it lost control and makes attempts to avert an accident. However it made contact with two ped Estaiians as they went down -- pedestrians as they went down the hill. Most of the people are being treated at the Royal Bath Hospital, which is a few hundred yards from where the crash happened. We’ve had it confirmed there are five people still in hospital tonight. there are five people still in hospitaltonight. One hospital tonight. One has been taken by airambulance to hospital tonight. One has been taken by air ambulance to Southmead Hospital in Bristol, about 15 miles away and is said to be critical. Bath is a city, but it is a small city, lots of tight communities. People know one and other here. They are reeling tonight that this has happened on one of the main routes in and out of the centre. The BBC has learned that David Cameron has chaired a meeting with representatives from the Bank of England and the Treasury to discuss how a possible Greek exit from the Eurozone would affect the UK. The Prime Minister met officials at Number Ten as the stand-off between the new, radical left government in Greece and its international creditors continues. The Police Federation of England and Wales has called for all police officers to be able to use tasers in the light of the increased threat posed by terrorism. It’s estimated that at present 10,000 officers are trained to use the stun gun, which fires electrodes to incapacitate a suspect. A teenager has gone on trial accused of planning to murder a British soldier. Brustchom Ziamani was arrested carrying a rucksack containing a 12-inch knife and a hammer, having earlier researched the location of army cadet bases. The 19-year-old has pleaded not guilty to terrorism offences. Our correspondent, june Kelly, was in court. Brustchom Zia mani only Brustchom Ziamani only converted to Islam last spring. Today he was -- his trial was told that he was allegedly planning to behead a British soldier. He was arrested in London carrying a hammer and a 12 inch knife in his rucksack, as well as a black Islamic flag. This is said to be what he was trying to âÂPYÂ said to be what he was trying to copy, the murder of Lee Rigby in 2013. Ziamani was said to idolise the two murderers. Today the Old Bailey heard that he described one of them as a legend. According to the prosecution Ziamani had spoken of holding up a soldier’s severed head so a friend could take a photograph. The jury was told, 2 On the Internet he had researched army locations in London, evidence the jury was told of his interest in army targets. In her letter, he had written: President Obama has met the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, at the White House to discuss a peace plan for eastern Ukraine. Mrs Merkel insists she sees no military solution but President Obama says he is still considering giving weapons to the Ukrainian army. But as the intense diplomacy continues, there’s no let up in the fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian government forces. Prisoners are being taken by both sides and our correspondent james Reynolds reports now from Donetsk on one woman’s efforts to free her husband. On the 21st january, rebel fighters took Donetsk Airport in one of the toughest battles of the entire war. Here, rebels corralled the defeated government soldiers. The captives include this 37-year-old from Kiev. They are made to march through the streets. The sergeant major, with a bandaged hand, manages a shuffle. His wife, Oxana, has made the journey alone into rebel-held territory to get her husband back. She was even detained herself, but it has not stopped her. She’s tried to explain her mission to the couple’s eight-year-old son, Mark. TRANSLATION: You know, when I left, my son started crying. He said, ""Mum, don’t go."" He’s little, but he’s quite a mature boy. I sat him down and I said to him, honestly, ""Mark, I am going to Donetsk and I am going to get your daddy back."" Prisoners in this conflict do get exchanged. Here at night, one group organises a captive swap. Both the governments and the rebels promise a quick release of the injured. TRANSLATION: We try to return the wounded straight away. There’s no point in them staying here. They may as well go back and get treatment. We’ve been told that some captured soldiers may be held here at a rebel building in Donetsk. The fate of prisoners on either side is one of the most emotional issues in the entire conflict. If there is to be a lasting peace agreement between the Ukrainian government and the rebels here, it will have to include a full prisoner exchange. Oksana continues to wait. Negotiators suggest her husband may be released this week. She will stay here in rebel-held territory until that happens. President Obama and Angela Merkel were meeting today, were they in agreement? They agreed there was strong transatlantic unity and that sanctions are having an effect, although not changing Vladimir Putin’s behaviour yet. Where they diverged, and it is significant, is over the question of sending lethal force to Kiev. Angela Merkel says there is no military solution. President Obama says they will consider it. You can almost imagine Angela Merkel sitting down with Vladimir Putin and saying this is your last chance to sign and abide by a cease-fire, if not I will not be able to stop President Obama giving weaponry to the Ukrainians. Teddy Roosevelt once said, you speak quietly and carry a big stick. In this arrangement it seems Angela Merkel is speaking quietly while in the background Barack Obama holds the big stick. Thank you. A new propaganda video by extremist Islamic State has appeared online featuring the British photojournalist john Cantlie. In it he says it is the ""last film in this series"". He’s been held hostage for two years and has featured in a range of videos made by Islamic State. A former Home Office researcher whose report into the sexual exploitation of children in Rotherham over a decade ago was suppressed has told the BBC she was personally threatened by police officers and bullied by the council. Last year a report found 1,400 children had been sexually exploited in the town by groups of men. just last week a report concluded Rotherham council is no longer fit for purpose. Our Social Affairs correspondent Alison Holt reports. Rotherham is a town in limbo, still shocked by the Casey Report, which detailed a culture of bullying and denial in a council not fit for purpose, one that left the town’s children vulnerable to sexual exploitation for years. For Adele Gladman, it makes difficult reading. There should have been an investigation, I don’t understand why there wasn’t. In 2002, as a Home Office researcher working at the council, she wrote a report detailing the scale of sexual exploitation in the town. Previously, she has only spoken anonymously about the warnings she made. What I didn’t realise was how many whistleblowers there had been over the years and how many opportunities there had been to change poor practice. That has cost, hasn’t it? That has cost young people their health, their happiness, and in some cases their lives. That is unforgiva ble. Her report said a small number of men of Pakistani heritage were exploiting a significant number of girls. She says she was given race awareness training and her report was effectively suppressed. I had every aspect of my professionalism questioned, I had every aspect of my work questioned. I had data removed over a weekend so that I couldn’t substantiate my findings. Fortunately I had made copies. But she says the bullying she faced went beyond the council. She remembers a police officer approaching her outside her office. He and a colleague said words along the lines of, ""wouldn’t it be a shame if these perpetrators found out where you and your family lived?"" And I took that as a direct threat to my personal safety, the message was very clear. South Yorkshire Police say they cannot comment on that specific claim but they are committed to supporting the victims of sexual exploitation and that prosecuting offenders is a top priority. As for Rotherham Council, it is waiting to hear who the Government will put in to run the authority. But many remain angry about the time that has been wasted since last year’s jay Report first said that more than 1,400 children had been sexually exploited in the town. During this period of inertia, a further period of inertia and putting energy into defending the reputation of the council, more children - yet more children have been harmed. Maybe with a fresh start, a fresh approach, we can start to put things right in Rotherham. The hope is this time children really will be better protected. Alison Holt, BBC News. Police investigating the assault and robbery of a disabled pensioner outside his home in Gateshead have charged a man. Alan Barnes, who is visually impaired, suffered a broken collarbone in the attack. After he said he was too frightened to return home, a local beautician set up a website to raise money for him to move elsewhere. The site exceeded expectations, raising over £300,000 after his plight became national news. Who should govern the UK’s cities? Those in charge of some of the biggest councils think they have the answer. They say they should govern themselves, with many more powers such as taxes and public spending devolved from Westminster, Holyrood and Cardiff Bay. Council leaders from Bristol to Birmingham, Liverpool to Leeds, have been meeting in Glasgow today, and they’ve been speaking to our Home Editor, Mark Easton. There are stroking images in this report. -- strobing. Britain’s cities want to take control. Leaders from urban councils across the UK gathered in Glasgow today to demand Westminster gives them similar powers to those devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Calling themselves the Core Cities, they have become an influential lobby for constitutional change and the Government, in the form of Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, encouraged them to go for it. More control over taxation, more policies devolved, greater accountability at a local level. My advice would be to be ambitious and come and make your case. There is now a more receptive audience in the Treasury now than there has every been historically. The promises of far greater devolution of power here to Scotland have led to increasingly loud calls for similar devolution to other parts of Britain. Some are suggesting that the city region movement may one day be seen as having given birth to a new constitutional settlement for the whole of the UK. Across Britain, local authorities are looking at forming regional assemblies, often around big cities. These city regions can bid for extra powers from Whitehall. Already two such regions around Manchester and Sheffield have been promised city region status. The Treasury has agreed to give ten councils across Greater Manchester control over transport, infrastructure, housing, planning and jobs, and the area is hungry for more. In 2017 it will become a powerful city region with an elected mayor. We recognise that people do not want more politicians and tiers of government, but they do want efficient and effective local services and decisions taken locally. But here in Wigan, on the edge of what will become the Greater Manchester City Region, there is nostalgia for an older identity. We are quite happy for the benefits of it but I think in our hearts we are Lancashire. For me, anyway. I love going to Manchester and that, but Greater Manchester, Ido not feel I’m part of it. You could not write a song about Greater Manchester. Whereas with Lancashire, we have heard some songs tonight. Centrally-imposed constitutional reform struggles to win hearts but supporters of city regions say that their vision is all about local power in the hands of local people. Mark Easton, BBC News. Are you watching this programme on a Samsung Smart TV? If so, you might want to watch what you say. Samsung is warning customers who control their TVs using voice activation that the televisions can effectively listen to conversations held in front of them, and may share any details they hear with a third party. Rory Cellan-jones reports. Do you have any recommendations? Peter Kent is getting used to talking to his television. Change channel to 105. The Samsung Smart TV responds to various voice commands. But until today, he hadn’t read the privacy policy. ""Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your voice recognition."" How does that make you feel? I feel a bit annoyed it wasn’t made clear to me in advance of buying the TV or when I set up the TV. Did you not actually read the privacy policy? That’s the thing, it is hidden away. No one ever read the terms and conditions so no, I completely missed it. Samsung explained that the third party that gets access to some data is an American voice recognition firm that listens to and interprets some of the spoken commands, but the company insisted ‘Samsung does not retain voice data or sell it to third parties’. Samsung is stressing that users have complete control over when their TV is listening to them, it only happens when that microphone symbol is on the screen. What all of this highlights is that more and more of our devices around the home are being connected to the internet and could be sharing our information with the world. This smart thermostat for instance knows when you are away from home, and other gadgets also come with privacy concerns. It is about educating yourself, making sure you know what you are buying and what data it is likely to be collecting. As you set it up, there may be a box to tick saying I don’t want it to collect my data or send it to a third party. With some devices that may not always be possible.

Why the Mayor is braving the snows in America to capitalise on the London Games. Plus, Kate will be here with a full weather forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, has told the BBC that he bears no responsibility for the humanitarian crisis engulfing parts of his country, after four years of fighting against insurgents and Islamic extremists. President Assad has denied that Syrian forces have shelled schools, or used chemical weapons, or barrel bombs, to kill civilians. And he insisted he was doing his duty to protect his country from terrorists. Since the conflict began, 220,000 Syrians have been killed in fighting between President Assad’s forces and different anti-government groups. The conflict has destroyed entire neighbourhoods - forcing nine million people from their homes. UNICEF estimates there are over six million children in urgent need of help. While more than 3.5 million refugees have crossed borders into neighbouring countries. Capitalising on the chaos, Islamic State has taken control of huge swathes of Syria, making a base for itself in the northern city of Raqqa. Since September, a US-led coalition has launched air strikes inside Iraq and Syria in an effort to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS, according to President Obama. Our Middle East Editor, jeremy Bowen, is in Beirut. Yes, President Assad mounted a very vigorous defence of his men, of what he’s been doing with a very consistent line coming out of what he said, that he is fighting terrorism, that he tries to protect civilians. His interpretation is, of course, a million miles away from those who say that the Syrian regime has been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of its own people. It was the first chance that we and the BBC had had to speak to President Assad since before the war. I did an interview with him in 2010, before the fighting started. So, of course, when we got together, I had a lot of questions to ask him. Mr President, you’ve lost control of large areas of Syria, the jihadist group that calls itself Islamic State has emerged, there are perhaps 200,000 Syrians dead, millions have lost their homes, the UN Envoy has called this the most serious humanitarian crisis in the world since the Second World War. Has Syria become a failed state? No, as long as the government and the state institutions fulfilling its duty towards the Syrian people, we cannot talk about failed states. Talking about losing control is something completely different. It is like if you have invasion of terrorists coming from abroad and the government is doing itsjob in fighting and defending its country. I have spent time on the front-line with soldiers from the Syrian Army who insisted that they were patriotic, that they were patriots, they weren’t cold-blooded killers, but I have also interviewed people and so have many otherjournalists and human rights people and so on, who say they have suffered badly at the hands of Syrian soldiers. They can’t all have been lying, surely? How? How surely? Why are you sure? Because the weight of testimony - Human Rights Watch, 30thjanuary this year, has said that forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad ""have deliberately and viciously attacked civilians in opposition-held areas using indiscriminate weapons notoriously barrel bombs."" This is a childish story that keeps repeating in the West. Childish? Why? Again, if somebody who is against his people and again the regional power and the great powers in the West and survive how... What about barrel bombs, you don’t deny your forces are using them? I know about the Army, they use bullets, missiles and bombs, I haven’t heard of Army using barrels or... Large barrels full of explosives and projectiles which are dropped from helicopters and explode with devastating effect? There’s been a lot of testimony about these things? They are called bombs. We have bombs, missiles and bullets. You wouldn’t deny that included under the category of ""bombs"" are these barrel bombs, which are indiscriminate weapons? No, there’s no indiscriminate weapons, when you shoot, you aim, when you shoot- when you aim, you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians. Again, if you’re talking about casualty, that’s war, you cannot have war without casualty. On the fight against Islamic State and Al-Qaeda, the US and others have said you cannot be a partner in that fight. Would you like to be a partner? Would you like tojoin... Partner with who? Partner with the countries that are attacking Islamic State at the moment? Do you mean the Alliance? The jordanians? Definitely, we cannot and we don’t have the will and we can’t for one simple reason, we cannot be alliance with a country who support the terrorism. Do you talk to the Americans? There are American planes in the air above Syria the whole time. Do you coordinate? No. They don’t talk to anyone. They don’t talk to us, we don’t talk to them. I’m curious that at a time when there are, there’s the American military in the air above Syria and your people are in the air, your air force is, the Syrian Air Force is in the air above Syria, that there haven’t been any incidents between the two. No shots seem to have been traded, no planes have been shot down. That suggests to me surely that there is someone is talking to someone here? That’s correct. Again, there is no direct operation. Direct, is it via Iraq, that is what some people have said? That is through third party, more than one party. Other countries. Sometimes they convey message, general message, but there is nothing tactical. They don’t tell you when we will be bombing at 10.00 this evening, keep out of the way? We knew about the campaign before it started, but we didn’t know about the details. Is that a continuing dialogue that you have through third parties? There’s no dialogue. There’s, let’s say, information. But not dialogue. They tell you things? Something like that. Do you tell them things? No. And apart from Iraq? When we do something in our territory, or on our territory, we don’t ask anyone, we don’t tell anyone. Can we talk about the humanitarian situation a little bit? One of the effective military tactics, the Syrian Army has used, is to isolate areas held by rebels, effectively to starve them out. That has had the effect of starving civilians. And that again is against the laws of war, starving civilians? That’s not correct for one reason. In areas where the rebels take over, the civilians fled and COTTIE to oUI’ BFEGS. Very simply. So the area we encircle and attack are only filled with militants. They may have come to your areas, not because they want to come, but because their areas are being heavily bombed. I have been in some of the suburbs of Damascus, which are a huge contrast to here in the centre where there is rubble 20 metres high. No. That’s not realistic. FOI’ ODE I’â3SOIâ1. The natural reaction of any person of the people of the families, of the population, is to flee from any area where they expect a conflict. That is why they fled that area. They expect fighting between the Army and the militants. They fled that area. And they come to the government. What keeps you awake at night? What keeps me awake at night? Many reasons that could effect any human. Life. Could be personal. Could be work. Yourjob? Could be yourjob, could be personal, like any other human. What could any human be affected by, affected with the same factors? You have tried for a very long time to get this interview. Why has he agreed to give it to you now? Yes, I first asked when the war started and I have been talking to them in a serious way since the autumn. And then they said, ""We will do it when the time is right."" For them, they believe the time is OK because they are feeling more secure. The Americans, by bombing Islamic State, are helping them out, indirectly, or directly. The Syrian Army retains a lot of cohesion and is fighting effectively. I think that the overall diplomatic set-up from the eyes, from the view of the Damascus Presidential Palace is looking a little bit more favourable because for some people, Assad is being seen as not the worst guy involved in all of this. He might even be part of the solution. It is fascinating seeing him there in the Presidential Palace, where you interviewed him. So many Syrians who are suffering at the moment - So many Syrians who are suffering at the moment- how is the Assad family living? What is it like for them at the moment? Well, the interview took place in a guesthouse of the Presidential Palace. They don’t live there. They live somewhere else in the city. By all accounts, they live by the standards of Middle Eastern folk a relatively frugal life, that is what they say. I think the thing about Assad is, and the Assads in general, is Syria is effectively a family business. When he gets together to talk about the conduct of the war, he talks to his brother, he talks to his cousins, he talks to people who are very close to the family, people come from the same coastal region that they do, so I think that, in a sense, it is private business. He is like the chairman of a family company. So, I think that he is somebody who is in his own world. That is why he is sticking to a lot of what he says the whole time, very adamant in his defence of what they are doing. jeremy Bowen, thank you very much. You can see a full-length interview tonight at 8.30pm on the BBC News Channel. David Cameron has told business leaders that it’s time to give their staff a pay rise. Speaking in the past hour to the British Chambers of Commerce, he said the benefits of falling costs should be shared with the workforce. But their message to the Prime Minister, was to call for an EU referendum as soon as possible, to end the uncertainty over Britain’s place in Europe. Here’s our Political Correspondent, Iain Watson. Ona more On a more positive note, the good news is, I have been promoted... This fictional boss often put his interests ahead of his workforce. You are not going to lose yourjob, you are not going to lose your job... With the economy doing better, another David is warning business leaders to be more sympathetic and to put extra cash into the pockets of the staff. Now that costs are falling, and it is cheaper to do business, I’m confident that more and more businesses will pass on that good economic news to their workers in rising pay cheques and higher earnings, that is good news for your employees, it is good for you... Trade unions, whose members have demonstrated against public sector PHY demonstrated against public sector pay caps and wage freezes, say the Prime Minister should practice what he preaches. He should turn rhetoric into reality and lift that public sector pay cap. Millions of public sector workers have seen their incomes fall in real terms. Rather than lecturing business leaders, he should take practical action. His message here is focussed on the economy. Some of the businesses have come to this conference, they are far more worried about another issue - Britain’s relationship with Europe. David Cameron has said if he is still Prime Minister, he would hold an EU referendum by the end of 2017. In a run-up to the referendum, we need to make that period as short as possible to reduce the uncertainty. If Labour were to win the next election, that uncertainty would not be any less because they would be under huge pressure to have a referendum. But, the Shadow Chancellor all but ruled out a referendum under a Labour Government. I fear that every comment by senior Cabinet Ministers saying they would be happy or relaxed for us to walk out of Europe, and every hint that a referendum could happen as early as next year before any meaningful reform could be achieved only adds to the uncertainty and the risk for British business. So, it was Ed Balls who delivered Labour’s message to business. The other Ed had a prior engagement. Iain Watson, BBC News, Westminster. Our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith, is in Westminster. How is this all playing out for Labour today? Well, it is another bumpy day for Labour in terms of its relations with business because whereas up to now they have been able to comfort themselves that business backs them over Europe, namely being opposed to leaving the EU and being wary about a referendum, today we had the boss of this business organisation, which represents five million people, saying we would rather like a referendum and we would like one sooner rather than later and we don’t believe a Labour Government would be able to hold out against granting a referendum if they were in power. All this on the day when there’s been a good deal of private muttering about Ed Miliband’s no show when the world and his wife politically have turned up. We have had David Cameron, Nick Clegg to come, Vince Cable, George Osborne, now Mr Miliband’s people say we have sent Ed Balls instead. This was all planned months in advance. The difficulty is, it fuels a perception that somehow Mr Miliband isn’t that interested in business and some times when you are having a bit of ative with -- times when you are having a bit of ative with -- a tiff with neighbours, it is good to talk. Police have named a four-year-old girl who was killed by a tipper truck in Bath yesterday while working with her grandmother. Three men in a car also died when a truck ran out of control, five other people are being treated in hospital including the full girls grandmother in a critical condition. jon Kay is in Bath. It’s a sign of how much damage was done here that almost 21+ hours after the truck came crashing down this hill, they are still clearing the debris. And the road is still closed. Official confirmation in the last few minutes of what many people knew, the identity of the little girl who died. Loved and missed by all. The message this lunch time from the family of the little girl killed last night by a tipper truck. little girl killed last night by a tippertruck. First tipper truck. First thing this morning, the lobby which struck her was removed from the crash scene. -- the lorry. Police believe the 32 tonne truck was out of control when it came crashing down a steep hill hitting pedestrians and vehicles. We are remembering them in our prey is... just down the hill they came to remembertheiryoung is... just down the hill they came to remember their young friend. It is understood the four-year-old was crossing the road with her grandmother when she was killed, many in the congregation know the family. We are a community. Each and every one of us. We will all help. We are all devastated. Especially the child. It does not seem real, it’s a nightmare. I was looking out of the window because you could see the blue lights flashing and people moving about. I think it will affect the school really badly with the little ones. It isjust to comfort and console each other when something awful happened is right on your doorstep like that, it’s about supporting and holding each other up. Carrying through the terrible time. The lorry crashed right outside a primary school, just as pupils were heading home from lessons. The grandmother of the girl was critically injured, and three men from south Wales were also killed when their car was hit. They were aged 31+, 52, and 59. Witnesses say that the lorry driver sounded his horn repeatedly as he came down the hill before crashing and spilling tonnes of aggregate. The police believe he was trying to warn people of the danger. Trying to avert an accident. The driver was spoken to for a few questions but he’s still in hospital, when he’s fit I am sure there will be further questions. Friends have been signing messages of remembrance for the little girl and the other victims, some of them witnessed the crash and will be offered specialist counselling as they come to terms with what has happened. The school is closed today so that children can spend time with their families but staff say they reopen tomorrow. The time is almost 1:20pm. Our top story this lunchtime. After 1+ years of civil war - the Syrian President Bashar al-ASsad defends the conduct of his forces in an exclusive interview with the BBC. And still to come. A £1.5 million payout for babies swapped at birth in France. Coming up in the sport, world rugby have not sanction the Welsh Rugby union, they say George North should have been substituted against England in the six Nations as part of their concussion protocol. It’s a new app aimed at parents who are worried about what their children are doing online on their tablets and phones. It’s being launched later this year and means you will be able to monitor everything they’re up to. But is it in important useful tool for parents, in invasion of privacy, or even worse? Katie Green has got a schoolbag to pack, Indigo is the diary, the homework and of course, her smartphone -- diary, the homework and of course, her smartphone -- in they go.

What is he up to? Playing Candy Crush. Katie ‘s friends are not all convinced it’s a good idea. I don’t like people being in my room, let alone seeing every single text message I send.

Lucy left her husband years ago but he still follows her using software he downloaded onto her sons phone. I want to move on, I don’t want my ex-husband in my life but knowing he is tracking me where ever I go, whether it is with GPS or on the Internet or iPhone, it feels like I don’t have a life. Constantly I’m looking over my shoulder. So technology designed to protect in the wrong hands can become an intimidating tool of control. The country’s top financial regulator has been accused of giving in to pressure from banks over a compensation scheme for mis-sold financial products. MPs say thousands of small businesses were ripped off by the banks and were ‘in danger of being done over a second time’. Our economics correspondent Andy Verity is here. This is the business equivalent of PPI mis-selling? Very much, just as if you applied for a loan or mortgage you might be asked if you wanted to buy Payment Protection Insurance, if you were business, the bank might say, we are worried interest rates could rise. You might not keep up payments so we will sell you insurance. What they didn’t sell the business is, if interest rates fell it would be the business and not the bank that coughed up and thatis not the bank that coughed up and that is what happened. Interest rates fall, and the banks find the businesses need to cough up huge amounts, businesses ran into trouble and a lot of them were brought to the brink of ruin with devastating personal consequences for families and those that had built the businesses. The Financial Conduct Authority set up a compensation scheme which were supposed to sort this out but unfortunately the MPs say the banks pressured the regulator, so that it’s skewed the compensation scheme in favour of the banks. There is supposed to be an independent review about the banks made sure he only saw the documents they saw, and the regulator was asked how this could be fair. There is nojustice system in the world that would allow a victim of a crime to have to submit their evidence to the perpetrator of a crime to edit the information to subject it, too a closed court. This is completely and totally unjust. What have you to say? You are using a high charge term, crime, we’re not dealing with crime, it is conduct issues... Martin Wheatley, the head of the regulator, but the MPs say their constituents would regard this as a crime because they’ve lost their businesses and in many cases their homes. A 25 year old man from Gateshead has appeared in court, accused of assaulting a disabled pensioner. Alan Barnes suffered a broken collar bone in the incident in the Gateshead injanuary - which sparked an internet campaign. More than £330,000 was raised in an appeal to help him. Danny Savage is at Gateshead Magistrates Court. A few people will have missed the plight of Alan Barnes over the last few weeks, the frail pensioner who lived in Gateshead, very distinctive looking, poor eyesight, four tall, he was knocked over in an assault outside his own home at the end of january -- fourfeet outside his own home at the end of january -- four feet five full. Pensioners being mugged is not unheard of, but what is extraordinary about this saga, a 21-year-old local woman who’d never met him set up an online campaign to raise some cash to buy him some new bits and pieces for his own. Two weeks later, it has raised £330,000, the story went global. People gave donations from all over the world to help him. What has happened today is that a man has appeared in court in Gateshead, accused of assault and intent to rob. That man’s name is Richard Gattis, he’s 25 years old and appeared in a hearing this morning, we heard a bit more detail about what is alleged to have happened on that day. Alan Barnes heard a man saying hand over your money and begin to rummage through his pockets, Mr Barnes fell over. He was putting out his wheelie bin and he was assaulted, he raised the alarm with a neighbour and Mr Barnes broke his collarbone in the process. The assailant made off but the police have had what they call the relentless investigation and they’ve arrested somebody and the man will appear in the court in two weeks time, meanwhile he’s been remanded in custody. Two French families whose babies were accidently switched at birth more than 20 years ago have been awarded one and a half million pounds in compensation. In 1991+ the newborn girls were placed in the same incubator in a clinic in Cannes. But when staff took them out - they returned them to the wrong families. The ten years no one realised that they’d gone home with the wrong baby. They feel in every way like mother and daughter. But they are not. When Sophie Serrano’s daughter was born she was treated forjaundice, another girl shared the incubator and Sophie was given that baby, the wrong baby, to take home. Afterfour days they brought me a baby and I was taken aback because she had more hair, so I asked what was going on, I could not imagined what had happened. It was odd and I mentioned it and the nurse answered it was the ultraviolet rays which made her hair grow more quickly. Manon Grew up happily but it was strange because she had dark skin, neighbours gossip and the husband was suspicious so they had a DNA test which revealed the truth, that neither of them was her parent. TRANSLATION: I was thinking if I am not her mother then the daughter I gave birth to must be in anotherfamily the daughter I gave birth to must be in another family somewhere, sol was afraid, what she OK, what she being looked after, what she alive? I was petrified. Sophie got into much with Manon’s, real parents, who were bringing up her real daughter but it didn’t work out, feelings were too confused and too intense. TRANSLATION: Ifound myself with were too confused and too intense. TRANSLATION: I found myself with two mothers, two fathers and several brothers and sisters and I could not work out where I belonged because there was my mother but she was not mY there was my mother but she was not my birth mother. How do you react when you find out you should have been someone else? One can only imagine. You’re watching the BBC News at One. It’s almost 1:30pm. In a red BBC interview President Assad has defended his actions and those of his military during four years of civil war -- a rare interview. The Syrian president, Bashar Al Assad, has told the BBC Ina moment, In a moment, we will have a full national weather forecast, but first let’s get all the day’s sport. World Rugby has said the Welsh Rugby Union won’t face sanctions after allowing George North to finish Friday’s Six Nations clash with England - despite 2 clear blows to the head. I’m joined by our Wales correspondent Hywel Griffith, who’s at the Team Hotel, where a news conference hasjust been held. What is the latest after World Rugby’s investigation? The sport’s governing body has agreed with many rugby fans that George North should not have played on after that second blow to the head he received in the game against England on Friday night. Vitally, they have condoned the Welsh Rugby Union’s actions. That second blow to the head was not seen by the medical staff and George North appeared to be fine, in fact he showed no symptoms after the game. They have agreed with the Welsh Rugby Union’s suggestion that now on the team will be given playback material pitchside. Was there any indication given that North would play this weekend against Scotland? That is the big question. We will get the team announcement for Wales tomorrow. The suggestion was that he could be named tomorrow. If he is named in the first 15 to face Scotland, it is not entirely sure whether he will play, he will have to remain symptom-free for the rest of the week. Thank you. He is a former City trader who has swapped the high stakes of the financial world with football management. But manager Mark Warburton - who in his first manager’sjob has led Brentford into the Championship play-off places after promotion last season, may be replaced at the end of the season. The BBC’s Ben Smith was granted behind the scenes access to the inner workings of one of the Football League’s most upwardly mobile clubs. Winter may have hit West London last week, but Brentford have been breaking new ground. For the first time in 21 years, they are playing in the second tier of English football, having won promotion from League One last season. This term, that success has snowballed. Mark Warburton swapped the banks for the Brentford Bees. Itraded Warburton swapped the banks for the Brentford Bees. I traded yen. Brentford Bees. Itraded yen. I would be at my desk by 6.15am and that was the life. It was great. A team of dealers working hard together, the team work, the communication, the desire, the feeling when you have a good day. The horrible feeling when you have a bad day, your budget has been hit. It is all about that camaraderie and the similarities to the dressing room is incredible. Under his guidance, Brentford have got into the top four of the Championship. It is those experiences that appear to be paying dividends now. He’s had great experience within football and good experience outside football, and outside football managing people as well. The methods being used here have paid off spectacularly over the last 18 months. The real question now is how far can Brentford go? They are good enough to go up. They know what they can achieve. The rub of the green, the random calls go our way, we will be in a good place. Brentford’s stock may be on the rise. But the BBC has learned the manager’s future is far from certain. Football, like the city, is a cut-throat world, nothing lasts forever. That’s all sport for now. It’s a performance that’s already landed her awards at the BAFTAs and Golden Globes - and is strongly tipped to earn an Oscar. In her latest film, Still Alice, julianne Moore plays a professor of linguistics and mother of three but when she starts to forget her words, she receives a devastating diagnosis of early onset Alzheimer’s Disease. Our Entertainment Correspondent, Colin Paterson, has been to meet her. Alice, where the hell were you? I went for a run. I hope you enjoyed that because you completely blew our dinner plans. The film you have been winning a lot of awards for this year is Still Alice. And it is a serious subject matter? Yeah, yeah, it is. I think it’s something that people feel isolated, they don’t feel represented. I mean, there have been films about Alzheimer’s before but generally, from the point of view of a family member, or a care giver. I did a lot of research because I felt it wasn’t - I needed to know, you know, I needed to see for myself. How much did you know beforehand? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I’m very fortunate in that Alzheimer’s hasn’t touched my life personally in any way. I had no experience, I had no knowledge and so I spent about four months really researching it and spending time with people in the community. I can see the words hanging in front of me and I can’t reach them and I don’t know who I am and I don’t know what I’m going to lose... Stethoscope, hedgehog... You spoke to a lot of people who had early onset Alzheimer’s including someone who was just 1+5. Most people do not realise it can affect people that young? Exactly. Only 5% of the Alzheimer’s population is diagnosed with early onset, you know. The rest is after 65. Lisa Genova, who wrote the book, deliberately made the character younger so people could see, to illustrate the fact dementia is a disease, it is not a condition of aging. I think traditionally people felt like you get older and dementia is one of the things that happens. It’s not. It’s disease. So, I think the more people are made aware of that, the more we can put our thoughts and research towards it and hopefully find a cure. Time for a look at the weather with Darren Bett. No prizes for guessing it is variations on a cloudy theme this week. It is pretty cold out there in Lincolnshire right now. That fog, though, is slowly lifting, but we do have much more cloud around today than we had yesterday. The contrast is quite stark. This was lunch time yesterday. You can see the clear skies, the breaks in the cloud, temperatures 11 degrees. This is the cloudy scene many of us have today. The more reliable sunshine is in eastern Scotland and North East England. Not quite as gloomy through the afternoon, possibly across more southern parts of the UK. That fog is lifting here. The cloud is lifting. For many of us, we will have cloudy skies. We are likely to have clearer skies in North East Scotland for a while. Here, we will find a frost forming overnight. Touch-and-go with the frost in Northern Ireland, North Wales. So, it should be above freezing across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, we shouldn’t have the fog that we had this morning. Some patchy fog in North East England. A frost as well. The sunshine should be coming through before too long. The rest of Scotland will see more cloud. A bit chilly in Northern Ireland. Maybe a few breaks in the cloud here. A similar story across North Wales. A bit milder with more reliable cloud. It should be a mild enough start but a cloudy start across the South West of England. We had a lot of fog here this morning. We are not expecting the fog across more southern parts of England. It will be more a case of cloud. Skies may be a little bit brighter tomorrow. Generally speaking, a lot of cloud around. It is North East England that is likely to get more sunshine. Temperatures could get into double figures. Otherwise, 5, 6, 7 or so. could get into double figures. Otherwise, 5, 6, 7 orso. Again, a lot of cloud, I suspect, on Thursday, something brighterfor Thursday, something brighter for eastern Thursday, something brighterfor eastern parts of the UK. Further west, the cloud is thick enough to give us a few showers. Temperatures are round about average for this time of the year. At the end of the week, this low pressure is spinning our way. It looks like it should tend to push its way down into the near continent. That is where we will see most of the rain. There is a risk of rain towards the end of the week. A lot of cloud around. That will limit the frost and the fog. A chance of rain in the east by the end of the week. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: President Assad has defended the action of his military forces during four years of civil war in Syria. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Alex Bushill. The Attorney General’s been asked to investigate the way a Bengali newspaper is covering the trial of alleged election fraud in Tower Hamlets involving the mayor Lutfur Rahman. The London Bangla Newspaper has called the trial ‘a witch hunt’ and 'an attack on all Bangladeshis’. The trial involves claims of ballot paper tampering, bribery and voter intimidation - all of which Mr Rahman denies. The newspaper’s editor has so far declined to comment. The Mayor’s flagship cycle superhighway is facing further problems, after officials at the Royal Parks Agency objected to segregated lanes passing in front of Buckingham Palace. They are calling for the current plans to be routed along the Mall instead. The Mayor’s Cycling Commissioner says they are working with The Royal Parks to resolve to issue. If London delivered a successful Olympics, cashing in on them is another challenge altogether. No wonder then, the Mayor is using his current tour of the United States to forge links with those hoping to take the Games to Boston. Our Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, is there. It was supposed to be a whistle-stop tour of the States. But Boston’s snow has made it more of a crawl. Events have had to be cancelled as the city has ground to a halt. There was a failed attempt to ride the local Tube, the snow put paid to that as the Mayor had to delay a meeting on Boston’s plans for the Olympics. He did get to try and convince some locals, though. What was your name again? Borisjohnson. Ido remember you from the Olympics last year, two years ago. You did a really good job. It is going to cause havoc in the city, nobody will be able to get around, similar to how we’re having a snowstorm today. Imagine that for 17 days. Given the weather, you might think Boston was going for the Winter Olympics. It’s not. It’s going for the 2021+ Summer Games. Unlike London, this is a bid that’s led by the private sector. But they still want to learn lessons from what happened in London, hence the meetings between Borisjohnson and America’s answer to Seb Coe. This is him, john Fish, a man who will have to convince a sceptical city that buildings won’t be left empty and costs won’t spiral. Probably most importantly to us is the legacy value, how the Olympic and Paralympic Games transformed the City of London in such a thoughtful way and how inclusive it was. If we look at that as a model, it is probably the best Olympic Games ever. The man in the suit has waved the Olympic Flag at the Games. The guy in the jeans hopes to. Marty Walsh is Boston’s Mayor, dealing with snow and an Olympic bid. London was very sceptical about the Olympics and it’s very much the same here in Boston. How do you convince Bostonians this is a good thing? People should ask questions and people should be asking me and the Olympic 2021+, who is going for the bid as well, the questions that they want the answers to. We are certainly worried about taxpayers’ money going into an Olympic bid. People want to understand what the short-term effects of the Olympics will be, what the long-term effects of the Olympics will be. Sceptical Bostonians will have to wait until 2017 to see if their city is chosen to host the Games. They’ll hope speaking to London may make theirs a battle they can win. Karl Mercer, BBC London News, in Boston. A West London hospital trust has been rated as requiring improvement over concerns about patient safety, infection control and a shortage of nurses. Hillingdon and Mount Vernon hospitals were inspected by the Care Quality Commission last October. The Trust says it already has in place plans to deal with the problems. Now the weather with Kate Kinsella. Good afternoon. It’s been a cloudy day so far. And this afternoon is going to stay rather grey. We may get one or two thinner areas of cloud where we could get some bright spells, but predominantly it is rather cloudy. The temperature reflects that. There was much more sunshine around yesterday afternoon, ",,
50,BBC News 24,10-feb-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"Syria’s President Assad denies any responsibility for the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed his country. In a rare interview, he tells the BBC accusations of human rights violations against his own people are childish. 200,000 people have been killed in the war. The president denies claims the Syrian army has used barrel bombs against its own people. When you shoot, you aim and when you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians, again if you are talking about casualties, that is war, you cannot have war without casualties. Mr Assad also claims America is passing information to Syria about the fight against Islamic State, via Iraq.

A court begins hearing evidence the case. Good evening. In a rare interview, a defiant president Assad of Syria has told the BBC he still has the support of his people and that he is not responsible for the humanitarian crisis in his country. War has been raging in Syria for almost four years, 200,000 people have been killed, nine million displaced by the fighting. The president dismissed as childish claims by human rights observers and the UN that the Syrian army has used indiscriminate violence against its own people. The British foreign secretary has responded by calling Assad deluded or lying. The area in green here marks where Mr Assad’s forces still have control of Syria. All the rest is in the hands of Islamic State extremists, rebel gI’oUpS oI’ I’Io OFIE oI’g8I’IiS8tioI’I. The president was speaking exclusively to our Middle East editor jeremy Bowen. President Assad’s officials promised an interview to the BBC last autumn, but with the Americans just starting to bomb Islamic State in Syria, they said events were moving too fast. Mr Assad’s appearance now in a guesthouse at the presidential palace in Damascus is a sign he feels more secure. Defending the Syrian armed Forces robustly. I’ve spent time on the front line with soldiers the Syrian army who insisted that they were page your deck, that they were patriots, they were not cold-blooded killers, but I’ve also interviewed people and many other journalists I’ve also interviewed people and many otherjournalists and human rights people and so on, who say that they have suffered badly at the hands of Syrian soldiers. They can’t all have been lying, surely. How, surely? How are you sure? Because of the weight of testimony, human rights watch injanuary the weight of testimony, human rights watch in january this year has said forces loyal to Bashar Al-Assad, ""have deliberately and viciously attacked civilians using indiscriminate weapons no Tory asleep barrel bombs. ""This indiscriminate weapons no Tory asleep barrel bombs. "" This is a childish story. Childish? Childish because somebody who is against his people, somebody who survives, how? You don’t deny your forces use barrel bombs? They use bullets and bombs but I haven’t heard of that. Large barrels full of explosives and projectiles dropped from helicopters that explode with ever stating a fact. There has been lots of testimony about this. We have bombs, missiles and bullets. So you would not deny that included under the category of bombs are these barrel bombs? They are indiscriminate weapons. There are no indiscriminate weapons, when you shoot you aim and when you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians come again, if you are talking about casualties, thatis you are talking about casualties, that is war, you cannot have war without casualties. On the fight against Islamic State and Al-Qaeda, the US and others have said you cannot be a partner in that fight. Would you like to be a partner? Would you like tojoin? A partner with who? A partner with the countries attacking Islamic State? We don’t have the will, for one reason, because we cannot be in an alliance with a country that supports terrorism. Do you talk to the Americans? There are American planes above Syria the whole time, do you coordinate? No, they don’t talk to anyone. They trample over international law, which is about our sovereignty. They don’t talk to us and we don’t talk to them. I’m curious that at a time when there is the American military in the air over Syria and your air force, the Syrian air force is in the air above Syria, and they have not been any incidents between the two. No shots seem to have been traded. No planes have been shot down. That suggests to me that someone is talking to someone. That is correct but again there is no direct cooperation. Is it via Iraq, that’s what some have said. That is through a third party, Iraq and another party, sometimes they convey messages, but there is nothing tactical. So they don’t tell you we will be bombing Raqqa at 10pm this evening, keep out of the way? We knew about the campaign before it started but we didn’t know the details. Is that a continuing dialogue that you have through third parties? There is no dialogue. Let’s say, there is information but no dialogue. They tell you things? Something like this. Do you tell them things? No. When we do something on our territory we don’t ask anyone and we don’t tell anyone. What keeps you awake at night? What keeps me awake at night? Many reasons that could affect any human. Life, it could be personal, it could be your work. Yourjob? It could be yourjob, it could be personal, I’m human, what could any human be affected by? Not long after the interview the Syrian air force was attacking a rebel held suburb of Damascus. Civilians still live here too. Short of food and medical supplies. In the interview the President rejected the UN’s complaint that his government had blocked relief aid to besieged areas. The Syrian war is made up of layers of conflict. As a new one is added ending the killing gets more, located. jeremy Bowen is in Beirut. Foreign secretary Philip Hammond says Assad is deluded or lying, your assessment of him? ~ I was quite surprised, I have to say, when the President denied effectively the use of barrel bombs. He might have found a better explanation than the one he did. He tried quite a flippantjoke about using cooking pots as well as barrels. The fact is there is a lot of evidence that those bombs are being used. And as well as that that they are killing civilians. Some of the other things he said were matters of opinion and others were quite revelatory, like the fact they are having some connections via the Iraqis with the Americans. But in general, President Assad was relaxed, and as well as that he was pushing some very strong lines from his point of view. Which is, as far as he’s concerned, he’s fighting terrorism. Yes, casualties happen in war, but he didn’t start it. And he would say that the casualties that the Syrian army inflicted are ones that have been forced on them by being attacked. Clearly those words are controversial and there are many people around the world like the British Foreign Secretary who will reject them utterly. jeremy Bowen, thank you. Police say a four year old girl who was walking with her grandmother - and three men in a car- were all killed in Bath yesterday when a tipper truck ran out of control. Five people are being treated in hospital including the little girl’s grandmother, who’s in a critical condition. Our correspondent jon Kay is at the scene of the accident in Bath for us. More details are emerging now about what happened yesterday. This afternoon we have learned the name of the little girl who died here. She was Mitzi Rosanna Steady, just four years old, and lived in Bath. All afternoon herfriends have been coming here to leave flowers in her memory and leaving messages and prayers on a board that has gone up behind me at the scene. We’ve also been learning more about three men who died at the same time when their car was crushed by this tipper truck. One of them had only recently got married. 21+ hours on this community is still reeling tonight from what happened here. Loved and missed by all, a tribute from the family of Mitzi Rosanna Steady, four years old and killed by a tipper truck as she crossed the road with her grandma. The 32-tonne lorry has now been removed. Police believe it was out of control as it came crashing down the steep hill, hitting Mitzi and crushing a car. The three men inside that vehicle were also killed. It’s understood the driver of the car was 31+-year-old Stephen Vaughan from Swansea. His two male passengers were both in their 50s and also from South Wales. just down the hill, local children came to remember Mitzi and the others who died. This community is stunned by the suddenness of what happened yesterday afternoon. It was glorious sunshine and that fresh cold weather that goes with February. And out of nowhere, literally, such a terrible disaster should happen. She was a lovely, sweet little girl, beautiful and always very happy. We are all devastated. Especially the child. The lorry crashed right outside a primary school at pick-up time. This is where it overturned and spilled tonnes of aggregate onto the road. We stopped two feet away. Rob’s car was very nearly hit as well. He told me the lorry driver had been sounding his horn repeatedly as it came down the hill to warn people there was a problem. Was he able to explain what happened? He was trying to comprehend, he was just completely in shock. He was saying he could see the children on the crossing and was trying and he was fighting with the brakes. As this community grieves the lorry driver has been treated for minor injuries. Police believe he had been trying to avert an even worse accident. Meanwhile, Mitzi Steady’s grandmother remains in a critical condition. jon Kay, BBC News, Bath. Sharp differences between the main political parties over business and Europe were highlighted again today. Both Labour and the Conservatives issued warnings at the British Chambers of Commerce Annual Conference. The Prime Minister said Labour would demonise business leaders - who would be treated as the enemy. But the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls warned of the risk to the economy - posed by an EU referendum. Our political editor Nick Robinson reports. It isa It is a tale of two warnings, warnings to British business of the alleged dire consequences of ending UP alleged dire consequences of ending up with the wrong party in government. On inks from the Tories and from labour that if their opponents getting there will be hell to pay. The venue, the British Chambers of Commerce annual, and is. The audience, business leaders who trooped into here first one politician and then another trying to scare them rigid. I warn you not to grow your business because they’ll come after you, I warn you not to take people on because they will slap taxes on you. If you are of a certain age it will sound familiar, it’s meant to, the Tories want to remind you of a former Labour leader who lost an election. If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday I warn you not to the ordinary, I warn you not to be young. I warn you not to create wealth because they will demonise you because you are the enemy in their mind. The Prime Minister boasted about what his government had done for them but chose not to address his own policy on Europe, which this organisation’s bosses warned will create uncertainty, which is bad for business. Shouldn’t you be saying to business, I warn you I might not get a better deal in the EU, Iwarn you I might not get a better deal in the EU, I warn you the EU, Iwarn you I might not get it on the timetable I want and I warn you I might take you out of Europe by mistake? Well, I wouldn’t put it like that for obvious reasons! This organisation backs the promise of a referendum on the EU but they warn it needs to be held as soon as possible. They are saying it’s right to have a strategy that gives Britain the best chance of staying in a reformed European Union that works in our interests. Earlier the Shadow Chancellor, not as many noted here his leader, came to reassure that Labour was pro-business and he also came with his own warning about the risks he said were opposed by the Tories’ approach to Europe. The threat of leaving the European Union is the biggest risk to British investment and jobs in this decade. And I don’t think setting an arbitrary fast timetable is going to help deliver the stability which business needs. Which warning should business take more seriously? The Prime Minister’s about Labour’s attitude to business, or the Shadow Chancellor’s about the Tories putting our membership of the EU at risk? The truth is, the businessmen and women here are having to learn to live with an enormous amount of political uncertainty. Even some Tory supporters seem unsure what they should fear most. Is he right to say that you should fear Labour? I think I do fear Labour as a business. Do you fear an EU referendum might take us out of the EU? I don’t want to come out of the EU? So you do fear them? Yes. So they are both right? I guess so. Barack Obama has confirmed that a US aid worker- held hostage by Islamic State - has been killed. The extremists claimed last week that she had died in a bombing raid. The family of Kayla Mueller said in a statement they were heartbroken to learn of her death - and released a copy of the last letter she wrote to them while in captivity. Our North America Editorjon Sopel has more. ~ Iam in I am in solidarity with the Syrian people. I reject the brutality and killing... Kayla Mueller had gone to Syria to help those affected by the brutal civil war. She recorded this video in solidarity with the Syrian people two years before she found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time, like many others, was captured in alel owe by Islamic State fighters. Last Friday IS claimed she had been killed in a jordanian airstrike. Whether that is true or not, her family received evidence over the weekend that she had died. Today, they released this letter from Kayla in which she wrote: In confirming Kayla’s death the President issued a statement saying that the US will hunt and bring to justice those responsible no matter how long it takes. He also said that Islamic State’s abhorrent actions stand in stark contrast to the spirit of people like Kayla. For the United States, this might bring to an end an unhappy chapter that started with the beheading ofjames Foley. In her hometown in Arizona they prayed until the very last moment that this might have a different outcome. It wasn’t to be. Today, her parents issued a statement saying they were heartbroken. jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington. Our top story this evening. President Assad of Syria tells the BBC he is not responsible for the humanitarian crisis engulfing his country. And could you spot the fake? A London art gallery challenges visitors to spot a Chinese replica Later on BBC London: And he may be the fan’s favourite, but could Brentford be looking for a new manager to replace Mark Warburton? In the last hour, football’s Premier League has announced its latest multimillion pound deal to broadcast live games. The total package is more than £5 billion for the agreement which runs from 2016 to 2019. That’s 70% more than the last deal. Dan Roan is in central London where it’s been announced. It’s an eye-watering sum? It is. It will reinforce the view that those at the bottom of the sport are yet to see a fair slice of the spoils, especially the time when footballers earn up to £300,000 a week. Today’s record-breaking deal could just be record-brea king deal could just be the record-breaking deal could just be the result of the season for those players, their clubs and their agents. The numbers involved are quite simply staggering. That £5 billion deal represents a 70% increase, as you say, on the current three-year deal it. Means that Sky and BT will pay for each and every match they broadcast more than £10 million. As they look to try to take advantage of the enduring appeal of English football and use it to drive customers towards other services such as mobile phone, line rentl and broadband. Ispoke such as mobile phone, line rentl and broadband. I spoke to the League’s Chief Executive a few minutes ago. Obviously the clubs have a product. It’s a product they want to sell. It’s a good deal for everybody. Good deal for our clubs, also everybody. Good deal for our clubs, also all the clubs in English football and the organisations and charities that do depend on Premier League revenues. The league makes the point it gives around a sixth of its income away to good causes and in the former parachute payments it PGYS in the former parachute payments it pays billions of pounds worth of tax it has to compete rival leagues. At a time when ticket prices keep going UP a time when ticket prices keep going up forfans a time when ticket prices keep going upforfans and a time when ticket prices keep going up for fans and when grass-roots facilities up-and-down the country are in need of investment this will spark fresh calls, especially before the election, for more of that money to be redistributed throughout the game. Dan Roan, in central London, thank you. A 25-year-old man has appeared in court charged with assaulting disabled pensioner, Alan Barnes. Mr Barnes, who’s 67, suffered a broken collarbone in the attack outside his home in Gateshead last month. More than £330,000 has been raised for him in an online appeal- set up by 21-year-old local, Katie Cutler. Ajury at the Old Bailey has heard that a Muslim convert told police that he would ""harm"" David Cameron if he got the chance. Prosecutors allege that Brusthom Ziamani, who’s 19, was planning to kill a British soldier when he was arrested in London last August with a knife and a hammer. He denies a charge of preparing an act of terrorism. Prince Charles has met the new King of Saudi Arabia today as part of his tour of the Middle East. He raised the case of the jailed blogger, Raif Badawi, with King Salman. Mr Badawi has been imprisoned for 10 years and sentenced to 1,000 lashes for insulting Islam. Our Royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, reports from the Saudi capital, Riyadh. When Royals meet Royals, there’s always a sort of unspoken bond. Stretched a little today in Riyadh by the sheer number of Saudi princes who queued up for a handshake from Prince Charles, but the special Royal to Royal relationship was evident again when Charles sat down with Saudi Arabia’s new King, Salman. It was during these talks that Charles raised the question of Saudi Arabia’s treatment of Raif Badawi, he’s the Saudi citizen who set up an online network to discuss human rights in Saudi Arabia. For that, he was sentenced to 10-years in prison and 1,000 lashes. He received the first 50 of those lashes in public last month. I spoke on the internet to Mr Badawi’s sister, Samar. So what did she hope someone like Prince Charles could do to help her brother? Will Prince Charles’s intervention have any effect? That’s difficult to say because, for all Britain’s concern about human rights here, the reality is that the West needs Saudi Arabia’s support in the struggle against extremism. British diplomats say Saudi Arabia has become an important partner in combatting Islamist extremism rather than being part of the problem which causes that extremism. Principle versus pragmatism. A Prince’s gentle advocacy for a Saudi who dared to challenge his country’s rulers. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Riyadh. Now, do you think you could spot a fake? That’s the challenge set by one art gallery which has put a modern replica made in China into its collection of Old Masters. Dulwich Picture Gallery is giving visitors three months to see if they can pick it out. We asked our arts editor, Will Gompertz, to have a go. The Dulwich Picture Gallery was purpose-built in 1811 as a place where the public could inspect paintings. And, 200 years later, that is exactly what they are doing, inspecting paintings to spot the Chinese fake the gallery has hung in place of one of its Old Masters. The regulars are scratching their heads. I mean, I come to this gallery fairly frequently, but I don’t I would recollect every picture and know and be able to say - that’s wrong. Somebody said it’s like if you’re favourite sofa in your sitting room changed, you should be able to tell. So I’ll have another closer look and see. OK, so they’re not quite sure, but might a convicted art forger be able to identify the bogus picture? I’m going to set you a challenge. I want you to go round, have a look at all the paintings, and decide which one is the fake. Impossible. I’ll do my very best. While he goes off to scrutinise the paintings, I went to have a word with the man whose idea it was to pay a Chinese artist £100 to make the fake. What goes on when you’re looking at a piece of work and saying- oh, I think that’s wonderful. If that’s going on, and you find out after the fact it was not what you thought you were looking at, that I think is quite interesting. john, you are looking at a Reubens here, how can you judge whether it’s fake or not? There’s a certain kind of skill here, a facility. The man is completely at ease with his brush, his colours and his paints and everything, that’s why, 100%, I’m sure this is a genuine Reubens. The search goes on until... What’s wrong with this then? Well, it’s the brush work. To me, itjust looks... Clumsy? It’s... the brush work is supposed to define the form, go round the form, and here itjust doesn’t. It’s just messy. For my money, this is Mr Dodgy. So, he thinks he’s found the culprit, but is it a Rembrandt, Canaletto or Pusan or none of the above, you have got three months to come and see for yours elf before the gallery reveals all. Will Gompertz, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather, her’s Alex Deakin. A pale imitation of yesterday across the country. Largely dry. Much more cloud around today compared to yesterday. There is breaks in the cloud Across parts of north-east England, eastern Scotland seeing sunshine here. For most, it has been a drab Tuesday. We will keep the cloud across much of the UK tonight. Not producing much in the way of rain. Dry and cloudy for most. North-east England and eastern Scotland there could be fog. We will see temperatures below freezing. Most places with the cloud will stay above freezing. More cloud in north-west Scotland providing light rain. Another dry day tomorrow for most. Fog to eastern and northern Scotland and north-east England. There will be a frost here as well. Elsewhere temperatures will start above freezing, not as foggy as it was this rng morning. The winds will be lighter. Not a lot to shift the cloud around. It will stick with us for most of the day. It will brighten up a little bit through the day. We won’t see much sunshine except across the north-eastern quarter of the UK. We should see a little bit of blue sky. For most, cloudy and dry is the main theme of tomorrow. It will feel on the cool side. The temperatures a touch below average five to seven Celsius. Where we see the sunshine, again double likely. Spot the difference on Thursday. Dry and cloudy. Maybe a few light showers. Temperatures in single figures. Cloud to Scotland and rain from this weather front. More of a change Thursday night into Friday. Uncertainty about this low pressure system. It will throw some showery rain across the country on Friday. That is the exception. As we go into the weekend we are back to the largely dry weather with a fair bit of cloud around. Not a huge amount of sunshine, not much rain in the forecast either. Thank you very much. Our main story tonight. President Assad of Syria tells the BBC he’s not responsible for the humanitarian crisis in his country. That’s all from the BBC News at Six. It’s goodbye from me. On BBC One Tonight on BBC London News: Claims from one of the Mayor’s most senior advisors that Tube fares are too high. Borisjohnson has put up fares by 2.7%. You have got to look at ways at maximising the income without clobbering the Tube user. But Borisjohnson has hit back, defending his record on the cost of public transport. Also tonight: The Muslim convert accused of planning to behead a British soldier. A court hears he warned police he’d ""harm"" the Prime Minister. A bump in the road for the latest cycle superhighway - why it won’t run in front of Buckingham Palace. And restored to their natural beauty, treasures from one of the largest hoards of Anglo-Saxon coins go on show to the public here at the British Museum. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Victoria Hollins. One of Boris johnson’s closest advisors has clashed with transport bosses, by claiming that the cost of travelling on the Tube is too high. Stephen Greenhalgh is one of the Mayor’s deputies and wants to run for London’s top job - he’s pledged a 3% cut to fares each year if elected. Opponents have seized on the row, saying it reveals a failure by the current City Hall administration. But tonight, Boris johnson’s defended his record on public transport. Here’s our political editor, Tim Donovan. You have been paying too much and you should be paying less. That was the view of one Deputy Mayor. Stephen Greenhalgh has been cutting the police budget but has said he can do the same for the Tube each year but 80% cut. People using his own card would save £770. Zones one to three would save over £900. Over that period a saving of £11+00 would be achieved for those between zones one and six. He claims these cuts would not affect investment but others are sceptical. You cannot square the circle of increasing levels of investment and cutting fares unless you tackle the new revenue streams and taxes. That is the only way you can do this. When you talk about efficiency savings, quite a lot of them are already targeted by Transport for London, 16 bulging over the next five years. Transport for London agreed with that and said... This would inevitably result in cuts to current plans they said. The opponents of the Mayor today said that this was about his record and leadership. Because they claim Stephen Greenhalgh was admitting that the London Mayor could have done more to keep the cost of rail fares down. This was a very strong criticism of the Boris johnson’s This was a very strong criticism of the Borisjohnson’s administration by one of his own team members. He is saying that the financial strategy of Borisjohnson was incorrect. We have continued to keep our fares at a reasonable price. We have vital investment that when the needs and we are maintaining that and a fantastic service for all passengers in London. As for other candidates for future Mayor ‘s, they will have to take their decisions. I do what they think is best for the city. Stephen Greenhalgh said that they were putting London on a better ",,

Boris has recognised you have to increase commercial revenue. But you have to put the afterburners on. 200 million each year? I think he could do when logging. Some will want to see the small print before they believe such fares cuts are possible. Lots more to come including: Falling milk prices force one farmer to look at new ways of dairy farming, but will shoppers buy intensively-farmed milk? A court’s heard that a teenage Muslim convert told police that he would harm David Cameron if he got the chance. Brusthom Ziamani was arrested in east London and is accused of planning to behead a British soldier. He denies a charge of preparing an act of terrorism. Richard Lister is at the Old Bailey. Today the court heard details of police interviews with Brusthom Ziamani over letters he was carrying when he was first arrested back in june. In those letters he wrote of non-Muslims, should them in the face and chest and Baron public houses with people in them. The court heard that he told police that he would harm the Prime Minister if given the opportunity and if asked to tell his own Christian parents he said it would be the will of Allah but he insisted he was not planning any attacks in the United Kingdom but instead wanted to fight in Serbia. But the court give evidence that he was planning attacks in London? The court heard that in police interviews he acknowledged using his mobile phone in trying to find the location of military barracks. But he said he was simply bored. When he was arrested in August he was carrying a knife, a hammerand an Islamic flag and Paul Moss, a prison officer, he told the court that he told him he had planned to behead a British soldier when he was arrested. He denies the charges against them and the allegations -- the trial continues. Tube drivers have voted to go on strike in protest at the sacking of a colleague. Members of the Rail Maritime and Transport union backed the industrial action by 299 votes to 221. London Underground says the driver failed two alcohol breath tests, and they operate a ""zero tolerance"" approach towards the consumption of alcohol. The RMT disputes the test results. A 16-year-old boy has been found guilty of murder after stabbing a man to death in his south-west London home. Usher Ricardo Sawyers was just 15 when he attacked 39-year-old Martin Thomas at his home in Roehampton last April. Sawyers had entered the property before stabbing Mr Thomas five times. He’s due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey in March. A crucial part of the Mayor’s plan to improve cycle safety has today hit a major problem. The Royal Parks are refusing to allow the development of a segregated lane in front of Buckingham Palace. The junction is one of London’s most dangerous, leaving Transport for London having to consider an alternative route for the superhighway. Here’s our transport correspondent, Tom Edwards. It’s one of the most well- known roads in the country passing Buckingham Palace and it was due to be part of the Mayor’s flagship East-West cycle route with separate cycle lanes like these. But they have been rejected. I am really worried about cyclists coming down here. They will be moving quite fast, because it is slightly downhill, and having a conflict with the pedestrians all waiting at the crossing. Whereas if they are in the road already, as is our plan, they will have to stop when the lights change and go when the lights change, and the flow will be completely regulated. The Royal Parks wants to route cyclists away from the roads onto shared footpaths. I am worried that we will get people going into this junction which is a very busy and intimidating junction. They will come off a nice section of segregated superhighway and they will suddenly find themselves in an unprotected junction and I am worried about that. The East-West Cycle Superhighway will eventually run from Acton to Tower Hill. It is meant to completely separate cyclists from other traffic. Here however, there will not be a cycle lane. Thisjunction is one of 33 in the capital that is meant to be being improved and as such, it is regarded as being dangerous. We are told that it is not the Palace that is objecting to the cycle lanes, but the Royal Parks. It says it will be looking at the plans and in due course it will respond to the consultation. There has been opposition to this scheme, particularly along the Embankment. It could still end up in court. Cycling campaigners however say the latest hold-up is outrageous. To hear that there is going to be a 300 metre gap in it, here of all locations, one of the busiest in London where there’s conflicts with pedestrians and motor cars, it is pretty outrageous! I think it is a bit embarrassing for the Mayor’s flagship scheme to be at risk from a big gaping hole like this. The consultation on this section closes in March. Unless the Royal Parks changes its mind, this will be a cycle superhighway with a big gap. Tom Edwards, BBC London News. The Government’s top legal advisor is to consider a complaint over the way a London Bengali newspaper is covering the Tower Hamlets election fraud trial. On his tour of the US, Borisjohnson’s been looking to maximise the benefits brought by London’s Olympics. He’s in Boston and has been meeting those behind the push to take the 2024 games to the city, hoping they’ll turn to London’s expertise if successful. Our political correspondent, Karl Mercer, has sent this report from Boston. It was supposed to be a whistlestop tour of the States. But this now in Boston has made it more of a crawl. Events have had to be cancelled as the city has ground to a halt. I’ve got to give a speech at 10 o’clock. Do you have a Lobster card? There was a failed attempt to ride the local Tube. They snow put paid to that as the Mayor had to put on hold a meeting to discuss Boston’s plans for the Olympics. He did try to convince some locals however. And be able to get around. Hello, I am more in common nice to meet you. Now you against this? I am a little bit wary about the crowds. The subway system and the transportation, getting everyone around. There may be problems. Given the weather, you could easily think that Boston was going for the Winter Olympics but instead it is going for the summer games. This was led by the private sector of this investment. The meetings between America’s answerto said coal and Borisjohnson have been meeting june to the similarities between the two cities. Borisjohnson will try to the similarities between the two cities. Boris johnson will try to convince them that the cost will not spiral out of control. We want to know how to London was transformed by both the Olympic games and Paralympic games, it is one of the best models of the Olympic Games ever created and held in the modern world. Of course, he would be keen, but we cost up one of the leading sports in Boston. She is not so convinced. There is eight cautious bars because people are sceptical as to what it means to be a bidding city for the Olympic Games. There are costs that lead to other development projects. There is concern of the process and it has not been that transparent. You seem very enthusiastic about this project. The man in the genes hopes to fly the flag at the games. -- denim jeans. to fly the flag at the games. -- denimjeans. London denim jeans. London was sceptical about the Olympic Games, how can you persuade the people of Boston to believe in these Olympic Games? That is correct. People want answers to questions. People are concerned about the money being spent. They want to understand what the short-term effects will be. I welcome these questions and I think people should have questions. I would be concerned if they did not. Sceptical people from Boston will have to wait until 2016 to see whether they have been successful in their bid for the games. Blind and partially-sighted people are finding it increasingly hard to make their way around London and many of them are hurting themselves because of the way the capital’s streets are laid out. The charity the RNIB says many people are so scared of the bollards, bins and cars parked on pavements, they don’t want to leave their homes. Ayshea Buksh reports. Mohammed has lived in Upton Park his entire life. He is blind and has overcome many obstacles but some still stand in his way. Mohammed took his fight for better access in his high street to the High Court and one. It forced the local council to invest in better pedestrian crossings for blind and visually impaired people. Navigating his way around the pavement is still undermining his confidence. Every time I leave my front door I am actually thinking about howl time I leave my front door I am actually thinking about how I can avoid items and not bump into things. You just want to stay indoors. According to the charity are in ID, Mohammed is one of thousands of partially sighted people who have injured themselves whilst out and about. It is more about the random items, shops with their premises extended across the pavement, tables and chairs that you are concerned about bumping into. They cannot be anticipated and seldom are in the same place. London will always be a busy and crowded city with buses, cars and people vying for space. Transport for London Sayedee have been actively decluttering the streets but they believe that it is up to local businesses as well as to ensure that the pavements are less squeezed. Newham Council has said it has played its part in taking away the clutter from the streets. Mohammed hopes this project will continue to help them each and every day. -- help him. Still to come: Discovered in a Buckinghamshire field - one of Britain’s largest hoards of Anglo-Saxon coins goes on display for the first time. Would you accept cheaper milk if it was produced by cows which sleep on sand and are intensively milked? Well, that’s what an Essex farmer says he’s had to do in order to keep costs down and his business afloat. Gareth Furby has been to Romford to meet him. Milk is cheaper. Good news for the consumers of London, but not for farmers. From the 1st of March we will reduce our prices by 1.5 pence per litre. Forjohn Collins who runs a farm near Romford, the price paid from old is done 5.5 p per litre since the 1st ofjanuary. This cost us £21+0,000 each year for production. He is fighting back. He has a huge investment in a new Baron which is home to over £300. It has cost usjust short which is home to over £300. It has cost us just short of £800,000. The callous lie on sand, not straw, saving thousands of pounds. They are also fed a special diet meaning that they can be milked more often. We milk them and spray out the mark. By getting more milk we can spread our cost over a large number of cows and hopefully do with this devastating news that we have received this week. Is it the correct way of doing things? Nearthe M25 week. Is it the correct way of doing things? Near the M25 is a farmer who disagrees. This is it, my second home. Peter Parkes has sold his milking parlour and his hair. home. Peter Parkes has sold his milking parlourand his hair. We could not go on working for nothing. He says that more farmers producing cheaper is the answer. We are taught to trim our costs and be more efficient, I have no idea how to do that. Would Londoners be happy to buy milk from intensively milked farms? The view today was mixed. I do not like the idea of ECO version of a battery chicken situation. If it is more cost effective, why not? john Torrens believes has farms are healthy as are his cows. My wife thinks that I love these animals more than horror! But even this Baron may not be enough to save him. Especially if the price of milk does not rise within a year. So, are Brentford Football Club searching for a new manager? According to one newspaper report this morning they are - in Spain - to replace fans’ favourite Mark Warburton at the end of the season. Our sports reporter Sara Orchard is here. Brentford are playing tonight, what have the club said? This has come off the back of an article in the Times newspaper this morning and it said that the ever popular Mark Warburton would be dismissed by Brentford at the end of the season. He is popular because he has got promotion last season and he is fourth in the championship and tonight they play Watford who lived in sixth position. Having said all of that, the report claimed that the chairman and owner had travelled to Spain to speak to a possible new manager to take over in the summer and the club have not exactly denied that in a statement today. Any more detail in that statement? They have said that Mark Warburton will lead the club but they have hinted as to why this trip may have happened. They have said that... They are almost hinting perhaps that he may have been offered anotherjob by another club. More questions than answers and we would urge all Brentford fans to tune into our radio sport show tonight. Find you, Sir for that update. -- radio sport show tonight. Find you, Sir for that update. -- thank you, Sarah, for that update. It’s one of the largest hoards of Anglo-Saxon coins ever found in Britain, discovered by a metal detector enthusiast in a Buckinghamshire field. Now they’re going on display for the very first time at the British Museum. And as our arts correspondent Brenda Emmanus reports, the collection is valued at more than £1million. From the muddy ground in this village, to the Shami cases of the British Museum, this is one of the largest Anglo-Saxon hordes of coins ever found and it is now on show to the public. Reunited with some of the coins he discovered last September, this man realised very quickly that he had discovered something special. Because of the size of the signal I realised whatever it was it was either a large number of lead with a reasonable amount of coins. In this gallery of the museum some of Paul’s fines will go on show to the public, preliminary identification suggest that some of the coins could have come from Ao minutes across England and include coins from the reins of the famous kings. It was the British Museum’s conservation team that put the sparkle Ba into these coins. -- team that put the sparkle Ba into these coins. -- sparkle back. The lead container sacrificed itself chemically for the good of the solver so that isjust in shreds of corrosion Ribery. I knew it was an important discovery when our expert in these coins in the museum came and sat by me next to the sink. As soon as I cleaned the coins, he read it. Basically we cleaned it with warm and soapy water and toothbrushes. It came up beautifully. They are worth over £1 million, how much of that did you get? The arrangement was 50-50 with the landowner. It is very surreal. If you are a famous actor, it is something you live with everyday, but when you are joe something you live with everyday, but when you arejoe Bloggs and something like this happens, it is difficult to your head around it. While he ponders how to spend his reward, the significance of Paul’s discovery will always remain priceless! Now the weather with Wendy Hurrell. Very cloudy conditions at the moment. You can see the amount of cloud coming from this high pressure at the moment. It affected the temperature today, just 7 degrees across much of London and the Home Counties. As we go into the evening and overnight, the lack of clear sky means that most of us should avoid a frost. There will be some of us who will not falter freezing but for most of us it will be three or A degrees tonight. We wake up tomorrow morning with that cloud like scene. It could produce one or two spots of drizzle here or there but nothing much more than that, it will be a dry and grey day. Not much of the breeze blowing and temperatures will vary, 7 degrees and London, but other places will remain at four or 5 degrees. It will not feel all that warm under that cloud. There is a small change the things later in the week on Friday when we have this low-pressure system. It will strengthen the winds. Coming in from a southerly direction and it should mix everything up returning to normal for the weekend. We have a similar day on Thursday, mostly cloudy and dry with a bit of drizzle. Moseley and Reece on Friday and hopefully that will get stirred UP and hopefully that will get stirred up for the weekend, so they could get sunny spells returning but not much for the next few days. The main headlines: Syria’s President Assad has denied any responsibility for the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed his country. In a rare interview, he told the BBC accusations of human rights violations against his own people are childish. Police say a four-year-old girl who was walking with her grandmother - and three men in a car- were all killed in Bath yesterday when a tipper truck ran out of control. Five people are being treated in hospital. And a court has heard that teenage Muslim convert Brusthom Ziamani told police he would harm David Cameron if he got the chance. He denies a charge of preparing an act of terrorism. join us again at 10:30pm. Goodbye. Comic Relief has crashed the Bake Off tent. On your marks. Get set.

She is a versatile actress and here she is in an early role of playing a Mother Superior. How do we best know her? That’s a good question. She gave up that habit and picked up a couple of bad ones. Please welcome Pam St Clement. It had to be done! Sorry, Pam. What a joker. When you think back to your time as Mother Superior, what’s the overriding memory and image it conjures up? A muddy field. On location. Where? I don’t know, I was taken there and that was it, it was a muddy field. Going on to Pat Butcher and her style, I always wondered how much did you have as an actress into what Pat looked like? Was that your vision or did she come like that as a character to you? I had a lot of input actually. I have always said that I never ever saw Pat in trousers. She was very much of her period, the skirt, the animal print. A slingback. The shoes, earrings. Did you ever see blouses and things out shopping and think that’s perfect, I will buy it? Absolutely, particularly down the market. Also she was based on two people I saw in the area, as well. One was a bus conductor on a number 38 bus and the other was a woman who served behind a bakery counter. Do they know? No. There will be people out there guessing, is it me? Well, if you or someone in yourfamily guessing, is it me? Well, if you or someone in your family dresses like Pat Butcher then we would love to see the evidence.

Now the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Middlesex has been in the news recently because its top man Rob Hurd has had enough of asking staff to work in sub standard conditions. Our cameras went to look around. Welcome to Britain’s leading hospital for spine and hip problems. Originally built in 1942 to house soldiers during the Second World War, our eye in the sky reveals the hospital still has wards in vintage huts. Something approaching a ski slope between operating theatres and wards, and plenty of fresh air. From the outdoor corridors. This is the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Middlesex and the bosses here say they need to knock it down and start again. Rob Hurd is the hospital’s chief executive. The staff here are heros. They look after the place, we patchit heros. They look after the place, we patch it together. We put sticking plasters on it, but you can see that the conditions are not suitable for modern healthcare. Is it dangerous? Or is itjust an inconvenience? The Care Quality Commission came here, they’re the regulator, they licensed us to be a hospital and they say it’s safe but not fit for purpose. The tour was a bit of an eye-opener. You are putting people in tin sheds? This is over 50 years old. This is patched up, isn’t it? It’s in a terrible state. It’s crumbling. It’s pretty ropey. It’s hard to believe that this is a hospital in the 21st century. That’s until you see the work they do inside. One of the consultant surgeons at the hospital is Dr Alexander. Any surgeon from around the world, if you mention the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital they know where it is. They know the quality and reputation that’s been developed over years. reputation that’s been developed overyears. Does over years. Does that mean when some people come here they’re surprised by what they see? Yes, you could say that, for sure. The reputation is huge and they arrive on this beautiful leafy campus and see the sheds and they’re amazed. What are the dangers if something isn’t done and quickly? We stand to lose one of the most important institutions for muscular care in the country. It would be split up and those years and years of clinical knowledge and experience will be gone. But what do the patients make of it? Mick is a fireman who was left paralysed after a fall. He spent five months at another hospital before coming here. More attention here in a day than I had in months at other places. They’ve got me standing up, which I haven’t done in six months. He is impressed with the care, but has found practical problems. When they cake to you the X-ray you can’t push -- they take to you the X-ray you can’t push yourself because the slope is like that. Is this the famous sloping corridor? Yeah, I thought of Frank Spencer when I saw it, a bed careering down it, it’s like that. Madness. Why isn’t a plan in place?

Tonight, at Ten: Defiance and denial from President Bashar al-Assad as the Syrian conflict enters its fifth year. In a rare interview, he tells the BBC that he cannot be held responsible for the humanitarian crisis that’s engulfed his country. The conflict has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The president denies that his forces are bombing innocent civilians. When you shoot, you aim, and when you aim, you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians. Again, if you are talking about casualty, that is war. You cannot have war without casualty. But the Foreign Office says the Syrian president is either ""deluded or lying."" We’ll have the details. Also tonight: The US confirms the death of an American aid worker, taken hostage by IS in Syria. Her relatives pay this tribute. The world wants to be more like Kayla, and if that is her legacy and the footprint she leaves on the world, that is a wonderful thing. The Premier League breaks all records as Sky and BT pay more than £5 billion for rights to televise live matches. And, the story of what happened to two French babies, accidentally Later on BBC London: Tube drivers vote to go on strike in support of a colleague sacked for failing two alcohol breath tests. And a metal detector enthusiast sees his million pound haul go on display at the British Museum. Good evening. As the Syrian conflict enters its fifth year, President Basharal-Assad, in a rare interview, has told the BBC that he cannot be held responsible for the massive humanitarian crisis in his country. His comments were immediately dismissed by the Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, who said the president was either ""deluded or lying"". The conflict has claimed the lives of at least 200,000 people, while 9 million people have been displaced. The president said it was childish to claim that the Syrian Army had used indiscriminate bombing against its own people. The president’s forces now control the area in green, much of the rest is in the hands of Islamic State extremists and other groups. The president spoke to our Middle East editor, jeremy Bowen. President Assad’s officials promised an interview to the BBC last autumn, but with the Americans starting to bomb Islamic State in Syria, they said events were moving too fast. Mr Assad’s appearance now in a guesthouse at the presidential palace in Damascus is a sign he feels more secure, defending the Syrian armed forces robustly. I have spent time on the front line with soldiers from the Syrian army who insisted they were patriotic, that they were patriots. They weren’t cold-blooded killers, but I have also interviewed people, and so have many otherjournalists and human rights people and so on, who say they have suffered badly at the hands of Syrian soldiers. They cannot all have been lying, surely? How surely? Why are you sure? The weight of testimony. Human Rights Watch for example, 30th ofjanuary this year, said ""forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad have deliberately and viciously attacked civilians in opposition-held areas using indiscriminate weapons, notoriously barrel bombs"". This is a childish story that keeps repeating in the West. Childish? Childish. Why? Again, if somebody is against his people, and the regional power, and the West, and survive how? What about barrel bombs? You don’t deny that your forces use them? I know about the army. They use bullets, missiles and bombs. I have not heard of the army using barrels or maybe cooking pots! Large barrels full of explosives and projectiles which are dropped from helicopters and explode with devastating effect. There has been a lot of testimony about these things. They are called bombs. We have bombs, missiles and bullets. But you would not deny that included under the category of bombs are these barrel bombs, which are indiscriminate weapons? No, there are no indiscriminate weapons. When you shoot, you aim, and when you aim, you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians. Again, if you are talking about casualty, that is war. You cannot have war without casualties. So that is a legitimate use of force? Of course. Including barrel bombs? There are no barrel bombs. We don’t have barrels. Again, it is like talking about cooking pots. We don’t have cooking pots. Like a regular army we have bombs, missiles, bullets and etc. On the fight against Islamic State and Al-Qaeda, the US and others have said you cannot be a partner in that fight. Would you like to be a partner? Partner with who? A partner with the countries attacking Islamic State at the moment. Do you mean the alliance? The jordanians... We don’t want that, for one reason. We cannot be in alliance with a country who support terrorism. Do you talk to the Americans? There are American planes in the air above Syria the whole time. Do you coordinate? No, because they don’t talk to anyone unless he is a puppet. They work above international law. They don’t talk to us, we don’t talk to them. But I am curious that at a time when the American military are in the air above Syria, and your air forces are also in the air above Syria, that there have not been any incidents between the two. No shots seem to have been traded. No planes have been shot down. That suggests to me surely that... That is correct. But again, there is no direct cooperation. Direct - is it via Iraq? That is through more than one party, Iraq and other countries. Sometimes they convey message, a general message, but there is nothing tactical. Is that a continuing dialogue that you have through third parties? There is no dialogue. There is, let’s say, information. They tell you things? Something like this. Do you tell them things? No. And apart from Iraq... When we do something on our territory, we don’t ask anyone, we don’t tell anyone. Syria is in ruins, there are hundreds of thousands of people dead. You have been the commander, you must bear command responsibility for some of that? Yes, according to the constitution and the ethics of yourjob, it is to prevent your country when it is under attack, not to run away, and that is what we have been doing. What keeps you awake at night? What keeps me awake at night? Any reason that could affect any human. Life. Could be personal, could be work. Yourjob? Could be yourjob, could be personal. I am a human. What could any human be affected by? I am affected with the same factors. Have you thought about the casualties and felt or understood the pain of the families of the people wounded and injured or killed? This is something we live in every day, whether they are from opposition, the other side or whether they are supporters. We are human, we live with the casualties, with the death issues on a daily basis. They are family who love their dear ones. I lost members of my family, I lost friends, I lost people I work with. It is something we live every day with in pain. Not long after the interview the Syrian air force was attacking Douma, a rebel held suburb of Damascus. Civilians still live here too, short of food and medical supplies. In the interview the president rejected the UN’s complaint that his government had blocked relief aid to Douma and other besieged areas. The Syrian war is made up of layers of conflict. As a new one is added, ending the killing gets more complicated. jeremy is in Beirut tonight. What were your thoughts on the President’s state of mind and his strategy for the months ahead? He was composed and a lot more confident in real life then he sometimes appears in photographs. He has been accused of being deluded or a liar by the British Foreign Secretary. Certainly what he said about barrel bombs is not backed up by the evidence. There is plenty of evidence they exist, that they are thereon they kill civilians. He won’t be bothered about that because he is also looking to his domestic and getting a message to them, to his supporters, who I think do believe him. As for his state of mind and the future, I think one thing sums it up. In late summer 2013, the Americans gotjust a few hours away from bombing the Assad regime, now the Americans’ hours away from bombing the Assad regime, now the Americans’ military might is turned against Islamic State and that is something which actually does help Bashar al-Assad sleep a lot better at night. Thank you once again. President Obama has repeatedly rejected any alliance with Syria against Islamic State as the coalition’s air strikes continue in the region. The White House confirmed today that an American aid worker- Kayla Mueller- taken hostage in Syria in 2013, has died. She was the the only known remaining American hostage being held by IS, which claimed that she’d been killed in a jordanian air strike. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, reports. Kayla Mueller had gone to Syria to help those affected by the brutal civil war, but like many others she found herself in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and was captured in Aleppo by Islamic State fighters in August 2013. Two years earlier, she’d recorded this video. I am in solidarity with the Syrian people. I reject the brutality and killing that the Syrian authorities are committing against the Syrian people. Last Friday, IS claimed that she’d been killed in a jordanian airstrike. Whether that’s true or not, her family received evidence, over the weekend, that she had died. Today, her parents released the final letter that Kayla had written from captivity. In it she wrote: In confirming’s Kayla’s death, the President has issued a statement saying that the ""US will hunt and bring to justice those responsible no matter how long it takes"". He also said that Islamic State’s abhorrent actions stand in stark contrast to the spirit of people like Kayla. She is somebody who dedicated her life to serving others. And notjust serving other people, but serving those who were in crisis situations, who faced dire circumstances and were relying on the generosity and kindness of fellow human beings to try to meet their needs. In her hometown of Prescott, Arizona, family and friends gathered to pay emotional tributes to Kayla. Kayla’s calling was to help those who you were suffering, whether in her hometown of Prescott, or on the other side of the world. She has done more in her incredible 26 years than many people could ever imagine doing in their lifetime. Kayla was my closest friend, my kindred spirit. I’m going to miss her more deeply than words can express. In Prescott they prayed until the very last moment that this might end in a different outcome, but it wasn’t to be. For the United States, this might be an end to an unhappy chapter. Kayla Mueller was widely understood to be the last US citizen held by Islamic State, though others are still missing in the region. jon Sopel, BBC News Washington. The latest deal for the rights to show live Premier League matches from 2016 has broken all records. Sky and BT Sport will pay more than £5 billion to share the live TV rights for three seasons until 2019. The deal represents a 70% increase on the previous contract, also shared by Sky and BT, and it means that each match is now worth an average of £10.2 million as our sports editor, Dan Roan, explains. E injured. Including the grandmother of Mitzi Steady who remains in a critical condition in hospital. john Kay, It’s action like this that turned English football into one of the hottest properties in world sport. Tonight’s match between Liverpool and Spurs, shown live on BT. But the Premier League’s biggest result of the day came earlier, when the value of its latest television deal was announced. £5.136 billion. Later, the man who had led negotiations for the country’s top clubs told me, even he was taken aback by the scale of the deal. Yeah, I was surprised. Obviously, we were very pleased with. It obviously, the clubs have a product. It’s a product they want to sell. It’s a good dealfor everybody. Good dealfor our sell. It’s a good dealfor everybody. Good deal for our clubs. Sky everybody. Good deal for our clubs. Sky maintains its domination and will show 126 matches season, but had to shell out 80% more than for the current deal. Rivals, BT, meanwhile, paid 18% more for their A2 matches a year. This is businesses making decisions about a much broader set of questions, in the case of BT, it’s about preserving their telephone customers. For Sky it’s about broadband. The staggering growth of value of the Premier League’s TV rights has exceeded all expectations since its formation in 1992. While the boom years have continued, the amount the clubs have given towards grass-roots facilities has decreased in recent years. This record-breaking deal underlines the enduring appeal of the Premier League. Tonight, another sell-out here at the emirates for Arsenal’s match against Leicester City. At a time when ticket price increases continue to outstrip inflation, many fans, up-and-down the country, will hope some of this windfall is passed on to them. I think they are making a lot of money out of the TV deal, which should diminish the percentage the fans should contribute The deal is huge. It seems to go away in transfers. It makes me sick with the wages they play the players and the amount of people who can’t get to theses matches and see them any more. The players who almost earn nearly £300,000 a week, can look forward to another bumper payday. It’s said that football is obscene, is it? Of course not. It’ses market forces. There is a product people want to watch. Keep the stadia full, the first priority. Make sure people want to watch and view. That is where you are seeing the product of that today. English football can now celebrate a deal that means even clubs at the bottom of the Premier League will be among the richest in Europe. As the sports golden age continues, so does the debate over how the spoils should be shared. Dan Roan, BBC News. Police in Bath say a four-year-old girl was among the four people killed when a lorry ran out of control outside a school yesterday. Her grandmother is critically ill. Mitzi Rosanna Steady had been walking with her grandmother when the accident happened. A prayer service has been held for all the victims of the crash and their families, as our correspondent, jon Kay, reports. ""Loved and missed by everyone"", the words of Mitzi Steady’s family tonight as they try to come to terms with their loss. That’s so lovely. All day the little girl’s friends from nursery left messages and prayers close to where the four-year-old was killed by an out of control tipper truck. She was a lovely, sweet little girl. Beautiful. Always very happy. Yeah. The 30 tonne truck that hit Mitzi and her grandmother, as they crossed the road, has now been taken away by investigators. Eyewitnesses said it had come crashing down a steep hill. It also crushed this car, killing the three men inside. The driver of the car was Steven Vaughan from Swansea, 3lI-years-old and recently married. One of his passengers was Phil Allen, a director of the electricity company, Western Power. The people of Bath have turned out in their hundreds for a little girl, known to so many here, and to remember all those killed yesterday afternoon. We’re all devastated. Especially the child. It could have been even worse. The lorry crashed outside a primary school at pick-up time, spilling tonnes of stone and rubble. It stopped literally two foot away. Rob had a narrow escape and he spoke to the lorry driver moments after the crash. Was he able to explain what had happened? He was trying to comprehend. He was just completely in shock. He was saying, he was trying... he said he could see the children on the crossing and he was trying. He was just fighting with his brakes. The the lorry driver will be interviewed by police when he is well enough. Eyewitnesses say he was desperately trying to avert the accident. As well as remembering those who died here, people in this community are also thinking of those who were injured. Including the grandmother of Mitzi Steady, who remains in a critical condition in hospital. john Kay, BBC News, Bath. Any question about Britain’s membership of the European Union should be settled by the end of next year at the latest, according to the British Chambers of Commerce, which says that business will suffer if there’s a period of uncertainty. The call exposed the deep divisions between the political parties, with Labour’s Ed Balls warning that a referendum would undermine economic stability and David Cameron insisting that a referendum was a sensible approach. Our political editor, Nick Robinson, reports. It is a tale of two warnings, warnings to British business of the alleged dire consequences of ending up with the wrong party in Government. Warnings from the Tories and from Labour that if their opponents get in, there will be hell to pay. The venue, the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference. The audience, business leaders, who trooped in to hear first one politician, then another, try to scare them rigid. I warn you not to grow your business because they will come after you. I warn you not to take people on because they will slap taxes on you. If you’re of a certain age, that will sound awfully familiar and it’s meant to - the Tories want to remind you of another former Labour leader who lost an election. If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday, I warn you not to be ordinary. I warn you not to be young. I warn you not to create wealth because they’ll demonise you, because in their vision you are the enemy. Private sector bad, public sector good. The Prime Minister boasted about what his Government had done for them, but chose not to talk about his own policy in Europe, which this organisation’s boss has has warned will create uncertainty, which is bad for business. Should you not be saying to business, ""I warn you, I might not get a better deal in the EU. Iwarn you, I might not get it on the timetable I want, and I warn you that I might take you out of Europe by mistake""? Well, I wouldn’t put it like that for obvious reasons! This organisation does back the idea of a referendum on the EU but say it should be held as soon as possible. They are saying it is quite right to have a strategy that gives Britain the best chance of staying in a reformed European Union that works in our interest. Earlier, the Shadow Chancellor, not, as many noted, his leader, came to reassure that Labour was pro-business. He also came with his own warning about the risks he said were posed by the Tories’ approach to Europe. The threat of leaving the European Union is the biggest risk to British investment and jobs in this decade. Ido not think setting an arbitrary fast timetable is going to help deliver the stability which business needs. Which warning should business take more seriously? The Prime Minister’s, about Labour’s attitude to business? Or the Shadow Chancellor’s, about the Tories putting our membership of the European Union at risk? The truth is, the businessmen and women here are having to learn to live with an enormous amount of political uncertainty. Even some Tory supporters seem unsure what they should fear most. Is he right to say that you should fear Labour? I think I do fear Labour, as a business. Do you fear an EU referendum might take us out of the EU? I don’t want to come out of the European Union. I guess I do fear it. So they are both right, David Cameron and Ed Balls! I guess so! ~ The Prince of Wales has met the new King of Saudi Arabia and raised the case of the jailed blogger, Raif Badawi. The Prince, who is in Riyadh as part of his tour of the Middle East, had been urged by human rights campaigners to highlight the plight of Mr Badawi, who’s been sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for insulting Islam. Our Royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, sent this report. When Royals meet Royals, there’s always a sort of unspoken bond. Stretched a little today in Riyadh by the sheer number of Saudi princes who queued up for a handshake from Prince Charles, but the special Royal to Royal relationship was evident again when Charles sat down with Saudi Arabia’s new King, Salman. It was during these talks that Charles raised the question of Saudi Arabia’s treatment of Raif Badawi, he’s the Saudi citizen who set up an online network to discuss human rights in Saudi Arabia. For that, he was sentenced to 10-years in prison and 1,000 lashes. He received the first 50 of those lashes in public last month. I spoke on the internet to Mr Badawi’s sister, Samar. So what did she hope someone like Prince Charles could do to help her brother? Will Prince Charles’ intervention have any effect? That’s difficult to say because, for all Britain’s concern about human rights here, the reality is that the West needs Saudi Arabia’s support in the struggle against extremism. British diplomats say Saudi Arabia has become an important partner in combatting Islamist extremism rather than being part of the problem which causes that extremism. Principle versus pragmatism. A Prince’s gentle advocacy for a Saudi who dared to challenge his country’s rulers. Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Riyadh. The French courts have awarded two million euros in damages to the families of two French babies who were accidentally switched at birth, 20 years ago. The clinic responsible was ordered to compensate both girls - now young women - their parents and their siblings. The error was discovered a decade ago, but neither family wanted to swap the children. The award was much less than the families had claimed, as our correspondent, Lucy Williamson, reports. £500,000 for raising the wrong daughter. Sophie Serrano spotted the signs just days after Manon was born. The baby she’d given birth to was put into an incubator to recover from jaundice. The one she was given back had small differences in her hair and skin. TRANSLATION: After four days they brought me a baby and I was taken aback because she had more hair. So I asked what was going on. I couldn’t possibly imagine what had actually happened, but it was odd, so I mentioned it, and the nurse answered that it was the UV rays that had made her hair grow more quickly than normal. As Manon grew, so did the evidence that she was someone else’s child. After years of localjibes that she was the postman’s daughter, Manon’s parents took a DNA test - the result was devastating. TRANSLATION: I was thinking, if I’m not her mother, then the daughter I gave birth to must be in another family somewhere. So I was afraid. Was she OK? Was she being looked after? Was she alive? I was petrified. For Manon, it was a question of gaining a family, but losing an identity. TRANSLATION: I found myself with two mothers, two fathers, several brothers and sisters. I couldn’t work out where I belonged because there was my mother, but she wasn’t my birth mother. Here in France tonight, there’s a sense of horror that this mistake went undetected for so long. Both families have tried to stay in contact, but ""it was too difficult"", one mother said, ""too distressing."" This legal ruling is now the onlyjustice they’ll see for a wrong that will never be put right. But, said Manon, the verdict mattered ""it feels good"" she said ""that this is over. Free, after so many years, to look to the future."" Left with the grief and the relief of knowing who she really is. Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris. Newsnight is on BBC Two.

It’s like a war in here. It does look, um... Disgusting? Yeah! It’s very tense! Yes! A furious exchange in Parliament between the prime minister and the labour leader about tax dodging and swiss bank accounts.

Tonight on BBC London: Borisjohnson meets Hillary Clinton on the latest stage of his trip to America. And London Councils call for more money to help integrate social services and the NHS in the capital to stop bed-blocking. Good evening. The Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron in Parliament of being ""a dodgy Prime Minister with dodgy donors"" - after a list of HSBC clients with private accounts in Switzerland was published. The names included Conservative and Labour donors - although there’s no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of them. It follows revelations earlier this week that HSBC had encouraged tax evasion among some of its UK customers. Mr Cameron said Labour had done nothing about tax dodging Our Political Editor Nick Robinson reports What secrets have live remained in the vaults of HSBC? Today we learned that many of those rich enough to fund our political parties were rich enough, too, to keep some of their money here. A narrow go, we learn the HSP tax avoidance candle, were seven Tory donors including the former treasurer. Ash HSBC tax avoidance candle. How can the Prime Minister explain the revolving door between Tory party HQ, and the Swiss branch of HSBC? This week the BBC panorama revealed HSBC had advised some of their clients in Switzerland how to illegally evade tax. But it’s not illegal to have a Swiss bank account and many of those whose names were leaked were not using them to avoid tax. That did not deter Ed Miliband. He cannot get away from it, he’s a dodgy Prime Minister surmounted by dodgy donors. He claimed the Prime Minister was bang to rights and up to his neck, even by the standards of the Commons it’s pretty strong stuff. MPs can say things in the Commons which they often wouldn’t dare to say outside. Ed Miliband singled out one Tory donor, who now says if the allegations made outside, the Labour leader will end UP outside, the Labour leader will end up in court. The man in question is Lord Fink who’s given the Tories £3 million, he was made a peer and party treasurer by David Cameron. Tonight he wrote to Ed Miliband to say, this allegation is untrue and defamatory, I challenge you to repeat your allegation outside the House of Commons or to withdraw it publicly. The Prime Minister was keen to point out that there was not just Tory donors whose names were published today. I saw this list before becoming the leek coming to prime ministers questions and one of those named -- prime ministers questions and one of those named -- I saw this list before coming to prime Mr ‘s questions. I am clear, before coming to prime Mr ‘s questions. Iam clear, people questions. I am clear, people should PGY questions. I am clear, people should pay taxes and no government has been tougher than this one in chasing down tax evasion and tax avoidance. The arguments do not stop there, there are still questions about why this man, head of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a peer and a Trade Minister. David Cameron says he took all of the advice available, but refuses to say if he’s ever asked Lord Green about tax avoidance. The revenue, or those we used to call the tax men are also under fire for not doing enough to catch tax dodgers or get enough cash from them. They insist the criticism is simply unfairand from them. They insist the criticism is simply unfair and based upon simplistic media reporting, today angry MPs complained those evading tax based incredibly low risks. The worst that can happen to you, if HMRC can be bothered to catch up with you is that you might have to PaYÂ with you is that you might have to pay, you won’t have a prosecution, you won’t have any shame, you won’t be an example, you will get away with it. It’s a terrible message to give out to British taxpayers. Amidst the noise, some substance to night, the revenue is looking to expand the scope of the investigation into HSBC, meeting other law enforcement agencies later in the week. We just heard Nick saying that HMRC is expanding the scope, what can you tell us? My sources tell me the jenny Grainger, the head of compliance at HMRC will meet the Serious Fraud Office, and the police, later this week. To look at expanding possibly this investigation. That would be a serious escalation for HSBC, we saw in the report there, that the clashes between Margaret Hodge, and Lin Homer, the Chief Executive of HMRC, over whether they had done enough, to act over the HSBC allegations, and Lin Homer said they had done more actually, than other countries, she said only two countries in the world had led prosecutions over the matter. Britain, with one successful prosecution, and Ireland. What will matter today is what will HSBC, HMRC be able to share with the S FO and the police, and will be SFO and the police take forward investigations, if they do it makes the matter more serious HSBC. Thousands of NHS staff have been bullied and intimidated by senior colleagues after raising concerns about patient care - according to an official inquiry. It’s the second report to call for greater protection for whistleblowers. The first, by the same author Sir Robert Francis, followed the scandal at Mid-Staffs hospital. But two years on, he’s concluded whistleblowers are still subjected to shocking treatment. The government has pledged to fast track new laws to protect them. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym has more. avoidable deaths, inhumane treatment of patients and staff too scared to speak out, yet two years on from the official report on the hospital, the author says there’s still a problem in the NHS because whistle-blowers are afraid to come forward. They have been bullied. In some cases they have lost theirjobs. In one such case somebody told me about wanting to commit suicide. Nobody who raises concern, nobody who goes to work to help patients should end UP to work to help patients should end up in those sort of situations. Sir Robert emphasises staff can feel isolated and cut off from colleagues if they’d been badly treated. His report recommends local support for whistle-blowers at hospitals with a so-called guardian appointed to advise staff who want to speak out. It would be backed by a national independent officer, and there would be a new support scheme to help NHS whistle-blowers getting back into work. Doctor Kim Holt exposed serious failings in children’s health clinic, she was suspended and eventually reinstated but the whole process took a toll. It was awful, I was depressed and shocked and scared. It kept me awake at night, I used to be waking up in the night and reading my e-mails. Not able to sleep. It occupied pretty much most of my daytime thinking. The Health Secretaryjeremy Hunt said he backed the proposals and would legislate to protect whistle-blowers from job discrimination, neighbour macro said the measures should go further to cover care homes. -- the measures should go further to cover care homes. -- Labour said. This doctor has spent 13 years in a battle with his employers after he raised concerns about safety, he won his case at a tribunal that fears he will never work again. After hearing today’s announcement at Westminster he told me Sir Robert Francis had not done enough to protect whistle-blowers. I could not at all support or encourage anybody to put their life and their career at risk for patient safety, because inevitably they are going to continue as they do at this very moment to be persecuted and victimised because there is not those protections in place working to protect whistle-blowers. Even after the review? Even at this moment. Sir Robert acknowledged changing the rules is one thing but what is really needed for the NHS is a change of culture. About 300 people are missing and feared dead after a number of boats carrying migrants sank in the Mediterranean. The United Nations refugee agency said three inflatable rafts disappeared after setting off from Libya. Officials said a handful of people had been rescued from the water. The Ukrainian and Russian presidents along with other European leaders are meeting to try to agree a ceasefire for Ukraine’s10 month long conflict. In the build up to the talks, the fighting in eastern Ukraine has intensified and casualties dramatically increased as both sides try to consolidate their positions. The war has left more than 5,500 people dead according to the Ukrainian government. 24 soldiers and civilians have been killed in the last 24 hours alone. At least a million people have been forced to flee destroyed homes and towns. Our Correspondent Ian Pannell reports from the rebel held town of Donetsk. Ukraine’s at war with itself. Its people bear the brunt of a brutal conflict about identity and sovereignty and this is what’s become of parts of its industrial heartland. Desolate. Destroyed. Both sides they they’re defending their territory. But invariably their shells slam into civilian areas with devastating results. More than 5,000 have been killed and a million and a half uprooted. These are the rebels - pro-Russian and battling government plans to join the EU. What these men fighting for is nothing less than than the creation of a new state here in eastern Ukraine. The more blood that’s been spilt, the more entrenched the positions become. Both sides now have a very different vision of the future and without a political resolution, they’re willing to enforce that through massive fire power. EXPLOSIONS Russia’s accused of sending troops and armour to help the rebels o’ ~ -- and allegation that Moscow denies. But there are shared visions for the future of eastern Ukraine. TRANSLATION: In the beginning we didn’t want to be separate, we just wanted more autonomy. But after everything the Ukrainian army has done us to, We will create a separate state. But the people are paying heavily for this war, in a subterranean shantytown pensioners hide from the artillery shells overhead. These women have been living here the seven months, the government has bombed their homes and cut off their pensions. So they hide here with their pets, no means of escape. TRANSLATION: Our pensions aren’t being paid. Could they at least give us our pensions? So we can go and buy something to eat? What can we hope for? We seem to be somehow erased from some list and we are... Nowhere. The only ones who dare patrol the streets above are the young men of the rebel army. This crisis is escalating an at alarming rate and if peace talks fail again, this war on Europe’s eastern flanks risks spiralling out of control. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is calling for an end to austerity and for the deficit to be reduced at a slower pace after the next election. The Scottish National party leader also says her party wants to increase UK public spending by £180 billion by 2020. Her comments come as opinion polls suggest the SNP could hold the balance of power at Westminster after the general election. Carole Walker has the story. APPLAUSE Scotland’s First Minister came to London and delivered a damning verdict on the economic policies of the three main Westminster parties. Austerity she said, had failed to reduce the deficit and caused anxiety and misery for some of the most vulnerable citizens. We simply don’t accept that there has to be a trade-off between balancing the books and having a balanced society. Fairness and prosperity can go hand-in-hand, infact Fairness and prosperity can go hand-in-hand, in fact I would put it more strongly than that, fairness and prosperity must go hand-in-hand. Under the SNP plans public spending would rise by half a percent per year. Providing £180 billion more than under the government plans over the next four years. But it would mean the deficit, the gap between what the country earns and spends would still be 2% of the nation ‘s wealth at the end of the Parliament. The polls suggest that the SNP could hold the balance of power here, after the coming election. The parties already said it will not P""ÂP UP parties already said it will not prop up the Conservative government, now Nicola Sturgeon has made it much clearer what the price would be the supporting Labour, it would mean more to spend on public services but higher debt at the end of the Parliament. Is that a price Labour would be prepared to pay if it came to coalition negotiations? We’re not planning or expecting a coalition the SNP. You need to get rid of the Tory government and only the Labour Party is big enough and strong enough to defeat David Cameron and the Tories. In Scotland the danger is if you vote SNP, you run the risk of making sure David Cameron stays in power by accident. We know the price the SNP would exact, unhinge an 80 million -- We know the price the SNP would exact, unhinge an 80 million --100 £80 billion of borrowing. The SNP policies have proved pretty popular in Scotland and they are on course to make big gains from Labour at the election which could put the Scottish Nationalists in a strong position to press for an end to austerity across the whole of the UK.

Scientists are hailing this as an unprecedented time of progress in the fight against cancer. Survival rates have already doubled in the past Ao years. That’s set to improve further with a new generation of targeted drug treatments which are the result of huge advances in the understanding of the faulty genes which drive cancer growth. The treatments tend to have fewer side-effects than conventional chemotherapy, and in some cases may cure more cancers. The BBC’s Panorama programme has spent 18 months following a group of patients, including one young girl, Sophie Armitage, who has a rare childhood cancer. Our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh reports. Being diagnosed with cancer at any age is a shock but imagine it it happening when you are just nine. Sophie Armitage had a rare and aggressive tumour surrounding her airway. Two years ago, doctors thought one of her lungs might need to be removed. Instead, she went on a drug trial and the effects were immediate. It happening when you are just nine. Sophie Armitage had a rare and aggressive tumour surrounding her airway. Two years ago, doctors thought one of her lungs might need to be removed. Instead, she went on a drug trial and the effects were immediate. It’s plum size and it was down to not much bigger than a hazelnut. There is not a massive lump in my longer any more. A gene had triggered her cancer. This is one of many drug treatments being tested by the Royal Marsden and the Institute of Cancer research. It is the goal of every paediatric oncologist to see that kind of response. It is truly miraculous to see and we told her in the clinic that she is unique. The key to this new generation of drugs is greater understanding of human genetics. A revolution in DNA sequencing has meant that we can map the disease faster, cheaper and in greater detail than ever. Cancer is caused when genes in healthy cells mutate leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Conventional drug chemotherapy kills rapidly dividing cancer cells and damages healthy tissue. These drugs work differently. They are designed to block changes within the cancer cells which drive tumour growth. By targeting them, cancer cells cannot function and die. For Sophie, the side-effects have been minimal and she can take her pills on the beach with a spoon of yoghurt. Has it spurred you want to think about what you are going to do later in life? I have always wanted to be a doctor. Now I have been through all of this, I want to be a doctor in the more. Sophie’s drug is not yet licensed here but is showing promise in trials for adult lung cancer. These new treatments are expensive but for Sophie they offer hope of a future without cancer. And you can see Panorama’s ""Can you cure my cancer?"" at 9.00pm tonight on BBC1 and after that on the BBC’s iPlayer. Essex Police is being investigated for the way it’s handled dozens of allegations of child abuse, including rape. The Independent Police Complaints Commission will review the cases, which are thought to involve nearly sixty victims. One officer has been suspended - and another 11 have been placed on restricted duties. Sian Lloyd is at Essex Police Headquarters in Chelmsford. Talking about nearly 60 victims. What can you tell others? This investigation centres on the work of one unit, Essex Police’s child abuse investigation team which covers the north of the county and the work of some officers in that unit who have to deal with complex and difficult cases and vulnerable victims. It has emerged that the Essex force has referred 30 cases to the independent police complaints commission. They are looking at possible failings to safeguard children and arrest subjects and how matters were referred to the CPS. Very dangerous and serious allegations relating to 59 victims. The force has apologised and wants to reassure victims that any officer who is found to be failing will be held to account. Teenagers in some parts of England are missing out on going to top universities and choosing careers in areas like medicine, because of the limited numbers of GCSEs on offer in their schools. New research has found that schools in wealthier areas are more likely to offer a wide range of subjects - while poorer areas miss out on science and languages. Our Education Correspondent Alex Forsyth reports. What you learn at school depends on where you live in England according to research. It claims children in poorer areas are offered a less challenging curriculum than those in wealthy neighbourhoods affecting their life chances. Take Hammersmith and Fulham, here at Phoenix School, children routinely study three separate sciences, crucial to those wanting a career in medicine. A lot of universities take science as a requirement. It is a big subject, it would be disappointing not to have that opportunity. The research shows access to such opportunities is mixed. Children in Kingston-upon-Hull are far less likely to take an art GCSE than those in the Isles of Scilly. In Kensington they are four times as likely to study language as those in Middlesbrough. Every school in Sussex and Cumbria offer triple science but a third in Knowsley don’t. Though this school is bucking the trend. Students here can take triple science for the first time this year. That is vital for Lewis, an aspiring Astro physicist. I thought it was a good academic subject because I wanted to have a career in science. The school wants to test all students in all areas. We need high aspiration if the children showed talent. In the past, children have not been able to show you if they are talented if the curriculum does not stretch and push, particularly in the sciences. That is what we are doing here. Schools in some deprived neighbourhoods have avoided challenging subjects because they didn’t expect children to do well and didn’t want to damage their position in the league table. The government has changed the table to focus on core academic scum objects. It says more jordan now taking them and every child should have access to rigorous qualifications where ever they are. From today, driverless cars are being tested in England. The government is spending 19 million pounds on developing the new technology. Three different vehicles are involved in the trials in south London, Milton Keynes, Coventry and Bristol. Our Transport Correspondent Richard Westcott has been for a ride in one car. We let a computer take charge of this though people worry if a computer is taking charge of one of these. This is the first look at the driverless cars that will be weaving amongst the station and the shops in Milton Keynes Dons. 90% of accidents have human error involved. Understanding the obstacles is the primary benefit of understanding this kind of technology. The government is putting £19 million into driverless technology. They are launching schemes in Bristol, Milton schemes and turning heads in south London. This is the card they are testing here in Greenwich. It is not remote control, it is purely driven by a computer, using lasers. You turn up, you register on a website, you can call it up and take it on a local journey. What happens if somebody does this? Luckily, it stops. It is claimed that robot cars will save lives, cut pollution and keep people mobile. For disabled folks around the country who might not be able to drive in future, it represents a major Advanta in independent travel. Everybody is going to need convincing. You would be happier if somebody was operating it. Knowing that nobody is diving it is a bit blue. It will be many years before you can go into a showroom and buy your first robotic car. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Alex Deacon. For most places, the cloud sticks around, not doing a great deal. Patchy rain spreading into northern and western isles. Fog patches clearing in the South and where temperatures will drop to freezing but more like plus three or four when we have got the cloud, for most of ours. It will be here tomorrow. A rather drab affair. Some light and patchy rain. Again, that north-eastern corner of Scotland patchy. For most of us, it is simply a grey February day and a pretty cold one, as well. Temperatures for five Celsius. It will be a struggle without the sunshine to help. The winds will pick up tomorrow evening. An area of low pressure is approaching. Ice bars squeezing together. This weather front arriving to bringing a band of rain. Ahead of it, some showers, heavy snow for a time over the Grampians. We will see more showers and also a bit of sunshine. It will be a bit milder and it will stay milder into the weekend. It will also stay predominantly cloudy but dry.

Lots more to come, including: The businesses fearing for their future as Brixton’s railway is renovated. Councils in London say they will not be able to help move elderly people out of hospital and back home without more funding. It comes as the NHS tries to free up beds for patients who need them most. Health ministers want better care in the community but London councils argue more money is needed to achieve that. With so many people going through the doors of A&E, the challenge for councils and the NHS across London is making sure they are not always admitted to a ward and better unless it is entirely necessary. Here at new, they have come up with a project to try and make that happen, particularly where the are involved -- Newham. This social worker, having assessed the patient, it is herjob to find them care and interim accommodation so they can leave hospital as soon as possible. We try to work with them to allay their fears and support their need to reassure them they can still be managed at home. Comfort’s team found George Morgan a flat in sheltered housing in Stratford. He is still fairly independent but someone cooks his meals and carers are on hand. Are you pleased you are here and not in hospital? Yes, I am, Are you pleased you are here and not in hospital? Yes, Iam, because in hospital? Yes, I am, because I am quite happy here at the moment. It is only a day since I am here and I am feeling quite homely. But all of this social care costs councils money. The Government gave the capital and extra £7 million to help over the winter. In Newham, capital and extra £7 million to help overthe winter. In Newham, it over the winter. In Newham, it has paid for more social workers seven days a week and funded trial partnership with Age UK but London councils say they are a funding shortfall of £1.1lI billion for adult social care over the next five years, so something will have to give. We have been able to put in place and projects that are currently short term. If we had more funding, we would be able to make those projects sustainable over the longer term. those projects sustainable over the longerterm. So longer term. So we can maintain the level of performance we have been able to achieve. The Government has initiated a big change with the Better Care Fund, which pools resources between the NHS and local authorities, with 5-3p of money brought together from April of this year-- 5-.3 billion. That is the biggest shift away ever of resources from repairing of the spectrum to better intervention of ill-health. No pledge of new money then. In these cash-strapped times, it seems it will be up to local ambition and reallocated funding to help take the pressure off our hospitals. More now on the apology from Essex Police, after it’s emerged that investigations into alleged child abuse had been mishandled over several years. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake is here to tell us more. The number of cases is quite alarming, isn’t it? One of-- most of this focuses on the child protection team in the north of Essex but now other parts of the county are being looked at. To recap, Essex Police have apologised to nearly 60 alleged victims of child abuse, after a senior officer found problems with 30 different investigations. They are now being looked at by the IPCC hum of the police watchdog, and they will be looking at whether officers failed to arrest suspects, also whether they didn’t properly safeguard victims, and also whether, in one case, an officerfraudulently victims, and also whether, in one case, an officer fraudulently signed a statement on behalf of a victims. And some of these victims were extremely young indeed. One case, we believe, involved a 5 year old girl, who was raped by a I2-year-old boy. He received what is called a final warning, so that is one of the cases being looked at. Earlier today, a senior officer from the force explained how they had been keeping in victims -- victims informed of what has been going on. I have written to each of the victims and they will have received those letters in the last couple of days and they have also had visits from our officers to back up what it contains in that letter. I have explained what is happening and I have also apologised for any hurt or distress that the contents of my letter and the news it contains may have caused. So, what has happened to the officers? It has emerged that half of the members of this unit are under investigation. One officer has been suspended, II others have been moved out of the unit for now. And we understand at least five of them are under investigation for gross misconduct. If that is proved, it would mean dismissalfrom misconduct. If that is proved, it would mean dismissal from the force. Essex Police are saying that a former senior detective has been brought back in to the unit and is now looking at all of the live investigations at the moment, so they are trying to give words of reassurance in that way, bringing in more staff, but certainly the nature and the scale of these problems is worrying. Nick, thanks very much. Two strikes planned by London bus drivers have been postponed. Drivers were set to walk out on Friday and next Monday, in protest over the way pay differs across the city’s 18 bus companies. Transport for London says it welcomes the news. Drivers held a 28-hour strike last week over the same disagreement.

The character of Brixton will be lost forever if plans to renovate its distinctive railway arches go ahead as planned later this year. That’s according to dozens of businesses - some stretching back generations - where traders have served their customers beneath the rumble of passing trains. But as Sarah Harris reports, Network Rail says the modernisation is essential. People from all over the country have been coming to the daily under the arches on Atlantic Road in Brixton for as long as anyone can remember. The Viking delicacy of salted cod is a particular favourite. But sometime in the next year, pose a will have do leave this second-generation business for up to a year while motivations are carried out. It is unlikely he will be able to come back. There is no real offer to return. The offer on the table is essentially the worst-case scenario for a small business. The compensation they are offering is laughable in terms of being able to set up somewhere else. No property will be found for us to move into nearby, where our customers are. It is likely more than 20 businesses will be affected by the face lift carried out by Network Rail, which owns the units. It will cost more than £5 billion but some residents say it will ruin Brixton forever. I have been a Brixton resident for 24 years. This is notjust a bit of local character, this is the heart of Brixton, it is what makes Brixton what it is. And while there have been changes in the area with new businesses coming in, it needs to have a community and Network Rail comes in and just tries to get the best rented can on these arches, we will see a bunch of upmarket businesses which price out the local community. Network Rail say it is to keep character there and support will be given to keep businesses going. We will have a spread of rents, some will be more expensive, some less expensive, and we are working with Lambert to make sure there are some GP start-ups, so we can ensure the vibrancy of the business in the area. There will be a meeting at Lambeth town Hall later this month, but many traders here feel this will be their last year in a place like no other. Still to come: Why Leyton Orient are the unlikely subject for a reality television show in Italy. And the film stars rallying round to save Turner’s Twickenham home. Labour has defended its decision to use a pink minibus to encourage more women to vote. The bus will tour the country in the run up to the general election and made a start in Stevenage this morning, with Deputy Leader Harriet Harman on board. But some have called the effort patronising. Our Political Editor Tim Donovan is at Westminster now. This was the launch of Labour’s woman to woman campaign and this was the mode of transport chosen to very leading Labourfront the mode of transport chosen to very leading Labour front bench the country over the next few weeks, 270 constituencies in all, a pink minibus, or magenta, to be exact. It is Labour’s idea to try and connect more women and in particular get more women to vote. According to a recent survey, 55% of women only say they will vote in the next election, and there are 9 million who didn’t vote in 2010. The point about it is not so much the colour but what it stands for and it is going to go all around the country and it is a focal point for us Labour women to be talking to and listening to other women as to why there is so much disaffection amongst women and why so many, 9 million at the last General Election, thought it wasn’t worth voting. All day, there has been quite a reaction, a fair amount of mockery on social media in particular. Harriet Harman was challenged about whether it was right to exclude men from these conversations. Should they be women only conversations? There was a conversation about the colour pink being patronising itself. A Conservative MP suggested it at Prime Minister’s Questions today and he reacted with this joke. I Prime Minister’s Questions today and he reacted with thisjoke. I have he reacted with this joke. I have to say, Labour’s campaign, I would say the wheels are falling off the wagon, but I feel the wheels are falling off the bus. We know it is not going to be driven by anyone on the front bench. Surprise, surprise, it is going to be driven by And unite. So a fair amount of mockery but crucially, people are talking about this and this bus is coming to London next week, so if you are in Croydon, look out. Tim Donovan, thank you very much. They’re not exactly giants of European football, so it might surprise some that Leyton Orient are the subject of a reality TV show in Italy. Orient’s owner says the programme will help them find new players and boost their profile. But with the club experiencing its worst season for a decade, fans are unconvinced, as Chris Slegg reports. Prime-time Thursday nights national TV in Italy. The Leyton Orient show. The man who owns the TV channel is the man who owns Leyton Orient. Francesco bought the club last summer. He has not said much to the British media since that day, but he agreed to talk to us about his TV show. TRANSLATION: It is a great success, especially for the amount of people watching Leyton Orient. People are talking about Leyton Orient, the talent show and the opportunity to give younger talents to come to London to experience both the city and British football. The show follows young Italian footballers competing to win a professional contract at Leyton Orient. They train at the Orient training ground and play trial matches on their pitch. Do you worry that maybe this has distracted from the season and maybe one of the reasons why the club are struggling so much? TRANSLATION: I think it is wrong to think that even if they are the bottom team now, there is something wrong with them. I think the reason they are going not so well is because we are setting a new era and I think with all investment, when you start something new, you have to wait a little bit of time. Away from reality shows, this is Leyton Orient’s reality right now. Another defeat last night left them rock bottom of League 1 and leaving some fans questioning whether the TV channel is their own’s priority. As results have got worse, it is something people have latched onto, something that sums up where we are going wrong. Using the phrase like ""this is a circus"". Ido think it is a sideshow. If we were doing well in the league, I don’t think people would have a problem with it. Whatever happens in the TV show, there is plenty of work to do to make sure a professional contract at Leyton Orient is a prize worth competing for. He’s one of the most celebrated artists this country has ever produced, but the home ofjW Turner- Sandycombe Lodge - is in a state of disrepair, and may not be saved unless donations can be raised to preserve it. Director Mike Leigh and the cast of the film Mr Turner have appealed for funding to restore the building in Twickenham, in the hope that it could be opened to the public next year. Chris Rogers has the story. Turner, one of Britain’s’s greatest painters, designed and built Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham in 1813. Then, it was surrounded by countryside and views of the River Thames. After more than 200 years, his country retreat is surrounded by development outside, while the toll of damp and neglect inside would appal the artist if he were to see it now. and neglect inside would appall the artist if he were to see it now. The Turner Trust has received a £1.lI million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to bring the house back to its former glory, but another £270,000 is still needed. The cast of the biographical film ofj.M.W. Turner hope they could help to protect the artist’s decaying Twickenham villa. Director Mike Leigh first came to Turner’s only surviving residence with the cast for inspiration for filming. Today, they have returned to appeal for donations. So you don’t just see this as a house where somebody important lived, you see this as a work of art? Well, it is a work of art. It is a quirky work of art. I mean, Turner wasn’t an architect but he aspired to being one. He designed the house himself and, of course, it is an eccentric, rather wonderful for it, very little house. I think the first thing that Turner would be shocked by is the fact it is surrounded by houses, there was no view. I play his father, who, who really run this place, who really ran this place, looked after it, was a housekeeper, did the garden, cooked here. To have this... To be actually where they lived is an extraordinary starting point for our work. This be my chamber. I play Mrs Booth, who Turner meets a lot later in life, but I wanted to come just to see it, and I could feel the atmosphere. It is sort of goose bumps time, really, for me. I playjohn Soane, and the implication was that whilst he didn’t design the has, he would have had quite a large influence and didn’t design the house, he would have had quite a large influence and Turner, they were friends, and I would imagine he would have said, ""I was thinking of doing this,"" and, ""What do you think of that?"" Pending more donations, from next year, the public will be able to literally walk inside the work of one of the world’s leading artists. In the lead-up to the General Election, the Southbank Centre is hosting a festival to celebrate the story of post war Britain. As part of the schedule, the Hayward Gallery has commissioned seven artists to curate a show exploring a range of themes that look at the last 70 years of British history. From feminism and political protest to the economy and Arts Correspondent Brenda Emmanus reports on the exhibtion - History is Now. A decommissioned missile launcher has landed on the terraces of the Southbank Centre. Drawing the eye to the Hayward Gallery, where their latest show explores 70 years of British history. Richard Wentworth is one of seven artists curating sections of this new project. This striking weapon representing the Cold War. Inside the gallery space, the artists present over 250 objects from public and private collections, a meditation on modern Britain - from post-Thatcherite society and protest movements, to mad cow disease and celebrity culture. Artists have imaginativ ways of looking at the world and as an Artists have imaginative ways of looking at the world and as an art gallery, as an institution, part of the idea of inviting artists it is to really embrace their creative perspectives and the way they have an ability to find and put things together in a creative and imaginative way. While Roger Hiorns reflects on mad cow disease and biomedical research and health care, artist john Akomfrah presents experimental films by and about artists, ranging from Barbara Hepworth, Gilbert and George and Francis Bacon. A cross-section of issues and events forms Simon Fujiwara’s reflection on contemporary Britain. The first object I selected was the brooms from the London riots, and seeing that the kind of overwhelming symbol of positivity were the images of these brooms held aloft with a group of people that had come to clean up after the London riots, but at the same time this troubling idea that you can clean away a social problem. Photography is Hannah Starkey’s profession and passion. In her curated space, she challenges us to be mindful of its positive and toxic influence on identity and gender. What I would really like to see is the consumer taking back that control of our image and our relationship with the visual and photography and beauty. You know, consumer power is the ultimate power. We think we are powerless and objectification in advertising has been going on for years, but the truth is we are not powerless. In the run-up to the General Election, the show invites us to think about how we have got to where we are today and how this determines our present and future lives. Time for a check on the weather now with Helen, who is here. It has been cold, any change on the way? It will probably still feel cold, even though we are not suffering as many frosts as we have, the cloud is making it chilly. The weather script hasn’t changed for the last couple of days because of the cloud and you can see the extent across the UK today. The south-east is down here, only the far north and east had any sunshine and the cloud is reluctant to clear. There is the possibility it might thin overnight and if it does, we might see a little bit of Frost and some pockets of fog, but it is more likely we will have the cloud we have at the moment, perhaps a little bit of hill fog. Temperatures are close enough to freezing, so it is still chilly. We get off to a chilly and grey start tomorrow morning, a bit of Mr Rand, potentially over the hills, but it should Brighton -- missed around. Like today, but unlikely to be more than limited brightness, temperatures about five or 6 degrees, but then we do change the weather script as low pressure comes in to bring us our first significant rain for some time. You can see the lines are tight, the isobars, so some wind will push the rain through. Friday starts off in a decent way, dry and cloudy, but we get a dribs and drabs of rain and into the afternoon, potentially a spell of a few hours of heavy rain and stronger winds. But it is not cold, the wind is not coming from the cold direction. We might reach double figures but it won’t feel pleasant because of the window and the rain. What happens afterwards is the likelihood of the rain clearing away through the first half of Saturday. So after that, we return to what we have at the moment, often cloudy and dry weather, a little milder by the weekend. Hopefully mainly dry. So another cloudy day tomorrow, rain on Friday and hopefully some fairly usable weather this weekend. Let’s hope so. The main news headlines now. The names have emerged on senior political figures and donors who have held Swiss bank accounts with HSBC. The bank is at the centre of a row over tax advice, but there is no suggestion of wrongdoing linked to these latest revelations.

Good evening. A court in Italy has tonight sentenced the captain of the cruise liner Costa Concordia to 16 years in jail for multiple counts of manslaughter. Francesco Schettino was in charge when the vessel hit rocks and capsized off the island of Giglio in 2012, with the loss of 32 lives. He was accused of taking the liner too close to the shore and then abandoning ship, with passengers and crew still on board. Schettino denied the charges and said he was being made a scapegoat. Live to the court in Grosseto this evening, and our correspondent Matthew Price. This extraordinary year and a half long trial was held in the town’s local theatre. They decided that so great was the media interest and so large number of witnesses, the local courthouse was not big enough. It has been a very complex case, but possibly one whose outcome was never in doubt. A reckless idiot is how Captain Francesco ‘s Coutinho was described by prosecutors. -- Francesco ‘s Coutinho was described by prosecutors. -- Francesco Schettino. He made a last appeal this morning, breaking down in tears, saying he had been made a scapegoat, that others were also to blame. But hours later, as the judges arrived to deliver their decision, the man dubs Capitan Powered was nowhere to be seen. He didn’t have too appear for the verdict. -- didn’t have too appear for the verdict. -- the man dubbed Captain Khaled. Guilty of multiple manslaughter and causing a shipwreck, 16 years injail. This was the result of the recklessness. He ordered the ship to sail off calls close to Giglio island. A twisting, gaping wound tore into Woodside. Bishop’s charts were not detailed enough to show the rocks it hit. -- detailed enough to show the rocks it hit. -- the ship’s charts. Confused passengers and crew waited for instructions. The captain dithered, delaying the order to abandon ship. But it was not under control. The court heard that while hundreds queued up, making their way down the side of the ship, Francesco Schettino was already on land, found guilty today of abandoning ship. A call with the coastguard at the time made this clear. The Costa cruise ship company, which has already spent £2 billion on salvaging the Costa Concordia, was also blamed. Thejudges held it partially responsible tonight and ordered it to pay more damages to the survivors. As for Giglio, this is the scene today. The Costa Concordia has been towed away and the last salvage platforms will vanish soon. And in this traditional, tranquilfishing village, the only reminder is the plaque on the sea wall bearing the names of the 32 people who died in these waters. Before the verdict was announced today, I managed to speak to Francesco Schettino behind the closed doors of the court and asked whether he felt the process was fair. He sounded pretty good indeed. He has the right to appeal. We think it is likely that he will, and under the rules of Italian justice, he it is likely that he will, and under the rules of Italianjustice, he may well actually not yet go to prison. He could be allowed to remain free or at least under house arrest while any appeals process continued. If thatis any appeals process continued. If that is the case, I would have thought that all of the survivors and the relatives of those victims killed by Francesco Schettino’s actions would be very unhappy indeed. The UK tax authorities are set to expand the scope of their inquiry into HSBC’s business in Switzerland, and they’re likely to hold talks with police and the Serious Fraud Office next week. It follows allegations that HSBC may have helped wealthy clients to avoid or evade tax. But the head of HM Revenue & Customs has rejected claims that she should have done more to act on information about HSBC’s activities. News that both Conservative and Labour donors had held Swiss bank accounts with HSBC prompted some ferocious exchanges in the Commons, as our political editor Nick Robinson reports. What secrets have lain hidden in the vaults of HSBC’s Swiss banking arm? The revenue announced it was widening its investigation into once private accounts which are being made public. It was a response to criticism from angry MPs, who said those who dodged tax based incredibly low risks. The worst that can happen, if HMRC can be bothered to catch up with you, is you may have to pay, you won’t have a prosecution, you won’t be an example to anybody, you will get away with it. That is a terrible message to give out to British taxpayers, really rotten. It is not correct. Again and again, the chief executive of the Revenue defended her actions in pursuing tax cheats. I don’t believe there is any lost tax in this, I have said that repeatedly. We have been effective in getting the tax that we should, it is good for the country and has been done very well. More than 3500 UK citizens were revealed as having secret HSBC Swiss bank accounts. It is not illegal and only one third of them were said to have roads tax. But when it emerged that significant Tory donors were on the list, it was too good a target for Labour. We learned that link to the tax avoidance scandal are several Tory donors, including a former treasurer of the Tory party, who between them have given more than £5 million to the Conservative party. How can the Prime Minister explain the revolving door between Tory party HQ and the Swiss branch of HSBC? The Prime Minister, he claimed, was up to his neckin Minister, he claimed, was up to his neck in the scandal. He and his donors were banned to rights. He is a dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors! Even by the standards of Prime Minister ‘s questions, that was pretty strong stuff. MPs can say things in the Commons which they often wouldn’t dare to say outside. As Miliband singled out one Tory donor who now says that if the allegation is made outside, the Labour leader will end up in court. The man in question is Lord Fink, who has given the Tories £3 million and has made a peer and party treasurer by David Cameron. I challenge Ed Miliband to repeat his allegations outside the House of Commons, or perhaps to withdraw them publicly. Thank you. Ed Miliband’s aides insist he is prepared to repeat. The Prime Minister was keen to point out that notjust his donors had their names published. The Labour donor Lord Paul has been named, he thundered Gordon Brown’s election campaign. -- named, he thundered Gordon Brown’s election campaign. -- he thundered. People should pay taxes in our country. There are still questions about why this man, head of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a peer and a trade minister. I am not prepared to comment. David Cameron said he took all the available advice but refuses to say if he has ever asked Lord Green about tax avoidance. If you thought this story was all about the behaviour of the banks, thinks it -- was all about the behaviour of the banks, thinks it -- think again. It is also another act in a long pre-election drama. The conflict in eastern Ukraine is about to spin out of control unless a peace deal is agreed within days. That’s the stark warning from President Poroshenko as the fighting continues to rage and more lives are lost every day. The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine have been taking part in a peace summit with a focus on securing a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and creating a demilitarised zone. Our international correspondent Ian Pannell reports from Donetsk. Ukraine’s at war with itself. Its people bear the brunt of a brutal conflict about identity and sovereignty and this is what’s become parts of its industrial heartland. Desolate. Destroyed. Both sides say they’re defending their territory. In truth, their shells are invariably slamming into civilian areas. Here, captured on video by local residents, the results are as terrifying as they are devastating. More than 5,000 have been killed, a million-and-a-half uprooted. These are the rebels, pro-Russian and battling government plans tojoin the EU. What these men are fighting for is nothing less than the creation of a new state, here in eastern Ukraine. The more blood that’s been split, so the more entrenched positions have become. Both sides now have a very different vision of the future and, without a political resolution, they’re willing to enforce that through massive fire power. Russia’s accused of sending troops and armour to help the rebels, an allegation Moscow denies, but there are shared visions for the future of eastern Ukraine. TRANSLATION: In the beginning, we just wanted more autonomy, but after everything the Ukrainian army has done to us, we want to be independent. We will create Novoazovsk as a separate state. But the people are paying heavily for this war. In a subterranean shanty town, two old women hide from the artillery shells overhead. Vera and Ludmila have been down here for seven months. Two pensioners and their pets forced under ground. The government shelled their homes and cut off their pensions. They’re trying to recreate a little bit of life above ground, but with no means of escape. TRANSLATION: Our pensions aren’t being paid. Could they at least give us our pensions so we can go and buy something to eat? It’s been seven months since they stopped our money. What can we hope for? We seem to have been somehow erased from some list and we are nowhere. It’s Ludmila’s birthday today, she’s 73. The only ones who dare patrol the streets above them are the young men of the rebel army. This crisis is escalating at an alarming rate and if peace talks fail again, the war on Europe’s eastern flank risks spiralling even further out of control. Ian Pannell, BBC News, Donetsk. The The Russians said the talks were proceeding actively. With that in mind let us talk to our chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, who is in Minsk for us. What do you make of them getting a deal here It’s one of the last chances for a political solution for this crisis. The images tell you an awful lot. The Presidents were barely looking at each when they were forced to shake hands. An image of Vladimir Putin snapping a pencil in two around a table where nobody was smiling. In the end what this will come down is what the Ukrainian President is willing to accept as a compromise and what Russia is willing to offer. Ukraine, backed by the West wants to restore its territorial integrity including control over its border with Russia. The separatists, backed by Russia, want to remain in control of the territory that they have taken. The best that can be achieved is a freezing of the conflict no wonder when the Russian Foreign Minister was asked how the talks were going, he had one word ""super."" Thank you for the update. Lyse Doucet there for us. Every NHS Trust in England should appoint a guardian to support staff who raise concerns about patient care. That’s one of the recommendations of an official review which found that thousands of NHS staff have been bullied and intimidated by senior colleagues after raising concerns about standards of care. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, has more details. The Mid Staffordshire scandal saw avoidable deaths, inhumane treatments of patients and staff scared to speak out. Yet, two years on from the official report on the hospital, the author says there’s still a serious problem in the NHS with whistleblowers afraid to come forward. They’ve been bullied. In some cases, they’ve lost theirjobs and, in one sad case, someone told me about wanting to commit suicide. No-one who raises a concern, no-one who goes to work to help patients, should end up in those sort of situations. Sir Robert emphasises that staff can come to feel isolated, cut off from colleagues if they’ve been badly treated. So his report recommends local support for whistleblowers at hospitals with a so-called ""guardian"" appointed to advise staff who want to speak out. That would be backed by a National Independent Officer, and there’d be a new support scheme to help NHS whistleblowers get back into work. Dr Kim Holt exposed failings in a childrens’ clinic where Baby P was treated. He later died after abuse and neglect which went unnoticed. She was suspended and eventually reinstated, but the whole process took its toll. Oh, it was awful. I mean, I was depressed. I was shocked. I was scared. You know, it kept me awake at I used to be waking up in the night and reading my emails and not able to sleep. It occupied pretty much most of my day-time thinking. The Health Secretary, jeremy Hunt, told MPs he backed the Francis’ proposals and would legislate to protect whistleblowers from job discrimination. Labour said the measures should go further to cover care homes. Dr Raj Mattu, who’s a heart specialist, has spent the last 13 years in a battle with his employers after he raised concerns about safety. He won his case at a tribunal, but fears he’ll never work again. After hearing today’s announcement at Westminster, he told me Sir Robert Francis hadn’t done enough to protect whistleblowers. I couldn’t at all support or encourage anybody to put their whole life and career at risk for patients’ safety because, inevitably, they’re going to continue, as they do at this very moment, to be persecuted and victimised because there isn’t those protections in place working to protect whistleblowers. Even after this review? Even after this review at this moment. Hospital bosses said the NHS had been rated one of the safest healthcare systems in the world, but Sir Robert’s message is that the NHS is in need of a change of culture. Hugh Pym, BBC News. Essex Police have apologised to alleged victims of child abuse after ""uncovering problems"" with its investigations. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is to review the cases, which are thought to involve 59 possible victims. The watchdog is investigating 12 officers. At least 300 migrants are thought to have drowned this week while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa. The United Nations say it’s a ""tragedy on an enormous scale."" Survivors brought to the Italian island of Lampedusa said they were forced by human traffickers in Libya to risk the crossing in rough seas. Our correspondent, Caroline Hawley, has Our correspondent, Caroline Hawley, has the story. They dreamt of a new life somewhere that was safe. Today the bodies of 29 would be migrants were transported off the island of Lampedusa, they died of hype they were ya. On Monday 100 other people were rescued. More than 300 more are now believed to have drowned in waves as high as eight meters. The Mediterranean has been described as a graveyard for migrants. There is harsh criticism from humanitarian groups for the European Union for not doing more to save lives. Today, even the Pope weighed in. He offered prayers for the victims and said that those in need should be rescued. In November last year Italy ended its search and rescue mission after its EU partners refused to share its rung costs. It was replaced with a limited EU operation with fewer resources and only a third of the funding. At the same time the number of would be migrants has soared. In 2013, 60,000 people managed to cross the Mediterranean with more than 600 drowning on the way. In 2014 that figure had increased to 170,000 with more than 3,000 drowning. With the continuing turmoil in the Middle East, the number of desperate people willing to risk everything is expected to rise. So far this year, 15 times as many people have died on the way than in the same period last year. According to the testimony that we have collected of the survivors, most of them have been forced on this rubber boats at gunpoint. That is what of course should make the whole international community reflect. The government says the UK will continuing trying to tackle the causes of illegal immigration and the trafficking gangs behind it rather than helping to step up search and rescue operations. Assuming the world can’t stop the tide of human suffering that is pushing people to the seas, many, many more people will die. Caroline Hawley, BBC News. Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP, is calling for an end to austerity measures and for the UK budget deficit to be reduced at a slower pace after the general election. She said her party wanted to increase UK public spending by £180 billion by 2020. Some opinion polls have suggested that the SNP might hold the balance of power at Westminster after May’s election, The number of children growing up as Muslims in the UK has almost doubled in a decade. A study of official census data showed that one in 12 school children in England and Wales are Muslim. With me now is our religious affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt. This placed on the last census. It will be immense help to people at the NHS to find out what provision they make and give hard facts about Muslims living in England and Wales. The Muslim population has grown rapidly over the past decade. They are a younger population than the average, a third are 15 or under. It shows how Muslims identify themselves. 3% say they identify themselves solely as British even though only half were actually born in Britain. Economically, for example, it’s mixed. Levels of downpour were vision have risen even as education levels for women have grown up. There is a disproportionate numbers of Muslims ins prison. Thank you very much. President Obama has asked Congress to authorise the use of military force against Islamic State extremists. The President says he already has the formal authority to attack IS, but he wants the clear support of Congress. The new measure would expire in three years and would not permit ""enduring offensive combat operations."" The US has been carrying out air strikes against IS since last year. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, reports from Washington. laid out by the President to degrade and destroys lappic state militants. The problem is, there is a growing recognition this isn’t going to happen by air power alone. The President has now gone to Congress to seek the authority to expand the operation against IS. No, he insisted, this isn’t cover for a fresh invasion by ground troops, but... This resolution strikes the necessary balance by giving us the flexibility we need for unfor seen circumstances. For example, if we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders, and our partners didn’t have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our special forces to take action because I will not allow these terrorists to have a safe This is the haven. First time since 9/111 Congress has been asked to authorise military operations. For the past year we have reported on the gridlock in Congress with the Republicans blocking proposals coming from The White House. Now, it’s slightly the other way round. With the Democrats queasy about giving the President authority to send ground troops to fight Islamic State. The Republicans, though still criticising the President’s strategy, nevertheless giving him their backing. I believe if we’re going to authorise use of military force, the President should have all the tools necessary to win the fight that we’re in. Contrast that to the heavily qualified support from Democratic leaders. Their emphasis is on limiting presidential power. We hope to have bipartisan support for something that would limit the power of the President, but nonetheless protect the American people in a very strong way. Barack Obama saw it as one of his signature achievements to bring the soldiers home from Iraq. After today’s announce am, how long before some of these troops are flying back to the region with critics worrying this is less mission accomplished than mission creep. jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington.

Fighting is intensifying in eastern Ukraine, hours before a ceasefire is due to come into force. There’s been heavy shelling of the city of Debaltseve, where Ukrainian government forces are besieged by pro-Russian rebels. Under a peace deal agreed on Thrusday, the two sides are to withdraw their forces behind an agreed separation line. Our World Affairs Correspondent Rob Broomby reports. It is these on paper but not on the ground. Fighting has intensified ahead of the planned cease-fire on Sunday with Russian rebels accused of launching a land grab. The talk of the peace has not altered their activities. There was a strike at the Ukrainian stronghold of Debaltseve. Kiev has denied claims that thousands of its troops inside. The US Embassy in Moscow released a satellite image on twitter and they said proves that Russia now has big guns positioned near the town. A local police chief said that the rebels are destroying the settlement. Government forces were poured more than 100 attacks as the rebels struggle for strategic advantage ahead of the peace. It is a concern shared in Washington. Motion units along the border with Ukraine are preparing a large shipment of supplies to forces fighting in eastern Ukraine. Clearly not in the spirit of the agreement this week. This is notjust an spirit of the agreement this week. This is not just an attack on Ukrainian civilians but on the Minsk stronghold. On the ground ordinary families fleeing the fight into safety, where they can get it. In this case into Russia. It is simple food but badly needed. The sign in the car window, children on board, unlikely to offer protection from the bullets and the shelves. As always vulnerable most risk. In Donetsk the damage is plain to see with homes in flames and vocals destroyed. The deal was heralded as a major breakthrough but with hours to go it does not look as if peace is set to break out any time soon. Our correspondent David Stern is in Kiev. The cease-fire is due to start in ten hours. What are the prospects? Well they do not look good at the moment. As you heard in that report the fighting is intensifying. This could be a land grab before the deadline. And of course the cease-fire would be introduced perhaps hours or days afterwards. But at the moment the escalation is intensifying. We are hearing about heavy fighting around Debaltseve. Apparently the shelling is almost levelling the town. We also heard about increased casualties not only among civilians but amongst the soldiers. Seven have died in the past 21+ hours. So it will be very interesting and perhaps we will not see a cease-fire in ten hours time. People with weight, alcohol or drug problems could have their sickness benefit cut if they refuse treatment under proposals being considered by the Conservatives. David Cameron says it isn’t fair to ask taxpayers to fund the benefits of people who won’t accept help which could get them back to work. Alex Forsyth reports. Obesity and addiction, both can wreak havoc with health. There are according to the Conservatives, around 100,000 people with these conditions currently claiming sickness benefit. That is worth around £100 per week. The Prime Minister has ordered a review into how to help them back to work. And it will consider whether people should lose benefits if they refuse treatment. This is about making sure we get people to engage with the support available so they can get back into work and support their families. The idea of addict accepting treatment for claiming benefits was once suggested by the Labour Party. The party says the announcement will not help people off benefits because there are not adequate support programmes. Some charities said is the same for obese people. People may have diabetes, rheumatism or heart problems and we’ll all need different kinds of treatment to deal with those. With this idea the Conservatives run the risk of being seen to target some of the poorest in society. But they know that many working taxpayers like the policies which ensure that benefits only go to those who really need them. I travel 80 miles a day to go to work. I work seven days a week and pay for my family. Why can they not do the same. There are too many people getting something for nothing. It is time we sorted them out. I think it will be difficult because people have limited motivation to take on treatment. This is only an idea that might become policy future Conservative government. But the Battle of the Bulge could become a battle over benefits. At least one person has died - and more than 6 others are injured after a major accident on the M1+0 involving dozens of cars. The collision happened between junctions 9 and 10, near Bicester in Oxfordshire. A crash involving a coach and a car has closed the M1 northbound between junctions 12 and 13, near Flitwick.

They were dismissed for 231 - asjoe Wilson reports. Exactly how Australia imagine the World Cup would begin, every boundary by Aaron Finch reminded England they had dropped him. Three of the England wickets came with the last three balls. The hat-trick a cause for celebration. Chasing that, Owen Morgan, the England captain. Again zero. The fifth wicket from Mitchell Marsh belonged to the field. james Taylor was dropped early in his innings and made Australia regret it, to an extent. He made 98. The final scenes were farcical. Taylor out LBW, overturned on with you and then Anderson given run out on the same ball. Everyone understood that Australia had one.

So pretty decent outlook for the rugby matches through this afternoon. As we head into this evening and overnight, the cloud returns to many areas. Some fog around as well especially over higher ground. With all the cloud cover there will be a frost free night, just some cooler spots across western areas. For Sunday morning, it promises to be a rather drab start. Some mist and fog around. But as we head to the afternoon there is more cloud breaks appearing so quite decent for much of Wales, the South West of England, the Midlands and the South East. Might wind as well and temperatures could reach up to 11 degrees in the brightest spots. North-west England and much of central, southern and northern Scotland, some cloud breaks allowing for some sunshine. But turning wet and windy across the north of Scotland.

By Monday morning it will lie across central areas of stop feeling cold and raw with that rain. A cold start for Northern Ireland but then it promises to be a bright day with some sunshine later.

A terrorist manhunt is under way after two gunmen opened fire at a cafe in Denmark hosting a meeting about freedom of expression. Detectives say one person has died and three officers have been wounded in the attack in Copenhagen. The gunmen are still at large. A controversial Swedish artist was at the event, along with the the French ambassador. Our correspondent, Malcolm Brabant, joins us from the Danish capital. The latest is there is a substantial manhunt under way for the two perpetrators. The police are describing this as a terrorist attack. They are now looking for these two men somewhere in Copenhagen. They’ve fired, it’s believed, with automatic weapons, possibly AK-li7s into the cafe, where this meeting was being held. Possibly 30 or 1+0 rounds were shot. They hit four people, one of whom, a civilian, died, two intelligence agents were wounded as was a policeman. Their condition is not life-threatening. These men, they also had fire back from the intelligence agents. They got to the car, they drove away. They abandoned it several blocks away. The manhunt is now on. Thank you for that. With the background here is our reporter Rob Bromby. Why do we say but... GUNFIRE It was billed as a debate on blasphemy and freedom of expression. The moment caught on a mobile phone. Scores of bullet holes at the scene gave evidence of a ferocious attack. Another European city, Copenhagen, in the cross-hairs of intolerance. A student who witnessed the attack from the inside, described the panic in the room. We heard shots from the room next door, I’m not sure how many shots. I’d say about 20 or 30 shots. We heard a person yelling something in a language I don’t understand. I think it was Arabic maybe, I’m not certain. A number of police officers were shot and wounded before the masked attackers, both male, made their escape in a VW Polio, later found -- both male, made their escape in a VW Polio, laterfound -- Polo, later found abandoned. TRANSLATION: We can confirm there has been a civilian. One -- TRANSLATION: We can confirm there has been a civilian. One -- has been a shooting. One shiflian has died. Emergency services arrived on the scene. Inside the cafe the Swedish artist, Lars Vilks, known for controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, he’s faced countless threats before. He was whisked away unharmed. Also in the meeting the French ambassador who tweeted, ""Stillalive, in the room."" He too had survived the ordeal. It was normally a place of harmony, a cafe that hosted jazz concerts. It had been turned into a place of horror. The long shadow of intimidation has fallen once again across a peaceful community. There’s been fierce fighting in eastern Ukraine, just hours before a ceasefire is due to come into force. The city of Debaltseve - where Ukrainian government forces are besieged by pro-Russian rebels - has been heavily bombarded. Under a peace deal agreed on Thursday, the two sides are set to withdraw their forces behind an agreed separation line. Our World Affairs Correspondent, Caroline Hawley, reports. just hours to go before the guns should fall silent, and the omens aren’t good. The Ukrainian military, seen here on the move, accuses pro-Russian rebels of a last-minute land grab, to expand the territory under their control. They’d been pounding Ukrainian government positions in Debaltseve, a key target for the rebels, since it links two of their strong holds. Both the Ukrainians and Americans are accusing Russia of re-supplying rebel fighters. The American embassy in Moscow released this satellite image, which it says shows Russian artillery around Debaltseve. Under the cease-fire, both sides must stop fighting tonight at 10pm. Then they have two days to begin pulling back the heavy weapons from the front lines. With a neutral buffer zone to be created within two weeks. Longer term, there’s a promise for the rebels of greater regional powers, but it’s a plan fraught with obstacles and already the Ukrainian government is making plans for if it fails. TRANSLATION: If there is no peace, we may have to take the decision to impose marshal law, not only in the Donetsk region, but across the whole country. On the eve of the truce, the death toll already well over 5,000, rose further. This was the result of a shell in Donetsk. Across eastern Ukraine, terrorised civilians long for peace. This little girl stammers as she describes how she ran to the cellar when the shell hit. Help save these angels, her mother begs. What did they do wrong? In the Ukrainian government controlled town here, more shells an destruction. The violence today escalated not abated. If the peace deal fails, and many fear it will, the flames of Ukraine’s conflict will be hard to contain. Our International Correspondent, Ian Pannell, is in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Given that the cease-fire is just hours away, given the increase in violence, is there any hope? It’s a very good question. People don’t feel hopeful that the peace is about to break out at any time soon. As I’m talking to you, in the background, there is a constant sound of volleys of artillery and rockets going out and coming in to Donetsk, the same picture repeated across many front lines here. I’ve talked to a number of rebel commanders over the last few days. They’re adamant that they’re not going to cede ground. The mood seems equally hardened on the Ukrainian side. We got through to a front line position. Their position was they don’t plan to aBoyd by the cease-fire. People want there to be peace, but I think it’s fair to summarise that, at the moment, people don’t expect to wake up on Sunday morning and find peace in their town.

Denmark is on high alert, after a gunman kills one, and injures three others, at a meeting on free speech. A huge manhunt is underway after an attack the Danish Prime Minister blames on terrorism. As fighting continues right up to the deadline. 15 minutes into the ceasefire, Ukraine holds its breath. Still unbeaten, England plough on in the Six Nations, with victory over Italy. Good evening. Denmark is on high alert tonight after a gunman fired into a cafe in Copenhagen, killing one person and injuring three police officers. The cafe was hosting a meeting about freedom of expression and blasphemy at the time of the shooting. A controversial Swedish cartoonist was at the event, along with the French Ambassador. The Danish Prime Minister described the attack as a ""politically motivated"" act of terrorism. Our correspondent, Malcolm Brabant, is in Copenhagen tonight. Malcolm. It has been a shocking day in Denmark which are supposed to be the safest country in the world, but tonight, at the country’s borders with Sweden and Germany, they sealed as police look for a lone gunman, the target of his attack was a controversial Swedish artist who survived. The gunman opened up with an automatic gun on the cafe staging a debate about freedom of expression in the wake of the massacre of Charlie Hebdo. This is what it sounded like from inside the building. Iam not building. I am not sure how many shots... We had a person yelling something in a language. Police and intelligence agents inside the cafe returned fire but four people were hit, a lIo-year-old civilian died from his wounds. Two agents and one police officer were hurt but their injuries were not life-threatening. We feel certain now that it is a politically motivated attack and it is a terrorist attack. Police released a photograph of the suspect, wearing a balaclava and who is said by witnesses to have shouted out in Arabic. The target is believed to have been a controversial Swedish artist, Lars Vilks, who has had a price on his head since 2007 and who has survived a couple of other attacks since depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a dog. He was inside the building but was not hurt, nor was the French Ambassador who was also participating in the debate. Denmark has been an object of hate for Islamists for nearly a decade since a newspaper published 12 cartoons of the Prophet including one showing him with a bomb in his turban. Denmark has been bracing itself for a terrorist attack ever since the Charlie Hebdo attack five weeks ago. This has demonstrated that despite the best preparations, little can be done to defend against a determined individual, and what is also clear is that if there had not been Danish -- Danish intelligence agents hasn’t here, the outcome could have been for worse. Police are warning people to beware of the gunman but they are not sure if this attack was a one-off or if others are planned. Tonight, the biggest manhunt Denmark has perhaps ever known is underway, police are scarring an area near a railway station a couple of blocks away whether getaway car was abandoned. The Army has been called in to help and tonight, Denmark, the country supposed to be one of the happiest on Earth, has lost its innocence. just minutes after a ceasefire in Ukraine, the guns appear to have fallen silent- at least, for the moment. Heavy fighting was reported right up until the deadline at midnight local time. The city of Debaltseve, where Ukrainian government forces are besieged by pro-Russian rebels, has been particularly heavily bombarded. Under a peace deal agreed on Thursday, the two sides are set to withdraw their forces behind an agreed separation line. This report from our International Correspondent, Ian Pannell.

These men fight for a government that wants to ally itself with the West, facing an on me that looks East to Moscow. -- facing an on me that looks East to Moscow. -- an enemy. As the deadline approached, the fighting grew. Rebel forces have impounding government troops, pins down in the strategic town of Debaltseve.

The US even released satellite images which it says show Russian artillery around Debaltseve. The Kremlin has consistently denied these charges. Under the peace deal, both sides should have stopped fighting by ten P~m~Â should have stopped fighting by ten p.m., midnight in Kiev. Heavy weapons supposed to be pulled back from the front lines. Creating a neutral buffer zone within the next two weeks. In the long term, rebels have been promised the chance for greater regional powers but many do not like this agreement and some rejected. The fear is that like the first peace deal, it could break down with disastrous consequences. More than 5,000 people have been killed in this war and despite promises of use, the death toll rose further today. promises of use, the death toll rose furthertoday. -- promises of use, the death toll rose furthertoday. -- list.

Help save these angels, her mother says. What did they do wrong? So the challenge is to stop scenes like this. The immediate future for the Ukraine perhaps is the stability of the region, and it hinges on the coming days. There is hope the guns will fall silent, but bitter experience teaches caution and fear. Our International Correspondent, Ian Pannell, is in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine. Is this cease-fire holding? It is only 22 minutes old? Yes, and that is the most important point, it is still very early days. Effectiveness or otherwise will not be measured in a matter of minutes, hours or days. It will be whether it truly does last. It is fair to say the guns that have been pounding heavily outgoing from the rebel held areas throughout this evening did suddenly fall silentjust after areas throughout this evening did suddenly fall silent just after the cease-fire came into effect. So for now at least, things are calm but it will take a while. It will take the monitoring organisation to go out onto the ground and it will notjust the about whether those guns stop firing, but the other conditions of that treatment, will they be pulled back, will the political process go forward? And you mentioned about the key town of Debaltseve.

The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, has announced that if he becomes Prime Minister, he’ll begin an immediate independent review into the culture and practices of the UK’s tax inspectors. He said the investigation into HMRC would begin immediately after the General Election, and report by the end ofjuly. Here is our Political Correspondent, Iain Watson. Ed Miliband believes the revelations that this bank’s subsidiary helped wealthy people avoid tax gives him a political opportunity and he is now trying to create clear the water with the Conservatives by promising to investigate why Revenue and Customs are not doing more to prosecute those who evade tax. It is a country with one rule for the powerful and another for everyone else, it is time we changed this, and that is what a Labour government will do! And that is why Ed Balls and I are announcing today an independent root and branch review of the culture and practice of HMRC when it comes to tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. What goes on behind closed doors at the Revenue and Customs holding is becoming highly political, Ed Miliband accuses them of doing sweetheart deals with those who avoid tax and he wants this issue to become a big dividing line between the Conservatives at the next election, but they are not giving ground. They say they have brought in an extra £100 billion partly as a result of closing tax loopholes left open by Labour. When Labour were open by Labour. When Labourwere in When Labour were in power, you had a situation where bankers were routinely paying less tax than cleaners, foreigners were not paying stamp duty and the richest of paying the least tax.

According to prosecutors, he is accused of murder and attempted murder with two charges of heat and run and this stems from an incident towards the end of last week at a carpark at a fast food restaurant when it seems he was in an argument with two men. According to Knight’s lawyer he was trying to escape the scene because he had been attacked and the fact that one man died and the other was hurt he says was an accident. The other side of the story is that this was a deliberate attempt to cause harm and the death of one man and injuries to the other. He is denying, according to his lawyer, those charges and he will appear in court on Tuesday, LA time, just a few hours are we. He is still injail and his bail has been revoked because according to the authorities they are concerned about witnesses being intimidated -- authorities they are concerned about witnesses being intimidated -- away. And that he could be a flight risk, that he could attempt to get out of California and away from the scene of the crime. This isn’t the first time that he has faced problems, criminal problems. He has a long list of criminal problems going back many years, he has faced jail time for violating probation on previous charges. He was currently facing a robbery charge after snatching, allegedly, the camera of a member of the paparazzi in Hollywood. He is familiar with facing serious problems. These are the most serious charges he has ever faced. problems. These are the most serious charges he has everfaced. As always, thank you very much. Now for a story of treasures hidden in plain sight. Two bronze statues that have long been dismissed as minor works of art could in fact be by Michelangelo. The pair were identified from a tiny detail in a drawing which is 500 year old. -- in a drawing which is 500 years old. If the claim proves true they would be the only surviving Michelango bronzes in the world. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz has the details. Two idealised naked male figures sit astride a couple of snarling panthers. The modelling is superb, the compositions elegant. These are bronze sculptures of the highest quality, but who did them? Art historians have been arguing about that for over 100 years. No longer, maybe. Academics at Cambridge University think they have found the answer. We’ve got some fantastic new Michelangelos, which we firmly believe on an aggregate of evidence - visual, technical and anatomical - to be early works by Michelangelo from 1586 to 1608. That means the 30-year-old Michelangelo would have produced them after carving his sculpture of David, but before starting work on painting the Sistine Chapel. To say these two pieces are by Michelangelo is a very big and significant claim. It would make them the only two known bronze sculptures in the world by the great Renaissance master. So, what’s their evidence? This is exhibit A: a drawing they happened upon, showing a male figure on a panther. It’s not by Michelangelo, but it is a direct copy from him. Then there are the stylistic similarities between the way Michelangelo depicted certain physical details in his marble carvings, the anatomical accuracy of his drawings and the representation of both in the bronzes. Finally, there is the appliance of science, where they had specialist X-rays taken which have dated the works to a time that backs up their claim, but will it be supported by the wider academic community? What tends to happen is either that they’re fairly, almost surprisingly quickly accepted and become part of the great canon of art, or they’re equally swiftly forgotten, and three minutes later, nobody remembers them at all. If they are by Michelangelo, their value would rocket well above the £1.8 million a private collector reportedly paid for them in 2002, and a new chapter would open on the extraordinary legacy of a great Italian artist.

Definitely so signs of spring this week. We keep the cold weather going with widespread overnight frost. Everything moves around slowly. Little areas of low pressure drifting from north to south and this one is weakening to an extent though still enough to bring showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland with one or two showers running through the eastern counties of England. A bit ofa A bit of a mix neither coast with more sleet and rain. Inland, falling as snow with a light covering in places. Widespread frost to start with. These are the temperatures in larger towns and cities. We start with -6 or -8 in rural spots. A really hard frost. Northern Ireland, we are back to the mix of rain, sleet and snow and some of the snow could cause problems. Especially across northern Scotland over higher ground. Forthe across northern Scotland over higher ground. For the bottle Scotland it isjust ground. For the bottle Scotland it is just very cold and frosty to start with the odd pocket of fog to throw into the mix. Through the day, at no major changes. The showers fade across Northern Ireland. Getting into the Grampians, giving a further covering of snow on higher ground. Further south the temperatures lived through the day. Showers turned to rain or sleet. Something like two minus six degrees is the highest temperatures will reach, even cooler than that in the wind. Through Tuesday night into Wednesday, this high pressure area topples in, changing things. It won’t change the overnight temperatures much, again a hard frost in many places outside the larger towns and cities. So, cold to start Wednesday. Further snow showers on the east of England. A mix of rain, sleet and snow in places. The wind has an edge to it blowing in from the north. Light winds further north and west. A-5 not feeling bad in the sunshine. In Northern Ireland, A5 near the east coast. Feeling quite raw -- A-5. The easterly wind setting in for the latter part of the week, noticeably on Thursday with a dry story. That’s how is it up late in the week with high pressure coming across the UK. But pulling in some cold easterly winds. The latest headlines from BBC News: Australian journalist Peter Greste says he is relieved to have been freed from jail in Egypt, but feels incredible angst at leaving two of his colleagues behind. He served 400 days of a seven-year sentence, after being convicted of helping the Muslim Brotherhood. A senior White House official says President Obama may be considering sending weapons to help the Ukrainian military. The US has so far only supplied non-lethal aid to Ukraine’s government, which has been battling pro-Russian separatists since April. Former rap mogul Suge Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder. It comes after he struck two men with his pickup truck, one of whom died. Prosecutors claim Knight meant to run them over after an argument in Los Angeles. His lawyer says it was accidental, as he tried to escape a vicious attack. David Cameron says he would change the way England’s schools are funded if the Conservatives won the next election. He would protect spending on state schools, but admitted that funding per child would not keep pace with inflation. Labour said the cat was out of the bag, as our political editor Nick Robinson reports. Tah-dah! And there you have it. David Cameron’s new election promise to protect spending on English schools. But hold on, is this Conservative commitment really as generous as it might at first appear? We have demonstrated in the past five years that we can protect the schools budget while reducing the deficit and we will do so again. So I can tell you, with the Conservative Government, the amount of money following your child into the school, that will not be cut. In Treasury speak, flat cash per pupil. Can we just translate ""flat cash""? I think anybody doing economics at this school knows that flat cash means a cut in real terms. It means money does not keep pace with inflation? What it means is that the cash sum that follows your child into the school will not be cut. Maybe, but if prices do go up, the amount spent per pupil will not keep pace. The budget a school has might go up, though, simply because the number of pupils they take looks set to increase. I accept that is a difficult decision for some schools. Because the amount of cash per child is not going up by inflation. The amount of cash is staying the same. It is already difficult in some schools, particularly those like Southend High, a successful grammar school. It doesn’t benefit from those big top-up payments called the pupil premium, which are given to schools which take a lot of kids from deprived homes. The Head is campaigning for David Cameron to think again. His budget deficit next year looks to be around £250,000. It’s the schools that are quiet, effective, efficient deliverers of superb outcomes that are in a position where they can’t break even. His pupils say they are feeling the squeeze. We don’t have the money to function as a school. We can keep the lights on, but that’s about it. And in lessons, it’s to the point where, if there are hand-outs to be given out, sorry, there’s not enough for one each because of the printing costs. So A3 paper is now like gold dust. Only a few weeks ago, Tory Ministers were advised to dodge questions on school spending. Their briefing paper told them to say, ""Of course, there will be difficult decisions in the education budget in the next Parliament."" What exactly does that mean? For schools as a whole, it looks like it is roughly like a real-terms freeze. Obviously the real amount of resources per pupil will go down. Actually, over this Parliament, that hasn’t gone down. Labour say the cat is out of the bag. But they won’t yet spell out what they’d spend. Do Labour promise to go further? Do you say there will be real-terms increases in schools’ budgets? The Labour Party has always supported our education system, and an Ed Miliband government would continue to do so. We will set out that in the run-up to the general election. The Lib Dems say they are committed to protecting the whole education budget. So what this will mean is a real-terms squeeze on schools, which they have not experienced in this Parliament, because the Liberal Democrats insisted on protecting the schools budget, but if the Conservatives ended up governing by themselves in the next parliament, it would be a bad time for schools. There was no drum roll, but David Cameron clearly thought it was a big deal that he promised to protect spending on every pupil in England’s schools. What he didn’t do is promise to protect it from inflation. He didn’t promise to protect the rest of the education budget. And he certainly can’t promise to protect the rest of public spending from bigger cuts that will have to be made as a result. Nick Robinson, BBC News, Enfield, North London. The recent cuts in energy bills could have been much bigger, according to the consumer group Which. It claims households should have saved an average £1lI5 last year. The research to be published tomorrow suggests that energy firms should now be cutting gas and electricity prices by as much as 10%. Our industry correspondent john Moylan has been looking at the figures. In the energy world, these are turbulent times. For the past year, wholesale prices have been falling, but are households across Britain really feeling the benefit? Pensioner Richard Langdon keeps an eye on his bills. As a British Gas customer, his tariff will fall by 5% at the end of February. He thinks that is too little, too late. It has to be nonsense, because wholesale prices have dropped quite a lot, and there is no reason for the industry they are in not to drop the price for the consumer. Which compared how the suppliers buy energy and compared that with much they charge all of us for it. It found that savings of £1lI5 on a standard dual fuel bill could have been passed on to households last year. That amounts to total savings of £2.9 billion across Britain. And it says that there is room for further cuts to gas and electricity prices of up to 10% in the year ahead. The mismatch between wholesale energy costs and the price we all pay on our bill has been big and growing steadily. There is no excuse for any supplier not to pass through these savings to their customers, unless we have an energy market that is not working competitively. The suppliers don’t agree. They say that the energy we are using today may have been bought a few years ago. They do this to secure supplies, to keep the lights on and to shield households from volatile prices. You can’t suddenly pass the savings on in one chunk. It is only as your buying strategy unwinds and you as you can actually take advantage of these new, lower wholesale prices that you can pass those on to your customers. Do you believe that the price cuts we have seen recently really reflect what has been going on in the wholesale markets? Yes, I think that is a fair reflection. As prices are falling, as companies can actually afford to pass those savings on, they are doing so. The energy market is now in the midst of a major competition investigation, that should tell us once and for all whether the price we pay for energy is fair. john Moylan, BBC News. The first paramedic to reach the casualties of the Hillsborough disaster has been giving evidence at the inquest. Tony Edwards was in an ambulance on the day of the tragedy when 96 fans died at the stadium. Our correspondent is in Warrington, where the inquests are being held. Tony Edwards giving evidence today was very critical of the response in the aftermath of the disaster. He said he had been surprised and concerned that there was no systematic assessment of casualties on the pitch. He explained how he had been called to the ground in the aftermath of the incident unfolding, had been unable to get his ambulance onto the pitch. He explained that a policeman told him he could not go on the pitch because fans were still fighting. It was only because the more senior ambulance member of staff told him to ignore that instruction that he had driven onto the pitch to get the casualties at the lettings Lane end. The jury saw the match footage which captured his ambulance driving through the crowds to the lettings Lane end where Tony Edwards got out of the ambulance. He said he was looking for a senior ambulance member of staff who could direct him, or help him prioritise the most serious casualties. He says there was no one there. He said it appeared that people were no longer breathing. Some were lying on their backs, a couple were giving CPR. He said from the moment I got out of the ambulance there were people making demands of me. People who understood the situation and were watching wanting oxygen, to fibrillation, a doctor, lots of things were being asked for all at once. He was asked what he thought in general about the entire response to the disaster. He said there was no response. There wasjust to the disaster. He said there was no response. There was just me. no response. There wasjust me. He will continue giving evidence here tomorrow. Earlier in the day the iury tomorrow. Earlier in the day the jury heard from Liverpool’s solicitor, who explained that in the aftermath of the disaster he had been to a meeting of club officials and police officers where he said the match commander explained that it was Liverpool fans who had forced a gate open, and had, in his view, led to the crush. He said also fans had failed to heed police warnings to arrive early, and that had increased the build-up of pressure outside the lettings Lane terraces for the crush in which 96 Liverpool fans died. Labour has promised it would give new powers to the Scottish Parliament which could lead to higher state pensions and welfare benefits than the rest of the UK. The former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Labour’s Scottish leader jim Murphy explained that the money to top up the payments would need to be raised in Scotland but the SNP said Labour was simply in a panic ahead of the general election. Our correspondent Laura Bicker reports. Can this Labour line-up save the party from defeat in Scotland? The former Prime Minister is back on the campaign trail. Once again he is talking about more powers for the Scottish Parliament. This time he says his party will go further than ever before. I tell you, with the powers we are talking about today, the Scottish Parliament will not be powerless to act on jobs, it will not be powerless to act on the housing crisis. It will not be powerless to act on youth unemployment. And no longer can the SNP practice this blame game that some body else is to blame and not them. Polls suggest Labour are losing votes to the SNP. The owner of this sweetie shop used to vote Labour but felt betrayed by the party and Gordon Brown during the independence referendum. It’s as if somebody is pulling his strings, sending him to Scotland. ""You go and persuade them,"" basically. It’s not going to work this time. They have lost their way with the people who have supported them the most. I suppose I would like to see them becoming more left-wing. The SNP says this offer still will not be voters’ tastes. This is a panic in the Labour Party at the rise of the Scottish National Party and the panic in advance of the Westminster election. The independence referendum has focused voters’ minds in Scotland. With this latest pledge of more powers, Labour is trying to win back voters they may have lost during that referendum, and also trying to speak with a distinctly Scottish voice. But will it be enough to make those voters listen? Passengers on a London bus had a lucky escape when its roof was ripped off after it hit a tree. Two people were taken to hospital with facial injuries and two others were treated for minor injuries after the Number 91 bus clipped an overhanging tree on Kingsway in Central London.

Everything becomes slow-moving at the moment. Areas of low pressure drift southwards across the UK and drape snow showers across the north of Scotland, through Northern Ireland in the early part of Tuesday with one or two turning up across eastern England as well. A bit of a mix near the coast with more of sleet and rain. Inland, potentially falling as snow with further light coverings in places. Widespread frost to start with. These are the temperatures in larger towns and cities. In rural spots we start with -6, -8 in places, so, really hard frost.

Our top stories: Australian journalist Peter Greste says he’s relieved to be free, but feels ""incredible angst"" for his two colleagues still in prison in Egypt. Amidst this relief, I still feel a sense of concern and worry because if it’s appropriate and right for me to be free... Ukraine’s pro-Russian rebels plan to recruit thousands more troops. As fighting intensifies, the US considers arming Kiev. After a fatal hit-and-run accident, former rap mogul ‘Suge’ Knight is charged with murder. And they’ve been overlooked Canada’s for 500 years, but these two bronze since statues may be priceless Greste masterpieces by Michelangelo. Hello. The release of a second Aljazeera journalist from an Egyptian jail is imminent, according to Canada’s Foreign Minister. It’s just a day since the Australian journalist Peter Greste was freed, more than 400 days into a seven-year sentence. He has spoken of his anguish at having to leave behind his two colleagues, the Egyptianjournalist Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy, who has dual Egyptian-Canadian citizenship. All were accused of helping the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Orla Guerin reports. After a year behind bars with his Aljazeera colleagues, Peter Greste can now look forward to covering news, not making it, and to being reunited with his family. In his first interview, he explained how the nightmare ended. The prison warden called me over and told me that, you know, it’s time to pack your stuff. I said, what do you mean? He said, you’re going. Isaid, well, where? To another prison? No, the embassy is coming, they will be here in an hour. Get your stuff and go. And I can’t tell you that real mix of emotions that were boiling inside. His happiness tempered by anxiety about producers Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who are still prisoners. Amidst all of this relief, I still feel a sense of concern, and a real sense of worry, because if it’s appropriate for me, if it’s right for me to be free, then it’s right for all of them to be free. But his colleagues are not the only ones waiting forjustice. While the Aljazeera case has generated huge interest abroad, there are otherjournalists injail in Egypt, getting little or no attention. The journalists’ union here says nearly 20 reporters and photographers remain behind bars. They are all Egyptians and relatives fear that without foreign pressure they could be forgotten. It seems Shokan Abu Zeid already has been. He has spent 530 days injail without charge. His brother Mohammed tells me he was arrested covering the violent dispersal of a Muslim Brotherhood sit-in. He says prison is taking his health and his spirit. We expected he might die doing hisjob, he says. We would have accepted that. But for him to die every day, that is hard for us. As Peter Greste savours freedom, the judge who jailed him has issued another verdict. He confirmed death sentences for 183 men convicted of killing policemen during Islamist riots. Critics say once again, Egyptianjustice is in the dock. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Cairo. A senior White House official has signalled that President Obama may be considering sending weapons to help the Ukrainian military. The US has so far only supplied non-lethal aid to Ukraine’s government, which has been battling pro-Russian separatists since April. As the conflict drags on, the Moscow- backed rebels say they plan to recruit more fighters, to bring their numbers up to 100,000. In the past nine months, more than 5,000 people have been killed and january has been one of the deadliest months. Ukrainian officials say 112 civilians have been killed by separatist shelling and other attacks. The pro-Russian rebels say 242 civilians died in the month. They also say 92 of their fighters have been killed in clashes with Ukraine forces. The separatists are trying to capture the town of Debaltseve from government forces, a crucial railhead linking the two main rebel-held cities, Donetsk and Luhansk. David Stern reports from Kiev. Ukrainian artillery pounds separatist positions in the country’s east. This footage was recorded recently near the strategic railroad hub of Debaltseve. In the past week, fierce fighting has gripped the region. Kiev officials say their forces are holding out against a rebel offensive. Russian-backed militants, seen here, say they have surrounded the pro-Kiev troops in Debaltseve, and are tightening the noose. On Monday, the rebels said they would boost their forces to 100,000 fighters. Where they would recruit so many men was not clear. Kiev and Western leaders fear the separatists will launch, with Russian assistance, a full-scale attack. The rebels say this move is defensive. TRANSLATION: We plan to form at least five additional brigades. Three motorised rifle brigades, an artillery brigade, and a tank brigade. This is the reserve which will guarantee us the ability to withstand any attack, and in case of success, to develop counter-attacks. In the West, calls are increasing to arm Kiev, to withstand the militants’ offensive. Up until now, Europe and the United States have provided non-lethal aid, like body armour. But resistance to provide the Ukrainians with weapons is still strong. TRANSLATION: Germany will not support Ukraine with weapons. It is my firm belief that this conflict cannot be solved militarily. Therefore we insist that on one hand we will impose sanctions if necessary. We have done that jointly with Europe. And, on the other hand, we will use all diplomatic means to resolve this conflict through talks. As the fighting escalates, civilians are coming under heavy fire. Untold numbers have been killed or wounded. Others, like these people, have found refuge in hastily established camps. No-one knows when they will be able to go home, or if they will have a home to return to. A tax crackdown on the overseas profits of US companies such as Apple and Microsoft is at the heart of the 2016 budget, now formally unveiled by President Obama. It proposes a one-off 14% levy on foreign income stashed away by American corporations, raising $238 billion and a 19% tax on their future foreign earnings. The budget now faces months of wrangling with a Republican-controlled Congress, which would also increase taxes for the wealthiest individuals, with the aim of helping the middle classes. Mr Obama said it was time to end what he called ""mindless austerity"" and the growing American economy allowed scope for more fairness. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well or will we build an economy where everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead? That was the focus of mY to get ahead? That was the focus of my state union address a couple of weeks ago, what I called middle-class economics. The idea that this country does best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody’s doing their fair share and plays by the same rules. The budget that Congress now has in its handsis budget that Congress now has in its hands is built on those values.

The widow of the Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko has given details of his life and career leading up to his death in 2006. He had been poisoned with radioactive material. He fled from Russia to the UK and became a vocal critic of the Kremlin. He also worked for MI6. Our security correspondent reports. Marina Litvinenko arriving this morning, a woman who spent years fighting for the truth about her husband’s death. A former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko died of radioactive polonium poisoning in a London hospital, pointing the figure of blame at the Kremlin. Today, we learnt he joined the KGB, Russia’s secret police, in the final years of the Cold War. Later, it was renamed the FSB, and he became part of an anti-terrorist unit. In 1994, an insurgency began in Chechnya. Mrs Litvinenko said her husband next joined the specialist team investigating organised crime. Here he met businessman and politician Boris Berezovsky. Some of his fellow officers then asked him something highly unusual. Speaking in the inquiry today, Marina said, ""Fellow FSB officers had asked her husband, regarding Berezovsky, ‘You know him well, would you kill him?""' Litvinenko’s anger at corruption in the FSB led him to speak out. The man who was head of the FSB, and whom Litvinenko had complained to in person, was Vladimir Putin. After that press conference, Alexander Litvinenko told his wife he might be killed. Soon after they fled to Britain. When he arrived at Heathrow Airport, he told a policeman he was a member of the KGB and wanted political asylum. In London, he became a vocal critic of Vladimir Putin. The inquiry heard he accused Mr Putin of orchestrating this bombing of apartments in Moscow to justify his rise to power. He even wrote an article claiming that Vladimir Putin was a paedophile. Marina Litvinenko today confirmed her husband began consulting for MI6 after he arrived in the UK. She said he received £2,000 a month paid direct into his bank account. Tomorrow, the inquiry will hear further evidence from Marina Litvinenko as well as from her son. Gordon Corera, BBC News, at the Royal Courts ofjustice. Bobbi Kristina, daughter of the late, is fighting for her life, her family says. She was taken to hospital on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bath at her home.

The anti-Islamisation movement Pegida, which originated in Germany, has held its first march in Austria. Several 100 people took part in the rally, in the capital Vienna. But around 5,000 joined a counter demonstration. Austria is the latest European country to see anti-Islamisation protests. A BBC correspondent in Vienna says Pegida may find few sympathisers in Austria as a well-established political party, the Freedom Party, has long campaigned on a similar platform.

Let’s round up the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to give the japanese military a mandate to evacuate japanese nationals from crises overseas following the murder of two japanese hostages. That’s in the japan Times. The New York Times reports that last month’s terror attacks in Paris have prompted a debate on whether French national identity excludes Muslims. The Moscow Times quotes analysts as saying President Vladimir Putin remains popular despite the country’s economic difficulties because he is associated with national pride. Britain’s Prince Charles is said to have told ministers he no longer wants to be used to promote British arms sales in the Arab world, according to a new biography. That’s in the Times. And US regulators have given a Chinese insurance group the go-ahead to buy New York’s landmark Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Anbang Insurance will pay $1.95 billion for the Manhattan hotel. This is BBC News. I’m Mike Embley. The latest headlines: The Australian journalist, Peter Greste, who was freed by Egypt on Sunday, says he feels incredible angst for two of his colleagues still in prison. Ukraine’s pro-Russian rebels plan to recruit thousands more troops as fighting intensifies. The US is considering whether to arm Kiev. As we’ve been reporting, Peter Greste’s colleagues, Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy, are still injail. Mr Fahmy, who holds dual Egyptian and Canadian citizenship, has been told he could be freed if he renounces his Egyptian nationality. He has taken to Twitter to ask his followers whether they would renounce their nationality if it meant they could be freed. The first large-scale trials of an experimental vaccine against Ebola have begun in Liberia, one of three West African countries worst affected by the current outbreak. So far, the virus killed nearly 9,000 people. 27,000 volunteers will take part. Some will trial vaccines produced by the companies GSK and Merck and some will be given a placebo, effectively a dummy shot. Each vaccine uses a different virus to carry non-infectious Ebola genetic material into the body. The idea is to spark an immune response. The challenge is to reassure people there is no danger that they could become infected by taking part. Our correspondent Mark Doyle reports now from Liberia. The first-ever large-scale Ebola vaccine trial. At one point last year, there were fears Ebola might spread from West Africa throughout the world. But today, a Liberian man led the way in what may be part of a solution. I am the first to take it. I am the first person to take it. You are number one? Iam number one. I wanted to be in the lead. So others can follow. just as important is sharing information with the local population. These community health workers will track the volunteers who have been vaccinated, monitoring their health, trying to build trust. The way this vaccine works is that they introduce into the body a tiny bit of the Ebola virus. But the key thing the doctors say here is that tiny bit of the virus, although it tricks the body into thinking it can fight against Ebola, cannot give Ebola. It’s impossible. Nurses dressed in full protective gear still treat Ebola patients in Liberia. The number of Ebola cases has now dropped considerably. And for these scientists, including the most senior Liberian involved, there is now some hope. A small country on the west coast of Africa is making a difference in terms of making a significant contribution to global health. The fall in the number of Ebola cases is undoubtedly good news. And parts of the largest Ebola treatment centre in the world are being pulled down and burned. If the vaccine trial goes well too, it may well be possible to say that the end of West Africa’s Ebola nightmare is in sight. Mark Doyle, BBC News, Liberia. Former rap mogul Suge Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder. It comes after he struck two men with his pick-up truck, one of whom died. Prosecutors claim Knight meant to run them over after an argument in Los Angeles. His lawyer says it was accidental as he tried to escape a vicious attack. He turned himself in to police on Friday. Our correspondent, Peter Bowes, is in Los Angeles. There are two distinctive sides to the story. It happened towards the end of last week. He was in a car park at a fast food restaurant in Compton to the south of Los Angeles, and according to Suge Knight’s lawyer, he was trying to escape from the scene because, as he said, he had attacked. The story from prosecutors is that Suge Knight was trying to injure these two men he had apparently been arguing with, and as the charges are, he is accused of attempted murder and murder, and two counts of hit-and-run. A murky situation. Clearly, the details will unravel as this moves its way through the court system. Hip-hop and rap music thrives on a bad reputation. Everybody needs to have one, whether it is real or not, but he does have quite the background, Suge Knight. Yes. His company was called death Row records, very successful towards the end of the last decade. And who was responsible for some big names. At the other side of the story with him is that he was in and out ofjail, in and out of trouble, scrapes with the law, he was currently facing a robbery charge stemming from allegedly stealing a camera from a member of the celebrity paparazzi in Beverly Hills. Not that long ago, he was injured himself in a nightclub shooting in Los Angeles. This is a man who has seen the inside of a jail cell and has had lots of brushes with the law. What happens next, Peter? There will be a court appearance on Tuesday, when he will face his first appearance, the arraignment, where he will have an opportunity to issue a plea. We understand from his lawyer that he denies the charge. This’ll be the first time for him to face a judge himself in a court room. In the meantime, he is still injail because his bail has been revoked. Initially set at a couple of million dollars, the authorities say that he is a potential flight risk and they are concerned that he may not turn UP are concerned that he may not turn up in court if he is given his freedom now. They are also concerned about possible intimidation of witnesses. Thank you. Now for a story of treasures hidden in plain sight. Two bronze statues that have long been dismissed as minor works of art could in fact be by Michelangelo. The pair were identified from a tiny detail in a drawing which is 500 years old. If the claim proves true, they would be the only surviving Michelangelo bronzes in the world. Our arts editor Will Gompertz has the details. Two idealised naked male figures sit astride a couple of snarling panthers. The modelling is superb, the compositions elegant. These are bronze sculptures of the highest quality, but who did them? Art historians have been arguing about that for over 100 years. No longer, maybe. Academics at Cambridge University think they have found the answer. We’ve got some fantastic new Michelangelos, which we firmly believe on an aggregate of evidence - visual, technical and anatomical - to be early works by Michelangelo from 1586 to 1608. That means the 30-year-old Michelangelo would have produced them after carving his sculpture of David, but before starting work on painting the Sistine Chapel. To say these two pieces are by Michelangelo is a very big and significant claim. It would make them the only two known bronze sculptures in the world by the great Renaissance master. So, what’s their evidence? This is Exhibit A: a drawing they happened upon, showing a male figure on a panther. It’s not by Michelangelo, but it is a direct copy from him. Then there are the stylistic similarities between the way Michelangelo depicted certain physical details in his marble carvings, the anatomical accuracy of his drawings and the representation of both in the bronzes. Finally, there is the appliance of science, where they had specialist X-rays taken which have dated the works to a time that backs up their claim, but will it be supported by the wider academic community? What tends to happen is either that they’re fairly, almost surprisingly quickly accepted and become part of the great canon of art, or they’re equally swiftly forgotten, and three minutes later, nobody remembers them at all. If they are by Michelangelo, their value would rocket well above the £1.8 million a private collector reportedly paid for them in 2002, and a new chapter would open on the extraordinary legacy of a great Italian artist. Will Gompertz, BBC News, Cambridge. Now to a different kind of culture. The groundhog in Wisconsin has offered a very painful prediction. Following tradition, the town of Sun Prairie in Wisconsin in the USA asked a groundhog to forecast whether winter will last another six weeks. But when the rodent was lifted close to the mayor’s ear, well, let’sjust say he got a rather nasty surprise. Some have speculated that the bite was a gentle correction because the mayor had misinterpreted the forecast. Six more weeks of winter has been predicted. I have a sense of deja vu. A reminder of our headlines: the Australianjournalist headlines: the Australian journalist Peter Greste headlines: the Australianjournalist Peter Greste says he is relieved to have been freed from an Egyptian jail but feels incredible angst at leaving two of his colleagues behind. He spent more than 400 days of a seven-year sentence. They were all accused of helping the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Peter Greste says if it is right for him to be free, it is right for all of them to be free. There are still 20 journalists injail in Egypt, most of them Egyptian. Plenty of information online. Thank you for watching. Definitely so signs of spring this week. We will stay with the cold weather including tonight, with ice and snow showers around. We are seeing significant snow work its way southwards across England and the Midlands. Drifting down across Scotland and Northern Ireland, outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow. A bit ofa A bit of a mix of conditions, certainly near the coast. As we move inland, they could fall potentially as snow, giving a further light covering in a few places. Widespread frost to start, however. These are the temperatures in the larger towns and cities, so in the countryside, there will be a really hard frost. Across Northern Ireland, we are back to that mix of rain, sleet and snow and some of that snow could cause a few problems here, more especially across northern Scotland, especially over the higher ground here. across northern Scotland, especially overthe higher ground here. Forthe bulk of Scotland, it is a very cold and frosty start with the occasional pocket of fog to throw in the mix. Through the day, no major changes, although showers will fade across Northern Ireland. They will head south across Scotland, reaching the Grampians. Further south, temperatures lift a little bit through the day, turning more into rain and sleet, those showers. It will feel even cooler than the temperatures suggest in the wind. As we go through Tuesday night and into Wednesday, this area of high pressure will begin to topple in, changing things a little bit. It won’t change the overnight temperatures, mind you.

Stilla mix of drifting south across the east of England. Still a mix of rain, England. Stilla mix of rain, sleet and snow in many places. Lighter winds as you go further north and west. Not feeling too bad in the sunshine. Five degrees in Northern Ireland, for example. That wind is beginning to set in for the latter part of the week. Very noticeable for most of us on Thursday. A largely bright story, however, with fairly cloudy skies. That is how we set up for the latter part of the week. High pressure across the north of the UK but pulling in some cold easterly winds.

Home owners HOITIE OWFIEFS i’IOpâ. central bank cut interest rates in the next hour? And worrying times for Bangladesh’s garment industry as political unrest cost lives and tens of millions of dollars. Hello and welcome to Asia Business Report. I’m Rico Hizon. Injust underan hourwas’ Injust under an hour was’ time, Australia will be making an announcement on interest rate policy and many expect the reserve bank to make a cut. -- hours’ time. That would be good news for homeowners but also an indication that the economy, which has had decades of unbroken end of-- economic expansion, has hit a sluggish patch. Australia’s economy has been the envy of the Western world in recent years. But now the mining boom, which fuelled the government’s offers, has come to an end.-- which fuelled the government’s offers, has come to an end. -- which filled. And the price of the war materials has collapsed. There is a lack of momentum and confidence is low. So, many are looking for a rate cut for faster economic growth. While close to 70% of Australians own their own home and more than half of them are still paying off the bank loan they used to buy it. Lower rates mean lower repayments and in theory more cash in the pocket to spend on other things that help keep the economy moving. But in Australia it’s not that simple, there are risks. Rates are already at historical lows. Homeowners may well decide not to spend the extra money they get from any rate cut, but instead to pay more off their mortgage. Also home prices are at record highs, leading to worries that a rate reduction could create a bubble in the housing market. And it’s not all about the economy. To add to the challenges, there is a backdrop of political uncertainty, with questions about the future of Prime Minister Tony Abbott. He is under pressure from inside his own party. Pulling the economic levers is never simple. Earlier I spoke to Shane Oliver, chief economist in Sydney, and asked about the likelihood of a rate cut announced today. They should cut and I have a slightly to Ben Cutting. I think they will cut. -- a slight lead that they will cut. But the economy is sluggish and inflation is low. If they don’t cut the Australian dollar will probably go up, that they can always decide to wait another month and do it in March. Others believe they should not cut, because this died in petrol prices is like a de facto tax cut, putting more money in consumer’s pockets. It is certainly doing that. Household incomes in Australia, from the petrol price drop, and relatively strong house prices. But Australia has had a big hit to national income, as energy prices have come down on the back of the oil price fall and the iron ore price has collapsed, which affects tax revenue, leading to possible further government austerity down the track. If you compare Australia to Canada, Canada has cut and the case remains for Australia to do the same. If they don’t cut in this February meeting could they cut in the next meeting in March? They certainly could. One argument against the cut today is that the reserve bank said in December that they see stability in interest rates has been prudent. They may decide they want to drop that line, which has been in a statement from the reserve bank for the past year or so, ahead of the in March. That is a possibility. But do think it’s either today or in March and the key is interest rates are coming down in Australia. If they don’t cut in February how much of it would be a disappointment to the markets? I think it would be a big disappointment for the markets. The Aussie sharemarket has risen strongly today and if I’m not mistaken it’s just gone to a new post global financial crisis higher. That was this morning. The Aussie sharemarket has been boosted by expectation for a cut and the Australian dollar has fallen below 78 cents, US, on expectations for a cut. If we don’t see a move today we will probably see a sharp rebound in the value of the Aussie dollar and a decline in the value of the Aussie sharemarket. Profits for the technology giant Lenovo in the last quarter were down, but it has beaten estimates. The revenue for the three months until December was up to 30%. Originally a PC any factor Lenovo moved into mobile phones by buying motor roller. They now account for one quarter of its business. In Macau, they have reported an eight month of declining casino revenues as a corruption crackdown continues to bring in big spenders from the mainland. The former Portuguese colonies says year-on-year revenues fell almost 17.5% to $3 billion. This week companies from across the spectrum of the japanese economy will be publishing their earnings reports. japan is starting to show some signs that it might be coming out of recession. The japanese yen is low, oil is cheap and the US market is growing. So are japan’s global players able to capitalise on this? Basically all trends in japan Basically all trends injapan are positive. We had a recession before but corporate incomes are growing. We have low import costs, low currency, so very supportive selling prices. We other domestic economy supported by monetary policies and fiscal policies. Companies are earning money and those companies getting punished right now is basically because their results are good at not strong enough. Is this an indication then that the japanese economy will pull out of its recession in the October-December quarter? We can’t be quite sure about that. When we look at what the companies are already doing in terms of incomes, in particular in terms of profit growth, during a period that was tricky on a micro level, we can be very optimistic for the current quarter and for this year in terms of earning growth and also in terms of overall strategies of japanese companies. If he is -- if this is the case could we see positive growth for the japanese economy in the next financial year, starting in April? I’m quite positive on that. We still have very sceptical forecasts in many ways. positive on that. We still have very scepticalforecasts in many ways. A lot of that is related to the global environment. The US economy has been pulling japan, in particular the exporter is, but now the outlook for the US is good, but not as strong as before. -- exporters. We have some concerns about the outlook in China and Asia but overall the domestic market is very strong. We see this with companies owning their money domestically. We have a stronghold here and that’s helping the tremendously. The garment industry in Bangladesh says it has lost at least $56 million since the start of the year, due to political unrest. More than 40 people have died in the violence. And the dash is one of the world’s against garment exporters and business leaders are worried. This 22-year-old is busy making clothes for Western retailers. The garment industry is Bangladesh’s named exporter but it is going through a tough time. At the turn of the year the prime on a star was called on to step down. When she refused, they called for a nationwide blockade. -- Prime Minister. Factories remain open in the capital but it is difficult to move goods due to the violence. TRANSLATION: Transport is the main problem. A seaport is 300 kilometres away. It is very difficult to transport goods during the blockade. Al-Shabab has dropped by 40%. Many factory owners don’t want to take risks. -- owl shipment. We want this blockade to end. So does the transport sector. It loses $6 million a day in the current unrest. All these trucks are stuck at the depot because the country’s major highways have been blocked for weeks. Testers have torched more than 500 vehicles. Even trucks carrying essential items, like vegetables, rice and sugar. -- protesters. TRANSLATION: I don’t want to drive my truck on the highway, it’s too dangerous. I’m scared because a few drivers have been burnt to death. The crisis is also hitting people in their pockets, as food prices have gone up. This market is full of fruit and vegetables but it has become more difficult to get supplies in. Political crisis and blockades are nothing new in Bangladesh but the rising death toll has caused fear. Business leaders are calling on the government and opposition to solve their differences peacefully at the negotiating table, rather than on the streets. Before we go, a look at the markets. Most Asian stocks are relatively subcutaneous in Tuesday trade as investors wait to see whether Australia’s central bank will announce an interest rate cut to help shore up economic growth. We see the gains of the Sydney benchmark index trending to just 13 points higher, 250 600. The Nikkei has turned from positive to negative, now lower by 65 points.

The recent cuts in energy bills could have been much bigger. That’s according to the consumer group Which?. It claims households should have saved an average of £145 last year. The research, which is to be published later today, suggests that energy firms should now be cutting gas and electricity prices by as much as 10%. Our industry correspondent john Moylan has been looking at the figures. In the energy world, these are turbulent times. For the past year, wholesale prices have been falling, but are households across Britain really feeling the benefit? Pensioner Richard Langdon keeps an eye on his bills. As a British Gas customer, his tariff will fall by 5% at the end of February. He thinks that is too little, too late. It has to be nonsense, because wholesale prices have dropped quite a lot and there is no reason for the industry they are in not to drop the price for the consumer. Which? compared how the suppliers buy energy and compared that with much they charge all of us for it. It found that savings of £145 on a standard dual fuel bill could have been passed on to households last year. That amounts to total savings of £2.9 billion right across Britain. And it says that there is room for further cuts to gas and electricity prices of up to 10% in the year ahead. The mismatch between wholesale energy costs and the price we all pay on our bill has been big, and growing steadily. There is no excuse for any supplier not to pass through these savings to their customers, unless we have an energy market that is not working competitively. The suppliers don’t agree. They say that the energy we are using today may have been bought a few years ago. They do this to secure supplies, to keep the lights on, and to shield households from volatile prices. You can’t suddenly pass the savings on in one chunk. It is only as your buying strategy unwinds, and you as you can actually take advantage of these new, lower wholesale prices that you can pass those on to your customers. Do you believe that the price cuts we have seen recently really reflect what has been going on in the wholesale markets? Yes, I think that is a fair reflection. As prices are falling, as companies can actually afford to pass those savings on, they are doing so. The energy market is now in the midst of a major competition investigation, that should tell us once and for all whether the price we pay for energy is fair. john Moylan, BBC News. You can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. I’m @BBC Mike Embley. Time for all the sports news in Sport Today. I’m john Watson and this is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up on this programme: Chelsea’s new $40 million man - the biggest move on transfer deadline day. Europe’s transfer window closes. And the LA Galaxy are back in familiar surroundings at the White House. return home to a snowy reception in Boston . English Premier League leaders Chelsea were the busiest of Europe’s top clubs as the january transfer window closed on Monday. They concluded a $40 million deal as many of their rivals avoided the last-minute scramble for players that Transfer Deadline Day is famous for. With news on that transfer and details of all the other big moves injanuary, here’s our football reporter, john Bennett. Two players out and one player in the Chelsea. juan Cuadrado has moved to Stamford Bridge. One of the stars of the Colombian side during the World Cup. Rodriguez was their best but this one was not far behind. 26 years old and playing for Fiorentina, could he be the difference in the English Premier League? I can tell you that he is delighted to move to Stamford Bridge. He has been on social media since signing. He also posted a picture of Stamford Bridge as well. He cannot wait until East debut. The other player going out is Mohammed Salah as well as Andre Schurrle, who fell out of favour with jose Mourhinho. He has moved to Wolfsburg in Germany, who are second in the Bundesliga. They will be very pleased to have a world champion in their team. This is their reaction on social media. I mentioned Mohammed Salah. He has gone to Fiorentina in a light like swap. To be honest, it was a bit quiet on deadline day. Lukas Podolski was one of the first. Arsenal to inter- Milan. Inter- Milan have completely reshaped their squad. Victor Valdes, the former Barcelona goalkeeper has joined Manchester United. He was out of contract, so it is a free transfer. Another transfer to inter- Milan, the Bayern Munich International, who fell in -- out of favour. The biggest move ofjanuary is Wilfried Bony moving from Swansea to Manchester City. Another player who could have an effect on the title race. And what about this man? 16 years old, he has signed for Real Madrid. So many clubs are chasing him. Lucas Silver is another move to Real Madrid. The Champions League winners are hoping to regain the trophy in the second half of the city. One move from Manchester to Roma. We expected that and the move is now permanent after being on loan to them. And Gabrielle Paulista has moved from Villarreal to Arsenal as they look to strengthen their defence. Not all moves, however, have done well. Samuel to was signed -- Samuel Eto’o was signed a number of weeks ago but he is now reported to have skipped East training session on Monday. There he is. It was a double training session and he did not want to train twice, so he went back to his home in Milan and there are already rumours he could be leaving his club. One rumour to follow over the next few days. Ghana’s head coach, Avram Grant, has criticised what he called the career-threatening tackle which looks likely to keep his captain, Asamoah Gyan, out of Thursday’s Africa Cup of Nations semifinal. The Black Stars forward injured his hip when he was fouled in stoppage time by Guinea goalkeeper, Naby Yattara, who was red-carded for the offence. His manager believes that the player must be banned for the challenge. What happened with this goalkeeper, what you did to Asamoah, I think this is an opportunity to be tough on everybody to show how they protect the players. To do that deliberately... It was a few centimetres down and I can tell you if that were so, he will not play for a very long time. I think that they have to take a decision and display should be banned for a long, long time. First, it is a bad injury. Second, if you do it at the last minute, it means you do not respect the game . One player who will be making a landmark appearance on the field on Wednesday is the former England captain, Steven Gerrard. When he steps out against Bolton in their FA Cup fourth-round replay, he’ll be making his 700th Liverpool appearance. To put it in context, only two players have featured more times for the club. Having cemented his reputation as one of the club’s all-time greats, manager Brendan Rodgers paid tribute to his contribution, as the player prepares to leave his boyhood club to join the LA Galaxy at the end of the season. It is an incredible achievement, as I have said before, and I’m sure it won’t happen again at this club. The remarkable player and to know him as well as that is the other advantage we have in seeing his rationalism as a player. -- is professionalism. It’s notjust him in the game, it is in his life. He has wonderful talent and wonderful ability but he lives his life for the game and, asl and wonderful ability but he lives his life for the game and, as I said before, he is unique.

Less than 24 hours after winning the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots have returned home to Boston. And you can see just how much snow has fallen. They were victorious against the Seattle Seahawks in Arizona. Their victory parade has been postponed until Wednesday because of that weather. Fans are calling it one of the best Super Bowl match as ever, with that dramatic sequence of play in the last few minutes. The star quarterback, Tom Brady, agrees. We have been on the other end of some great catches and not been able to finish it out, and this time, we made the play. There was no fight. Nobody lost confidence on defence. There was a lot of fight that the team had. 99 yards on the football field and we did. It is a great feeling.

He was speaking as he showed off his sister Australian Open trophy on the banks of the Yarra River, 24 hours after defeating Andy Murray. -- as he showed off his fifth Australian Open trophy. Novak Djokovic appeared to suffer from cramp, distracting Andy Murray, leading to speculation that he had faked his injuries.

We will see you soon. Definitely no hint of spring as yet. We are stuck in the winter mode for the foreseeable future. Frost and snow over the next few days. Everything becoming slow-moving for a while, with little areas of low pressure drifting south across the UK and raping some snow showers across the north of Scotland and Northern Ireland. -- draping. Falling as sleet and rain across the coast but snow inland. Widespread frost to start with, however. These are the temperatures in the larger towns and cities, so the rural spots will start with 96 degrees or minus eight degrees and a really hard frost. -- minus six degrees. Snow could cause a few problems here and there, most significantly across northern Scotland over the high ground, but for the bulk of Scotland, it isjust a very ground, but for the bulk of Scotland, it is just a very cold and frosty start with the occasional pocket of fog maybe throw in to the mix. No major changes through the day. However, those showers will fade away across Northern Ireland. Show is getting into the Grampians, bringing a further covering of snow to the higher ground here. Further south, temperatures will lift slightly, showers turning more to rain or sleet. But as high as the temperatures do get, it will still feel colder than that in the wind. As we go through Tuesday night and into Wednesday, this area of high pressure begins to topple in, changing things a little bit. It won’t change the overnight temperatures very much, mind you, with a hard frost in most places outside of the larger towns and cities. A very cold start to the day on Wednesday. Showers drifting down the eastern side of England but still that mix of rain, sleet and snow in many places. That wind will have quite an edge to it as well, blowing in from the north. Lighter winds as you go further north and west. Not too bad in the sunshine. Five degrees on the east coast of Northern Ireland, for example. That eastern and north-easterly wind is beginning to set in for the latter part of the week. Very noticeable for most of us on Thursday. A largely dry story, however, with fairly cloudy skies. And that is how we set up for the latter part of the week, high-pressure pulling in across the UK. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. I’m Mike Embley. Our top stories: Australian journalist Peter Greste says he’s relieved to be free, but feels ""incredible angst"" for his two colleagues still in prison in Egypt. Amidst this relief, I still feel a sense of concern and worry because if it’s appropriate and right for me to be free... Then it’s right for all of them to be free. Ukraine’s pro-Russian rebels plan to recruit thousands more troops. As fighting intensifies, the US considers arming Kiev. After a fatal hit-and-run accident, former rap mogul ‘Suge’ Knight is charged with murder. And they’ve been overlooked for 500 years, but these two bronze since statues may be priceless masterpieces by Michelangelo. Hello. The release of a second Aljazeera journalist from an Egyptian jail is imminent, according to Canada’s Foreign Minister. It’s just a day since the Australian journalist Peter Greste was freed, more than 400 days into a seven-year sentence. He has spoken of his anguish at having to leave behind his two colleagues, the Egyptianjournalist Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy, who has dual Egyptian-Canadian citizenship. All were accused of helping the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Orla Guerin reports. After a year behind bars with his Aljazeera colleagues, Peter Greste can now look forward to covering news, not making it, and to being reunited with his family. In his first interview, he explained how the nightmare ended. The prison warden called me over and told me that, you know, it’s time to pack your stuff. I said, what do you mean? He said, you’re going. Isaid, well, where? To another prison? No, the embassy is coming, they will be here in an hour. Get your stuff and go. And I can’t tell you that real mix of emotions that was boiling inside. His happiness tempered by anxiety about producers Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who are still prisoners. Amidst all of this relief, I still feel a sense of concern, and a real sense of worry, because if it’s appropriate for me, if it’s right for me to be free, then it’s right for all of them to be free. But his colleagues are not the only ones waiting forjustice. While the Aljazeera case has generated huge interest abroad, there are otherjournalists injail in Egypt, getting little or no attention. The journalists’ union here says nearly 20 reporters and photographers remain behind bars. They are all Egyptians and relatives fear that without foreign pressure they could be forgotten. It seems Shokan Abu Zeid already has been. He has spent 530 days injail without charge. His brother Mohammed tells me he was arrested covering the violent dispersal of a Muslim Brotherhood sit-in. He says prison is taking his health and his spirit. We expected he might die doing hisjob, he says. We would have accepted that. But for him to die every day, that is hard for us. As Peter Greste savours freedom, the judge who jailed him has issued another verdict. He confirmed death sentences for 183 men convicted of killing policemen during Islamist riots. Critics say, once again, Egyptianjustice is in the dock. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Cairo. Peter Greste’s law you joined us from Australia. This is a mixed blessing for him? It is. As you heard Peter Sagan we are delighted that he is out. -- Peter say. And Peter is relieved. But we are anxious for the release of his colleagues. In theory he faces a retrial. Could he be arrested in Australia? There’s no basis, as an Australian Loye, as we understand that could lead to Peter being arrested in Australia. -- lawyer. There could be no charges under Australian law, as far as we are aware, that could be laid against Peter at all. How information is indeed that he will be free, that he is free now, and will remain free when he arrives in Australia. And you don’t expect him to ever face trial in Egypt? We don’t expect that is the case. Obviously we are still waiting for paperwork from Egypt, in order to be able to definitively determine what his legal status is in Egypt. Our understanding is, as I’ve said and we are confident, that there’s no additionaljudicial process to be undertaken in Australia. Second, we are seeking to determine that there should be no additionaljudicial process in Egypt as well. How was he treated? In jail? Yes. I’ll let Peter talk about how he was treated in jail. What we want to talk about at the moment is that he is tremendously relieved. He is obviously, as you saw, in high spirits. What I think comes to me and comes to mind when I think about having dealt with him and his family during this process is how he maintained tremendously high spirits during that time injail and it’s a testament to him and his character, that he was able to get on and have such a wonderful interview last night. As he said, if it’s right for me to be free, it’s right for all of us to be free. What can he do to help his colleagues? In many ways he has already done a lot, simply by being himself and by maintaining his line, which we all completely agree with, that he and his colleagues should never have been charged and should never have been incarcerated for the crimes that they are alleged to have committed. So I think that you will see that Peter will remain very supportive of Mohamed Fahmy’s case and Palmer Mahmud’s case and we look forward to assisting them. Of course 20 reporters and photographers are still in jail course 20 reporters and photographers are still injail in Egypt. All of them Egyptian. Their cases are much less high profile. Yes and of course the basis upon which Peter has been released from jail under Egyptian law relates specifically to foreigners. And so Peter and hopefully the other two... All reports suggest it is progressing. The basis upon which they’ve been released relates to them being foreigners. But as you said there are many other people in jail, journalists, and we hope there will be the chance for them to challenge their incarceration and seek freedom as soon as possible. We flick, Wendy weeks the timber? We don’t know yet. Peter obviously has been through quite an ordeal and he is at the moment undertaking, as you can understand, rest and relaxation in Cyprus and once he is ready to get on a plane and come back to Australia we know he will, to be with his family. We know his brother Mike is there with him in Cyprus now. We look forward to his return, as soon as he is able to do it, and obviously we look forward to when he is ready to pick up his pen again and getting back to doing what he loves. Thank you for giving us your time. A senior White House official has signalled that President Obama may be considering sending weapons to help the Ukrainian military. So far the US has so far only supplied non-lethal aid to Ukraine’s government, which has been battling pro-Russian separatists since April. As the conflict drags on, the Moscow- backed rebels say they plan to recruit more fighters, to bring their numbers up to 100,000. In the past nine months, more than 5,000 people have been killed and january has been one of the deadliest months. The separatists are trying to capture the town of Debaltseve from government forces, a crucial railhead linking the two main rebel-held cities, Donetsk and Luhansk. David Stern reports from Kiev. Ukrainian artillery pounds separatist positions in the country’s east. This footage was recorded recently near the strategic railroad hub of Debaltseve. In the past week, fierce fighting has gripped the region. Kiev officials say their forces are holding out against a rebel offensive. Russian-backed militants, seen here, say they have surrounded the pro-Kiev troops in Debaltseve, and are tightening the noose. On Monday, the rebels said they would boost their forces to 100,000 fighters. Where they would recruit so many men was not clear. Kiev and Western leaders fear the separatists will launch, with Russian assistance, a full-scale attack. The rebels say this move is defensive. TRANSLATION: We plan to form at least five additional brigades. Three motorised rifle brigades, an artillery brigade, and a tank brigade. This is the reserve which will guarantee us the ability to withstand any attack and, in case of success, to develop counter-attacks. In the West, calls are increasing to arm Kiev, to withstand the militants’ offensive. Up until now, Europe and the United States have provided non-lethal aid, like body armour. But resistance to provide the Ukrainians with weapons is still strong. TRANSLATION: Germany will not support Ukraine with weapons. It is my firm belief that this conflict cannot be solved militarily. Therefore we insist that on one hand we will impose sanctions if necessary. We have done that jointly with Europe. And, on the other hand, we will use all diplomatic means to resolve this conflict through talks. As the fighting escalates, civilians are coming under heavy fire. Untold numbers have been killed or wounded. Others, like these people, have found refuge in hastily established camps. No-one knows when they will be able to go home, or if they will have a home to return to. A tax crackdown on the overseas profits of US companies such as Apple and Microsoft is at the heart of the 2016 budget, now formally unveiled by President Obama. It proposes a one-off 14% levy on foreign income stashed away by American corporations, raising $238 billion and a 19% tax on their future foreign earnings. The budget now faces months of wrangling with a Republican-controlled Congress, which would also increase taxes for the wealthiest individuals, with the aim of helping the middle classes. Mr Obama said it was time to end what he called ""mindless austerity"" and the growing American economy allowed scope for more fairness. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well or will we build an economy where everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead? That was the focus of my address a couple of weeks ago, what I called middle-class economics. The idea that this country does best when everybody gets a fair shot and everybody’s doing their fair share and plays by the same rules. The budget that Congress now has in its hands is built on those values. The first large-scale trials of an experimental vaccine against Ebola have begun in Liberia, one of three West African countries worst affected by the current outbreak. So far the virus killed nearly 9,000 people. 27,000 volunteers will take part. Some will trial vaccines produced by the companies GSK and Merck, and some will be given a placebo, effectively a dummy shot. Each vaccine uses a different virus to carry non-infectious Ebola genetic material into the body. The idea is to spark an immune response. The challenge is to reassure people there is no danger that they could become infected by taking part. Our correspondent Mark Doyle reports now from Liberia. The first ever large-scale Ebola vaccine trial. At one point last year, there were fears Ebola might spread from West Africa throughout the world. Today, a Liberian man led the way, in what may be part of a solution. I am the first to take it. I am the first person to take it. You are number one? Iam number one. I wanted to be in the lead. So others can follow. just as important is sharing information with the local population. These community health workers will track the volunteers who have been vaccinated, monitoring their health, trying to build trust. The way this vaccine works is that they introduce into the body a tiny bit of the Ebola virus. But the key thing the doctors say here is that tiny bit of the virus, although it tricks the body into thinking it can fight against Ebola, cannot give Ebola. It’s impossible. Nurses dressed in full protective gear still treat Ebola patients in Liberia. The number of Ebola cases has now dropped considerably. And for these scientists, including the most senior Liberian involved, there is now some hope. A small country on the West Coast of Africa is making a difference The fall in the number of Ebola cases is undoubtedly good news. And parts of the largest Ebola treatment centre in the world are being pulled down and burned. If the vaccine trial goes well too, it may well be possible to say that the end of West Africa’s Ebola nightmare is in sight. Mark Doyle, BBC News, Liberia. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: The second snowstorm in a week hits the US, causing at least seven deaths across the Midwest and north-east. Let’s round up the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to give the japanese military a mandate to evacuate japanese nationals from crises overseas following the murder of two japanese hostages. That’s in the japan Times. The New York Times reports that last month’s terror attacks in Paris have prompted a debate on whether French national identity excludes Muslims. The Moscow Times quotes analysts as saying President Vladimir Putin remains popular despite the country’s economic difficulties because he is associated with national pride. Britain’s Prince Charles is said to have told ministers he no longer wants to be used to promote British arms sales in the Arab world, according to a new biography. That’s in the Times. And US regulators have given a Chinese insurance group the go-ahead to buy New York’s landmark Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Anbang Insurance will pay $1.95 billion for the Manhattan hotel. This is BBC News. The latest headlines: The Australian journalist, Peter Greste, who was freed by Egypt on Sunday, says he feels incredible angst for two of his colleagues still in prison. Ukraine’s pro-Russian rebels plan to recruit thousands more troops. As fighting intensifies, the US is considering whether to arm Kiev. Former rap mogul Suge Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder. It seems he struck two men with his pick-up truck in Los Angeles. One of them died. Prosecutors claim Knight meant to run them over after an argument. His lawyer says it was accidental, that he was trying to escape a vicious attack. Tanya Hart is host of the syndicated radio show, Hollywood Live with Tanya Hart. She joins us now from Los Angeles. Well, actually, we have a long history with Suge Knight that goes all the way back to the 1980s, really, when he started out in this business as Bobby Brown’s bodyguard, believe it or not. Fast forward to where we are today and Suge Knight, unfortunately, has always been around crime related incidents. He has a long rap sheet himself. He is now eligible for what we call the three strikes law. That means, if he is convicted and sentenced, more than likely, he will go to jail for life because that is the way the law reads. I do know that he claims that he was being attacked by three or four men when this happened. He was shot six times back in the summer. He says he was weak from that and was being beaten up by these men and took off as soon as he had the chance was top I have not seen a single mark or scratch on him in the pictures as he turned himself in to the police as this incident happened. We are not sure where those alleged people are who were supposedly beating him up. We have no idea who they are or where they are. We do know that one person is dead and another person is injured. As you say, his legal position is tricky even without this. He served five years injail for tricky even without this. He served five years in jail for violating probation on assault charges. He has had the misfortune of being around a lot of trouble. A lot of trouble for a very, very long time. He was with Tupac shock or when he was shot and killed. -- was with Tupac when he was shot and killed. He has been there a couple of times when that happened. Recently, he was shot six times, and then he had to leave the hospital to go to court for another incident that took place last year. He was actually scheduled to go to court tomorrow for that incident and now, of course, he has a murder rap pending. Success in hip-hop and rap is pretty much dependent on having a bad reputation, whether it is real or not, but in this case, there really has been quite a lot of heavy stuff. And part of what we are seeing here is that he and Doctor dre started out together. Doctor dre has become the first billionaire coming out of the hip-hop world. Here, of course, has changed his life like so many people have you came out of that hole Death Row Records. He and Snoop Dogg. They are in the good life, quite frankly. And Suge Knight is seemingly stuck in a time warp really feels like he has to be a bad guy. He was always a strong arming these people, and that is how he got them to do what he wanted them to do. But times have changed. Huge swathes of the US have been covered by snow after a massive winter storm. In Boston, the Super Bowl parade has been postponed. It was not as though they needed any more snow in Massachusetts and even more has fallen in the second winter storm in less than a week. We thought we were getting off easy but then we had this blizzard and it sounds like there is more to come. When it starts happening like this, you have to get ready for it and get plenty of gas for the snowplough and get some shovels and hot chocolate. We are all set. In Boston, another foot of snow has fallen. It has caused disruption to thousands of flights. The New England Patriots were able to get home after their victory at the Super Bowl but the weather has put the celebrations on hold. Their victory parade has been postponed until Wednesday. The disruption caused by the storm has been felt across the north-east of the US. Chicago saw one of the heaviest snowfalls in record for February. Treacherous road conditions caused a serious pileup, closing a main highway for several hours. February the second is Groundhog Day. Crowds turned out in Pennsylvania to see the famous Punxsutawney Phil supposedly was his weather prediction for the next six weeks. He apparently saw his shadow, which means no early spring. Meanwhile, one city mayor in Wisconsin got more than a prediction. In Detroit, like in other places, many schools and businesses were shut. Hardly any cast to be seen on the streets of America’s motor city. Winter storm warnings were in place for part of Boston, Maine and New York state, as the north-east of America remains in this icy grip. Now for a story of treasures hidden in plain sight. Two bronze statues that have long been dismissed as minor works of art could in fact be by Michelangelo. The pair were identified from a tiny detail in a drawing which is 500 years old. If the claim proves true, they would be the only surviving Michelangelo bronzes in the world. Our arts editor, Will Gompertz, has the details. Two idealised naked male figures sit astride a couple of snarling panthers. The modelling is superb, the compositions elegant. These are bronze sculptures of the highest quality, but who did them? Art historians have been arguing about that for over 100 years. No longer, maybe. Academics at Cambridge University think they have found the answer. We’ve got some fantastic new Michelangelos, which we firmly believe on an aggregate of evidence - visual, technical and anatomical - to be early works by Michelangelo from 1586 to 1608. That means the 30-year-old Michelangelo would have produced them after carving his sculpture of David, but before starting work on painting the Sistine Chapel. To say these two pieces are by Michelangelo is a very big and significant claim. It would make them the only two known bronze sculptures in the world by the great Renaissance master. So, what’s their evidence? This is Exhibit A: a drawing they happened upon, showing a male figure on a panther. It’s not by Michelangelo, but it is a direct copy from him. Then there are the stylistic similarities between the way Michelangelo depicted certain physical details in his marble carvings, the anatomical accuracy of his drawings and the representation of both in the bronzes. Finally, there is the appliance of science, where they had specialist X-rays taken which have dated the works to a time that backs up their claim, but will it be supported by the wider academic community? What tends to happen is either that they’re fairly, almost surprisingly quickly accepted and become part of the great canon of art, or they’re equally swiftly forgotten, and three minutes later, nobody remembers them at all. If they are by Michelangelo, their value would rocket well above the £1.8 million a private collector reportedly paid for them in 2002, and a new chapter would open on the extraordinary legacy of a great Italian artist. Will Gompertz, BBC News, Cambridge. And we will let you know!

Everything becoming slow-moving for a while, with little areas of low pressure drifting south across the UK and draping some snow showers across the north of Scotland and Northern Ireland. More as sleet and rain along the coast. But potentially falling as snow inland, giving a further light covering in a few places. Widespread frost to start with, however. These are the temperatures in the larger towns and cities, so the rural spots will start with minus six or minus eight degrees and a really hard frost.

Australia’s central bank has cut interest rates by a quarter of a %. And worrying times for Bangladesh’s garment industry, as political unrest costs lives and tens of millions of dollars. Hello and welcome to Asia Business Report. I’m Rico Hizon. In Newsjust in, the Australian central bank the Reserve Bank has just announced it has cut interest rate by a quarter of 1%. The news will be welcomed by the country’s homeowners but it is also an indication the economy that have had decades of unbroken economic expansion has hit a sluggish patch. Let’s cross over to Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP capital in Sydney. We were talking about this several hours ago, that you were expecting a rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia. That’s right, and they have certainly delivered that. I must admit it was a difficult call, because they might have waited another month but in the event they have delivered and have cited the fact that we have seen patchy growth globally, weak commodity prices, and weak domestic demand in Australia. When you talk about weak commodity prices, diving petrol prices, Shane, it is also like a de facto tax cut, and a weaker Australian dollar also decreases domestic product. There will be a whole number of things which will help growth, the fall in petrol prices in Australia is putting about $19 a week in terms of savings into the average household. They are getting lower interest which I worked out is roughly equivalent to about $15 a week saving for someone on an average mortgage, and S8ViIâ1gfoI’SOTT’IâoIâ1â OI’] BI’] GVEFSQE TT’IOI’tg8gâ, and GS YOU saving for someone on an average mortgage, and as you said, the lower Australian dollar will help Australian companies and industries that have to compete in internationally like tourism, manufacturing, and so on. So yes, there is a lot of support for the Australian economy coming through. At the end of the day this is more like fine tuning. It is not that Australia has an emergency, it is about taking insurance to make sure growth picks up over the course of the next 12 months. Though you have lower oil prices, you have a weaker Australian dollar. So when will Australians start feeling the impact of this quarter point cut made by the Reserve Bankjust now? Well most of them will start to feel it in the next week or so. It is all fine for the reserve to cut but of course banks have to pass that on. I expected the next few days all of the major Australian banks will lower their mortgage interest rates, delivering a big boost to Australians with a mortgage. Likewise there will be a cut in deposit rates. And that will flow through as a loss of income to those who are relying on bank deposits. But net, it will be a boost to the economy, and Australians will start to see that next week. But there are also some fears that the rate cut will drive the already high housing market into a bubble. That is certainly a risk. We have very high house prices in Australia relative to incomes. Very strong growth in Sydney over the course of the last 18 months or so, so certainly a risk. The Reserve Bank extended up to the financial regulator, what we call APRA, to the financial regulator, what we callAPRA, going into to the financial regulator, what we call APRA, going into the property market. So that is how the Reserve Bank sees itself dealing with that. It is a regulatory issue rather than a monetary policy issue. So how long will the central bank hold before it decides to cut again? Probably a few months. My feeling is that rate cut in Australia anyway are a bit like cockroaches, when you see one of them there is usually another one. So the fact that we have seen this one gives me confidence that we will probably see another rate cut, probably by May. Thank you so much for your insights on that rate cut from the Australian central bank, now at 2.25%. Let’s get reaction from the markets and how they are faring. And it seems like investors are currently rejoicing with that interest rate cuts, which will help shore up, as mentioned by Shane earlier, on economic growth. The ASX All Ordinaries index is higher by 15 points at 5600 and it seems like investors have already digestives some of that over the past few days, and there would be a rate cut by the Reserve Bank and taking a look at how the Aussie dollar is faring after the RBA’s rate cuts, it is currently at 78.04 against the US dollar. In other business is making headlines. Profits for the technology giant Lenovo in the last quarter were down, but it has beaten estimates. The revenue for the three months until December was up to 30%. Originally a PC manufacturer, Lenovo moved into mobile phones by buying Motorola. They now account for one quarter of its business. In Macau, they have reported an eight month of declining casino revenues, as a corruption crackdown continues to bring in big spenders from the mainland. The former Portuguese colony says year-on-year revenues fell almost 17.5% to $3 billion. Last you’s annual revenue fell 46% to $44 billion. Apple will invest to build a new data centre in Phoenix, Arizona. It will be the technology company’s fifth in the US and will serve for a control centre for the other four, providing support for products such as my cloud, iTunes, and Siri. It will be one of its largest ever investment. japan is starting to show some signs that it might be coming out of recession. This week companies from across the spectrum of the japanese economy will be publishing their earnings reports. The japanese yen is low, oil is cheap, and the US market is growing. So are japan’s global players able to capitalise on this? ~ I wasjoined by Martin I was joined by Martin Schulz from the Fujitsu research Institute. Basically all trends injapan are positive. We had a recession before, but corporate incomes are growing. We have low import costs, low currency, so very supportive selling prices. We are a domestic economy supported by monetary policies and fiscal policies. Companies are earning money, and those companies getting punished right now is basically because their results are good but not strong enough at current valuation levels. Is this an indication then that the japanese economy will pull out of its recession in the October-December quarter? We can’t be quite sure about that. When we look at what the companies are already doing in terms of incomes, in particular in terms of profit growth, during a period that was tricky on a micro level, we can be very optimistic for the current quarter and for this year in terms of earning growth, and also in terms of overall strategies of japanese companies. So if this is the case, could we see positive growth for the japanese economy in the next financial year, starting in April? I’m quite positive on that. We still have very sceptical forecasts in many ways. A lot of that is related to the global environment. The US economy has been pulling japan, in particular the exporters. But now the outlook for the US is good, but not as strong as before. WE have SOTTIE COI’1CâI’Iâ1S We have some concerns about the outlook in China and Asia, but over all the domestic market is very strong. We also see this with companies earning their money domestically. We have a stronghold here, and that’s helping tremendously. The garment industry in Bangladesh says it has lost at least $56 million since the start of the year, due to political unrest. More than 40 people have died in the violence. Bangladesh is one of the world’s biggest garment exporters, and business leaders are worried. 22-year-old Roxana is busy making clothes for Western retailers. The garment industry is Bangladesh’s biggest exporter, but it is going through a tough time. At the turn of the year, the opposition called on Prime Minister to step down. When she refused, they called for a nationwide blockade. Factories remain open in the capital, but it is difficult to move goods due to the violence. TRANSLATION: Transport is the main problem. The seaport is 300 kilometres away from here. It is very risky to transport goods during the blockade. Our shipment has dropped by 40%. Many factory owners don’t want to take risks. We want this blockade to end. So does the transport sector. It’s losing $6 million a day in the current unrest. All these trucks are stuck at the depot, because the country’s major highways have been blocked for weeks. Protesters have torched more than 500 vehicles, even trucks carrying essential items, like vegetables, rice and sugar. TRANSLATION: I don’t want to drive my truck on the highway, it’s too dangerous. I’m scared because a few drivers have been burnt to death. The crisis is also hitting people in their pockets, as food prices have gone up. This market is full of fruit and vegetables, but it has become more difficult to get supplies in. Political crises and blockades are nothing new in Bangladesh, but the rising death toll has caused fear. Business leaders are calling on the government and opposition to solve their differences peacefully at the negotiating table, rather than on the streets.

Ukraine’s pro-Russian rebels plan to recruit thousands more troops. As fighting intensifies, the US is considering whether to arm Kiev. The recent cuts in energy bills could have been much bigger. That is according to the consumer group Which. It claims households should have saved an average of £145 last year. The research, which is to be published later today, suggests that energy firms should now be cutting gas and electricity prices by as much as 10%. Our industry correspondent john Moylan has been looking at the figures. In the energy world, these are turbulent times. For the past year, wholesale prices have been falling, but are households across Britain really feeling the benefit? Pensioner Richard Langdon keeps an eye on his bills. As a British Gas customer, his tariff will fall by 5% at the end of February. He thinks that is too little, too late. It has to be nonsense, because wholesale prices have dropped quite a lot, and there is no reason for the industry they are in not to drop the price for the consumer. Which compared how the suppliers buy energy and compared that with much they charge all of us for it. It found that savings of £145 on a standard dual fuel bill could have been passed on to households last year. That amounts to total savings of £2.9 billion right across Britain. And it says that there is room for further cuts to gas and electricity prices of up to 10% in the year ahead. The mismatch between wholesale energy costs and the price we all pay on our bill has been big, and growing steadily. There is no excuse for any supplier not to pass through these savings to their customers, unless we have an energy market that is not working competitively. The suppliers don’t agree. They say that the energy we are using today may have been bought a few years ago. They do this to secure supplies, to keep the lights on, and to shield households from volatile prices. You can’t suddenly pass the savings on in one chunk. It is only as your buying strategy unwinds, and you as you can actually take advantage of these new, lower wholesale prices that you can pass those on to your customers. Do you believe that the price cuts we have seen recently really reflect what has been going on in the wholesale markets? Yes, I think that is a fair reflection. As prices are falling, as companies can actually afford to pass those savings on, they are doing so. The energy market is now in the midst of a major competition investigation, that should tell us once and for all whether the price we pay for energy is fair. john Moylan, BBC News.

Coming up on this programme: Europe’s transfer window closes and it’s English Premier League leaders Chelsea who’ve been the busiest on deadline day. Ghana coach Avram Grant urges action to be taken after what he calls a career-threatening tackle on Asamoah Gyan. Ferrari are firing - Sebastien Vettel is fastest again on the second day of F1 practice injerez. English Premier League leaders Chelsea were the busiest of Europe’s top clubs as the january transfer window closed on Monday. They concluded a $40 million deal as many of their rivals avoided the last-minute scramble for players that Transfer Deadline Day is famous for. With news on that transfer and details of all the other big moves injanuary, here’s our football reporter, john Bennett. Two players out and one player in for Chelsea. juan Cuadrado has moved to Stamford Bridge, one of the stars of the Colombian side during the World Cup. Rodriguez was their best but this one was not far behind. 26 years old and playing for Fiorentina, could he be the difference in the English Premier League? I can tell you that he’s delighted to move to Stamford Bridge. He has been on social media since signing. He also posted a picture of Stamford Bridge as well. He cannot wait until his debut. That is a player in for Chelsea. The other players going out are Mohamed Salah and Andre Schurrle, who fell out of favour with jose Mourhinho. Schurrle has moved to Wolfsburg in Germany, who are second in the Bundesliga. They are pleased to have a world champion in their team. This is their reaction on social media. I mentioned Mohamed Salah. He has gone to Fiorentina in a like-for-like swap. To be honest, it was a bit quiet on deadline day. Let’s have a look at some of the moves during the whole transfer window in january. Lukas Podolski was one of the first. Arsenal to Inter Milan. Inter have completely reshaped their squad. Victor Valdes, the former Barcelona goalkeeper, has joined Manchester United. He was out of contract, so it is a free transfer. Another signing for Inter Milan, Xherdan Shaqiri, the Bayern Munich international out of favour. The biggest move ofjanuary is Wilfried Bony moving from Swansea to Manchester City. Another player who could have an effect on the title race. And what about this man? 16-year-old Martin Odegaard has signed for Real Madrid. So many clubs are chasing him. Lucas Silva is another move to Real Madrid. The Champions League winners are hoping to regain the trophy in the second half of the city. One move from Manchester to Roma. We expected that and the move is now permanent after being on loan. And Gabriel Paulista has moved from Villarreal to Arsenal as they look to strengthen their defence. Not all moves, however, have done well. Samuel Eto’o was signed to Sampdoria a number of weeks ago but he is now reported to have skipped his training session on Monday. He could be leaving the club. There he is. It was a double training session and he did not want to train twice, so he went back to his home in Milan and there are already rumours he could be leaving his club. That is a story to follow over the next few days. john Bennett with all of the movers and shakers in this transfer window. Ghana’s head coach, Avram Grant, has criticised what he called the career-threatening tackle which looks likely to keep his captain, Asamoah Gyan, out of Thursday’s Africa Cup of Nations semifinal. The Black Stars forward injured his hip when he was fouled in stoppage time by Guinea goalkeeper, Naby Yattara, who was red-carded for the offence. His manager believes that the player must be banned for the challenge. What happened with this goalkeeper, what he did to Asamoah, I think this is an opportunity to be tough on everybody to show how they protect the players. When a goalkeeper, when it is 3-0... To do that deliberately... It was a few centimetres down and I can tell you if that were so, he will not play for a very long time. I think that CAF have to take a decision and display should be ~ -- this player should be banned for a long, long time. First, it is a bad injury. Second, if you do it at the last minute, it means you do not respect the game. And you don’t respect your friends that play against you. One player who will be making a landmark appearance on the field on Wednesday is the former England captain, Steven Gerrard. When he steps out against Bolton in their FA Cup fourth-round replay, he’ll be making his 700th Liverpool appearance. To put it in context, only two players have featured more times for the club. Having cemented his reputation as one of the club’s all-time greats, manager Brendan Rodgers paid tribute to his contribution, as the player prepares to leave his boyhood club to join the LA Galaxy at the end of the season. And what chances of Steven Gerrard being stood here next year? His new team-mates have been to the White House, honoured by President Barack Obama following their MLS triumph. It’s the third time in four years the Galaxy have been here, such is their league success. President Obama even remarked he was experiencing a touch of deja vu! I was just telling these guys backstage, you know, the degree to which they represent their sport so well. America is starting to realise what the beautiful game is all about and it is wonderful to see notjust what is happening at the highest level of professional sport but the legions of young people who are going to be continuing the tradition is here in the US of soccer foI’ TT’ISIâ1y yâ3I’S to COTTIE. Less than 24 hours after winning the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots have returned home to Boston. And you can see just how much snow has fallen. They were victorious against the Seattle Seahawks in Arizona. Their victory parade has been postponed until Wednesday because of that weather. Fans are calling it one of the best Super Bowl match as ever, with that dramatic sequence of play in the last few minutes. The star quarterback, Tom Brady, agrees. We have been on the other end of some great catches and not been able to finish it out, and this time, we made the play. There was no fight. Nobody lost confidence on defence. There was a lot of fight that the team had. 99 yards on the football field and we did. It is a great feeling. Not for a while has the red of Ferrari been leading the Formula 1 field, but four-time champion Sebastian Vettel continued his positive start with his new team by going fastest again on the second morning of pre-season testing in jerez. Behind him, the reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton looked comfortable on his first outing in the new Mercedes. The 30-year-old Brit is currently negotiating a new contract with Mercedes, with his current deal due to run out at the end of this year. They’re expected to be the team to beat again. Not everyone was running well in testing. Mclaren struggled with their new car, but Lewis admitted this was a god chance to iron out any problems ahead of the new season -- a good chance to iron out any problems ahead of the new season. ~ I have been here for many years and testing is not the exciting part for any racing driver. I want to race. This is what you do to build the foundation. You come here and it is work for all of us. We are working to understand the car, study any change or anything, whether it is drivability, the tyres, how they come in, how they degrade. You are trying to learn those things because they put you in good stead for the season. That is what it is about. You can’t get excited just yet because you don’t know where everyone stands. I am excited about the first race and that is how it is every year. There are so many positives in terms of the packaging of the engine and how tight the bodywork is and temperatures. That is working very well. When you see six laps on the board, people notice you have done six Luck is, which isn’t so good. -- done six laps. I am sure we will have more problems. You will have them with a new engine. It is so complicated now, the new system. I hope we can do some running to feel what we have and get a bit of information back to the factory to understand where we are and where we need to improve. There is plenty of time for the teams to get their cars right before the first race in Australia in March. And a reminder of our top story: Europe’s transfer window has closed with Chelsea conducting the biggest deal on deadline day. You can take a look at all the moves and find out who’s moved where by heading over to our website bbc.com/sport. But from me and the rest of the Sport Today team, goodbye. Definitely no hint of spring as yet. We are stuck in winter mode for the foreseeable future. Tuesday it stays cold with frost and snow through the next few days. Everything becoming slow-moving for a while, with little areas of low pressure drifting south across the UK and draping some snow showers across the north of Scotland and Northern Ireland. That is through the early part of Tuesday, with one to turning up across eastern England as well. More sleet and rain along the coast. Falling as sleet and rain across the coast but snow inland. Widespread frost to start with, however. These are the temperatures in the larger towns and cities, so the rural spots will start with -6 degrees or -8 degrees and a really hard frost. Snow could cause a few problems here and there, most significantly across northern Scotland over the high ground, but for the bulk of Scotland, it is just a very cold and frosty start with the occasional pocket of fog maybe to throw in to the mix. No major changes through the day. However, those showers will fade away across Northern Ireland. Heading further south, across Scotland, the Grampians, bringing a covering of snow to the higher ground. Further south, temperatures will lift slightly, showers turning more to rain or sleet. Something like two to six degrees. But as high as the temperatures do get, it will still feel colder than that in the wind. As we go through Tuesday night and into Wednesday, this area of high pressure begins to topple in, changing things a little bit. It won’t change the overnight temperatures very much, mind you, again a hard frost in most places outside of the larger towns and cities. A very cold start to the day on Wednesday. Snow showers drifting down the eastern side of England but still that mix of rain, sleet and snow in many places. That wind will have quite an edge to it as well, blowing in from the north. Lighter winds as you go further north and west. Not too bad in the sunshine. Five degrees on the east coast of Northern Ireland, for example. That eastern and north-easterly wind is beginning to set in for the latter part of the week. Very noticeable for most of us on Thursday. A largely dry story, however, with fairly cloudy skies. And that is how we set up for the latter part of the week, high-pressure pulling in across the UK. Pulling in some cold eastern winds. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. Our top stories: Australian journalist Peter Greste says he is relieved to be free, but feels incredible angst for his two colleagues still in prison in Egypt. Amidst all of this relief, I still feel a sense of concern, a real sense of worry, because if it is appropriate for me, if it is right for me to be free, then it is right for all of them to be free. Ukraine’s pro-Russian rebels plan to recruit thousands more troops. As fighting intensifies, the US considers arming Kiev. The second snowstorm in a week hits the US, causing at least seven deaths across the Midwest and north-east. And they have been overlooked for 500 years, but these two bronze statues may be priceless masterpieces by Michelangelo. Hello to you. The release of a second Aljazeera journalist from an Egyptian jail is imminent, according to Canada’s Foreign Minister. It is just a day since the Australian journalist Peter Greste was freed, more than 400 days into a seven-year sentence. He has spoken of his anguish at having to leave behind his two colleagues - the Egyptianjournalist Baher Mohamed, and Mohamed Fahmy, who has dual Egyptian-Canadian citizenship. All were accused of helping the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Orla Guerin reports. After a year behind bars with his Aljazeera colleagues, Peter Greste can now look forward to covering news, not making it, and to being reunited with his family. In his first interview, he explained how the nightmare ended. The prison warden called me over and told me that, you know, it’s time to pack your stuff. I said, what do you mean? He said, you’re going. Isaid, well, where? To another prison? No, the embassy is coming, they will be here in an hour. Get your stuff and go. And I can’t tell you that real mix of emotions that were boiling inside. His happiness tempered by anxiety about producers Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, who are still prisoners. Amidst all of this relief, I still feel a sense of concern, and a real sense of worry, because if it’s appropriate for me, if it’s right for me to be free, then it’s right for all of them to be free. But his colleagues are not the only ones waiting forjustice. While the Aljazeera case has generated huge interest abroad, there are otherjournalists injail in Egypt, getting little or no attention. The journalists’ union here says nearly 20 reporters and photographers remain behind bars. They are all Egyptians, and relatives fear that without foreign pressure, they could be forgotten. It seems Shokan Abu Zeid already has been. He has spent 530 days injail without charge. His brother Mohammed tells me he was arrested covering the violent dispersal of a Muslim Brotherhood sit-in. He says prison is taking his health and his spirit. We expected he might die doing hisjob, he says. We would have accepted that. But for him to die every day, that is hard for us. As Peter Greste savours freedom, the judge who jailed him has issued another verdict. He confirmed death sentences for 183 men convicted of killing policemen during Islamist riots. Critics say once again, Egyptianjustice is in the dock. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Cairo. Earlier, we spoke to Chris Flynn, Peter Greste’s lawyer in Perth Australia. I asked him if being free was a bit of mixed blessing. There could be no charges under Australian law, so far as we are aware, that could be laid against Peter at all. And our information is indeed that he will be free. That he is free now. And he will remain free when he arrives here in Australia. And you don’t expect him ever to face trial in Egypt? We don’t expect that that is the case. Obviously we are still waiting for formal paperwork from Egypt in order to be able to definitively determine what his legal status is in Egypt. Our understanding is, as I’ve said and we are confident, that there’s no additionaljudicial process to be undertaken in Australia. Second, we are seeking to determine that there should be no additional judicial process in Egypt as well. We don’t know yet. Peter obviously has been through quite an ordeal and he is at the moment undertaking, as you can understand, rest and relaxation in Cyprus and once he is ready to get on a plane and come back to Australia we know he will, to be with his family. We know his brother Mike is there with him in Cyprus now. We look forward to his return, as soon as he is able to do it, and obviously we look forward to when he is ready to pick up his pen again and getting back to doing what he loves. A senior White House official has signalled that President Obama may be considering sending weapons to help the Ukrainian military. The US has so far only supplied non-lethal aid to Ukraine’s government, which has been battling pro-Russian separatists since April. As the conflict drags on, the Moscow- backed rebels say they plan to recruit more fighters, to bring their numbers up to 100,000 They are trying to capture the town of Debaltseve from government forces, a crucial railhead linking the two main rebel-held cities, Donetsk and Lu ha nsk. David Stern reports from Kiev. Ukrainian artillery pounds separatist positions in the country’s east. This footage was recorded recently near the strategic railroad hub of Debaltseve. In the past week, fierce fighting has gripped the region. Kiev officials say their forces are holding out against a rebel offensive. Russian-backed militants, seen here, say they have surrounded the pro-Kiev troops in Debaltseve, and are tightening the noose. On Monday, the rebels said they would boost their forces to 100,000 fighters. Where they would recruit so many men was not clear. Kiev and western leaders fear the separatists will launch, with Russian assistance, a full-scale attack. The rebels say this move is defensive. TRANSLATION: We plan to form at least five additional brigades. Three motorised rifle brigades, an artillery brigade, and a tank brigade. This is the reserve which will guarantee us the ability to withstand any attack, and in case of success, to develop counter-attacks. In the West, calls are increasing to arm Kiev, to withstand the militants’ offensive. Up until now, Europe and the United States have provided non-lethal aid, like body armour. But resistance to provide the Ukrainians with weapons is still strong. TRANSLATION: Germany will not support Ukraine with weapons. It is my firm belief that this conflict cannot be solved militarily. Therefore we insist that, on one hand, we will impose sanctions if necessary. We have done that jointly with Europe. And on the other hand, we will use all diplomatic means to resolve this conflict through talks. As the fighting escalates, civilians are coming under heavy fire. Untold numbers have been killed or wounded. Others, like these people, have found refuge in hastily established camps. No-one knows when they will be able to go home, or if they will have a home to return to.

A tax crackdown on the overseas profits of US companies such as Apple and Microsoft is at the heart of the 2016 Budget formally unveiled by President Obama. It proposes a one-off 14% levy on foreign income stashed away by US corporations, raising $238 billion, and a 19% tax on their future foreign earnings. The Budget now faces months of wrangling with a Republican-controlled Congress.

Huge swathes of the US have been hit by heavy snow fall, after a powerful winter storm. Road conditions remain icy and treacherous. Flights, schools and businesses have been disrupted. And in Boston, the parade to celebrate the New England Patriots’ Super Bowl victory has been postponed. Ben Bland reports. It was not as though they needed any more snow in Massachusetts and even more has fallen in the second winter storm in less than a week. We thought we were getting off easy but then we had this blizzard and it sounds like there is more to come. So when it starts happening like this, you have to get ready for it and get plenty of gas for the snowplough get some shovels and hot chocolate, you’re all set. In Boston, another foot of snow has fallen. It’s caused disruption to thousands of flights. The New England Patriots were able to get home after their victory at the Super Bowl but the weather has put the celebrations on hold. Their victory parade has been postponed until Wednesday. The disruption caused by the storm has been felt across the north-east of the US. Chicago saw one of the heaviest snowfalls on record for February. Treacherous road conditions caused a serious pile-up, closing a main highway for several hours. February 2nd is Groundhog Day. Crowds turned out in Pennsylvania to see the famous Punxsutawney Phil supposedly whisper his weather prediction for the next six weeks. He apparently saw his shadow, which means no early spring.

In Detroit, like in other places, many schools and businesses were shut. Hardly any cars to be seen on the streets of America’s Motor City. Winter storm warnings are in place for part of Boston, Maine and New York state, as the north-east of America remains in an icy grip. The first large-scale trials of an experimental vaccine against Ebola have begun in Liberia, one of three West African countries worst affected by the current outbreak. So far the virus killed nearly 9,000 people. 27,000 volunteers will take part. Some will trial vaccines produced by the companies GSK and Merck, and some will be given a placebo, effectively a dummy shot. Each vaccine uses a different virus to carry non-infectious Ebola genetic material into the body. The idea is to spark an immune response. The challenge is to reassure people there is no danger that they could become infected by taking part. Our correspondent Mark Doyle reports now from Liberia. The first-ever large-scale Ebola vaccine trial. At one point last year, there were fears Ebola might spread from West Africa throughout the world. Today, a Liberian man led the way, in what may be part of a solution. I am the first to take it. I am the first person to take it today. You are number one? Iam number one. I wanted to be in the lead. So others can follow. just as important is sharing information with the local population. These community health workers will track the volunteers who have been vaccinated, monitoring their health, trying to build trust. The way this vaccine works is that they introduce into the body a tiny bit of the Ebola virus. But the key thing the doctors say here is that tiny bit of the virus, although it tricks the body into thinking it can fight against Ebola, cannot give Ebola. It’s impossible. Nurses dressed in full protective gear still treat Ebola patients in Liberia. The number of Ebola cases has now dropped considerably. And for these scientists, including the most senior Liberian involved, there is now some hope. A small, tiny country on the West Coast of Africa is making a difference in terms of making a significant contribution to global health. The fall in the number of Ebola cases is undoubtedly good news. And parts of the largest Ebola treatment centre in the world are being pulled down and burned. If the vaccine trial goes well too, it may well be possible to say that the end of West Africa’s Ebola nightmare is in sight. Mark Doyle, BBC News, Liberia. Stay with us on BBC News.

In the japan Times, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to give the country’s military a mandate to evacuate its nationals from crises overseas. A response of course to the murder of two japanese hostages. The New York Times reports last month’s terror attacks in Paris have prompted a debate on whether French national identity excludes Muslims. Analysts in the Moscow Times suggest President Putin has remained popular despite the country’s economic difficulties, because he is personally associated with national pride. Britain’s Prince Charles is said to have told ministers he no longer wants to be used to promote British arms sales in the Arab world, according to a new biography. That’s in the Times. And American regulators have given a Chinese insurance group the go-ahead to buy a New York hotel, the Waldorf Astoria. Anbang Insurance will pay $1.95 billion dollars for the Manhattan landmark. This is BBC News. The latest headlines: The Australian journalist, Peter Greste, who was freed by Egypt on Sunday, says he feels incredible angst for two of his colleagues still in prison. Ukraine’s pro-Russian rebels plan to recruit thousands more troops. As fighting intensifies, the US is considering whether to arm Kiev. The newly-appointed Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has told the BBC he’s optimistic that an understanding can be reached with Greece’s international creditors. Mr Varoufakis, who’s been meeting key financial figures in London, has discussed the possibility of restructuring his country’s debts. He spoke to our economics editor, Robert Peston. Was the meeting successful today? Yes, it was. Greece’s new Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis arriving at a swanky hotel in London’s Park Lane. So, for 90 minutes he spoke to a couple of 100 investors and hedge fund managers, bankers, those who have lent to Greece. He explained to them how he hopes to save his country from collapse. What reassurance were you able to give your creditors that their debt will be repaid? This is the strange kind of alliance that we are forging here tonight between the left-wing government and the financial sector. Odd bedfellows in the middle of a depression. These are the times we live in. It’s an alliance that makes perfect sense. Because when you are in a debt-deflationary cycle, putting an end to it both benefits the population, brings it out of the grasp of increasing misery and hopelessness, and increases equity. So, my meeting with the private investors here in London tonight gave I think both sides, them and me, a great deal of optimism about the future. The fact we are constantly in the headlines... Britain is not in the eurozone, of course. But Mr Varoufakis called in for a cup of tea with the Chancellor today, because he believes the British Government shares his view that the bailout deal imposed by Germany and the IMF is unsustainable. It’s clear that the standoff between Greece and the eurozone is fast becoming the biggest risk to the global economy. It’s a rising threat to our economy at home. In Europe, as in Britain, now is the time to choose competence over chaos. I urge the Greek Finance Minister to act responsibly. The greatest immediate problem is that billions are being withdrawn from its banks on the fear that the country will be forced out of the eurozone, which Mr Varoufakis says he wants to avoid. Do you think that your city audience understood your message that debt cannot be repaid without growth? I came to this meeting, as I actually come to meetings with my colleagues in various capitals, my counterparts, Finance Ministers with a left-wing heart and a narrative which could come out of a bankruptcy lawyer’s textbook. After the meeting I spoke to the city creditors and they largely agreed that Greece does need more financial help, especially from the eurozone’s biggest economy, Germany, but they are not betting Angela Merkel will stump up. Former rap mogul Suge Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder. Seems he struck two men with his pickup truck in Los Angeles - one of them died. Prosecutors claim Knight meant to run them over, after an argument. His lawyer says it was accidental, that he was trying to escape a vicious attack. Earlier, I spoke to Tanya Hart who is host of the syndicated radio show ""Hollywood Live with Tanya Hart"" in Los Angeles. I asked her what she knew. Well, actually, we have a long history with Suge Knight that goes all the way back to the 1980s, really, when he started out in this business as Bobby Brown’s bodyguard, believe it or not. Fast forward to where we are today and Suge Knight, unfortunately, has always been around crime related incidents. He has a long rap sheet himself. He is now eligible for what we call the three strikes law. That means, if he is convicted and sentenced, more than likely, he will go to jail for life because that is the way the law reads. I do know that he claims that he was being attacked by three or four men when this happened. He was shot six times back in the summer. He says he was weak from that and was being beaten by these men and took off as soon as he had the chance. I have not seen a single mark or scratch on him in the pictures as he turned himself in to the police as this incident happened. We are not sure where those alleged people are who were supposedly beating him up. We have no idea who they are or where they are. We do know that one person is dead and another person is injured. As you say, his legal position is tricky even without this. He served nearly five years injail for violating probation on assault charges. He has had the misfortune of being around a lot of trouble. A lot of trouble for a very, very long time. He was with Tupac when he was shot and killed. He has been there a couple of times when that happened. Recently, he was shot six times, and then while he was in hospital, he had to leave the hospital to go to court for another incident that took place last year. He was actually scheduled to go to court tomorrow for that incident and now, of course, he has a murder rap pending. Success in hip-hop and rap is pretty much dependent on having a bad rep, whether it is real or not, but in this case, there really has been quite a lot of heavy stuff. There really has. And part of what we are seeing here is that... he and Doctor dre started out together. Doctor Dre has become the first billionaire, with a B, coming out of the hip-hop world. He, of course, has changed his life like so many people have you came out of that hole Death Row Records. He and Snoop Dogg. They are living good life, quite frankly. And Suge Knight is seemingly stuck in a time warp and he really feels like he has to be a bad guy. He was always strong arming these people, and that is how he got them to do what he wanted them to do. But times have changed. Now for a story of treasures hidden in plain sight. Two bronze statues that have long been dismissed as minor works of art could in fact be by Michelangelo. The pair were identified from a tiny detail in a drawing which is 500 year old. -- in a drawing which is 500-years-old. If the claim proves true they would be the only surviving Michelango bronzes in the world. Our arts editor, Will Gompertz, has the details. Two idealised naked male figures sit astride a couple of snarling panthers. The modelling is superb, the compositions elegant. These are bronze sculptures of the highest quality, but who did them? Art historians have been arguing about that for over 100 years. No longer, maybe. Academics at Cambridge University think they have found the answer. We’ve got some fantastic new Michelangelos, which we firmly believe on an aggregate of evidence - visual, technical and anatomical - to be early works by Michelangelo from 1586 to 1608. That means the 30-year-old Michelangelo would have produced them after carving his sculpture of David, but before starting work on painting the Sistine Chapel. To say these two pieces are by Michelangelo is a very big and significant claim. It would make them the only two known bronze sculptures in the world by the great Renaissance master. So, what’s their evidence? This is exhibit A: A drawing they happened upon, showing a male figure on a panther. It’s not by Michelangelo, but it is a direct copy from him. Then there are the stylistic similarities between the way Michelangelo depicted certain physical details in his marble carvings, the anatomical accuracy of his drawings and the representation of both in the bronzes. Finally, there is the appliance of science, where they had specialist X-rays taken which have dated the works to a time that backs up their claim, but will it be supported by the wider academic community? What tends to happen is either that they’re fairly, almost surprisingly quickly accepted and become part of the great canon of art, or they’re equally swiftly forgotten, and three minutes later, nobody remembers them at all. If they are by Michelangelo, their value would rocket well above the £1.8 million a private collector reportedly paid for them in 2002, and a new chapter would open on the extraordinary legacy of a great Italian artist.

We are stuck in the winter mode for the foreseeable future. Tuesday, Stourton Lee stays cold. -- certainly. Frost and snow over the next few days. Everything becoming slow-moving for a while, with little areas of low pressure drifting south across the UK and draping some snow showers across the north of Scotland and Northern Ireland. snow inland, giving a further light covering in a few places. Widespread frost to start with, however. These are the temperatures in the larger towns and cities, so more rural spots will start with -6 or -8 degrees and a really hard frost. Snow could cause a few problems here and there, most significantly across northern Scotland over the high ground, but for the bulk of Scotland, it is just a very cold and frosty start with the odd pocket of fog maybe to throw in to the mix. No major changes through the day. Those showers will fade away across Northern Ireland. Heading further south across Scotland, into the Grampians, bringing a covering of snow across the higher ground. Further south, temperatures will lift slightly, showers turning more to rain or sleet. 2-6 degrees is as high as the temperatures will get and it will still feel colder than that in the wind. As we go through Tuesday night and into Wednesday, this area of high pressure begins to topple in, changing things a little bit. It won’t change the overnight temperatures very much, mind you, with a hard frost in most places outside of the larger towns and cities. A very cold start to the day on Wednesday. Further snow showers drifting down the eastern side of England but still that mix of rain, sleet and snow in many places. That wind will have quite an edge to it too, blowing in from the north. Lighter winds as you go further north and west. Four 5 to that the sunshine. Four or five degrees coast is feeling quite raw. That eastern and north-easterly wind is beginning to set in for the latter part of the week. And that’s how we set up for the latter part of the week, high-pressure pulling in across the UK and that’s bringing in some cold easterly winds.

Welcome to HARDtalk, with me, Zeinab Badawi. should scientists working with governments and officials give opinions, orjust stick to giving scientific facts? My guest today is the Scottish microbiologist Professor Anne Glover. She has just left her post as the first chief scientific adviser to the EU Commission President, and this is her first extensive broadcast interview since then. There had been persistent reports of difficulties during her three years in Brussels, particularly in regards to her unequivocal support for genetically modified crops. While still in the post, she has said that in-house politics had hampered the efficiency of her role. Was she at loggerheads with the EU commission? Professor Anne Glover, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you. You were the first ever chief scientific adviser to the chief EU president, but it seems like you may be the last. Why? I am not the right person to ask that, to be honest. I think what we could start off by saying is that there is no doubt that the European Commission needs and indeed wants scientific advice or evidence on which to base its policy. I was an experiment, if you like. By the outgoing president, jose Manuel Barroso. And the new president, jean-Claudejuncker, has to decide how he will get that independent scientific advice to underpin policy. So we will have to wait and see. The commission press office told us that your position was not axed or scrapped, it wasjust coming to the natural end of its term, three years. But there had been reports particularly in the British press that you were sacked. Yes, I think maybe that says more about the British press, to be honest, rather than the situation in the commission. My role was tied to that of the president of the European Commission. So the outgoing president decided he wanted a chief scientific adviser. I was appointed for his presidency only. And so it was natural that I would leave at the end of that. That was always my understanding and that of the commission. The reason why ask you whether you were sacked is there had been reports about difficulties that you had. And you yourself said at a conference in the summer I would say, in-house politics did hamper the efficiency of the role. Many people in the commission simply did not want a chief scientific adviser. So it was a little bit difficult. Would you elaborate on that? If you think about the commission, it is a very large organisation. So over 30,000 staff. It has been going for quite sometime, so there are established positions and authorities within the commission. So if you essentially parachute in a role and quite a prominent role, a chief scientific adviser, who reports directly to the president of the commission, it is going to be quite difficult for some people on the commission, thinking... Which some people? Staff in the commission. Like to? Bureaucrat? Well, you could call them bureaucrats. Iwould not Bureaucrat? Well, you could call them bureaucrats. I would not call mY them bureaucrats. I would not call my colleagues bureaucrats, but colleagues who worked in the commission, many of them felt that there was already sufficient scientific advice, which was available at the commission. And indeed there is a lot. Many commissioners would have felt that they had a role that was important. And that they should give scientific advice. What I think it was... How will I put it? A misunderstanding of the role. Because a chief scientific adviser role, something that in the UK we are very familiar with because we have had this for over 50 years, but in other, certainly member states of the European Union and elsewhere in globally, people are not quite so familiar of this idea of an independent person. So someone, and it is going back to what you said about my temporary position. Someone who is not going to be there for years and years. It is not my career to be there. So do you feel that there was some resentment towards you? I think there was genuine difficulty. I think many people welcomed me. And others felt why do we need somebody who offers us independent scientific advice? Why will that add to what we do already? Will it not be uncomfortable? Will, you know, will the press, and indeed the press have paid attention to the role in a way thatis paid attention to the role in a way that is different to what was already happening. And how did that difficulty manifest itself? Did you find yourself frozen out of meetings? Oryour find yourself frozen out of meetings? Or your requests for meetings went unheeded, or what? I think we can focus on the negative, but I think it is good to also acknowledge what was achieved. So a huge amount was achieved in just three years. And that is because people were willing to work with me. I think I could have achieved very much more, if people had been more open to the possibilities that my role would give to the commission in strengthening and making in a way more transparent how scientific advice or evidence is used to underpin policy. But in that six-month period betweenjose Manuel Barroso leaving and we all knew that jean-Claude juncker was going to be his successor, did you meet jean-Claude juncker or any member of his team? No, not at all. Did you asked to? Yes, I did. And did you get a No, I didn’t. So, I mean, that is because presumably the new presidency felt that it wanted to make its own decisions. About how it would deliver independent scientific advice. And the new commission has said that it values independent scientific advice on more than one occasion. And that it is to consider how it will be delivering that. But they did not want to hear from me about what had worked and what had not worked in my role. But of course the commission press office to say that they have science advisory committees, and also in-house joint research Council, which also includes scientists. So they would say that yes, we are getting scientific advice -- counsel. Yes, and I acknowledge that. You mentioned there the joint research centre. And the GRC, thejoint research centre, has got almost 3000 working scientists on its staff -- jRC. So yes, it can provide scientific advice. At the difficulty for a president is how is that advice translated? How is it delivered? And also, I mentioned earlier, this independence. jRC staff are employees of the commission, and of course I was an employee of the commission while I was there. But the most important thing for me was the evidence. Rather than the objectives of the commission. So therefore, giving you were so passionate, as you say, about the role and what you are doing, would you have liked to stay on? No, definitely not. Ithink doing, would you have liked to stay on? No, definitely not. I think if you ask any chief scientific adviser, and previously I was chief scientific adviser in Scotland, and that was also a temporary role. And so I left and someone else would come along and take over that role. It is very important that you don’t have someone, you know, incumbent in the role, because then you lose your independence. And if you like, you become, you know, part of the establishment of the organisation. It is important to have that challenge, or I believe it is important to have that challenge. So you did the job for three years, and let’sjust quickly pick you did the job for three years, and let’s just quickly pick up one point on when you were giving advice to the former commission president, jose Manuel Barroso. There was a letter injuly 2014, jose Manuel Barroso. There was a letter in july 2014, a letter injuly 2014, a group of nine NGOs including Greenpeace, and they said the role of the Chief scientific adviser has been unaccountable, not transparent, and controversial. We have not been able to obtain any information on what the commission president has requested advice on, let alone what advice he has been given. Did that lack of transparency it worry you? Should you not have been involved in a process that was not only independent but also transparent? I think what worried me was the wording of that letter, which you have just read out. wording of that letter, which you havejust read out. Because have just read out. Because of course I was accountable, and of course I talked a lot about the evidence that I felt was important to underpin a whole number of policies. The actual advice I provided to Presidentjose Manuel Barroso, none of that advice, whether it is scientific advice or economic advice or political advice, it is not out there in the public domain. Although I have asked thatit public domain. Although I have asked that it should be. Because for me, I don’t feel that this is in any way controversial to talk about the evidence. But I was disappointed because I feel that those original NGOs that signed the letter, they knew very well what my job was, NGOs that signed the letter, they knew very well what myjob was, and they knew how important transparency was to me. And Ifelt that they knew how important transparency was to me. And I felt that it was very disingenuous of them to make that commentary. Do you think you were in any way, your departure, or perhaps some of the reports around your tenure perhaps some of the reports around yourtenure in the perhaps some of the reports around your tenure in the post, that perhaps the green lobby may have somehow contributed to you not being invited to stay on? Well, let’s just not this thing on the head. I mean, I myself informed resident jean-Claudejuncker before he took over the presidency of the European Commission that it was not my intention to seek continuation in the role. I did not want to stay. I felt I had done what I could reasonably do in the three years. As far as... reasonably do in the three years. As faras... Is far as... Is that the case, can I just ask you, the British Conservative MP Gerling said I fear jean-Claude juncker has caved in to the green lobby. Well, that is her view. I have no idea. As we established early on, I don’t know what Presidentjean-Claudejuncker what Presidentjean-Claude juncker and his what Presidentjean-Claudejuncker and his team were thinking. But let’s put in context that letter from the non-governmental organisations you mentioned. Does, or that letter pales into insignificance in terms of the warm and very positive letters of support from scientists, from loan at academies, notjust in Europe but across the world -- learned. Think tanks, business organisations, all of them have written saying they want to see this role continued and strengthened. They don’t trust the NGOs then, to make the comments? Or you don’t think their opinion has any validity? I think their opinion is surely valuable, because if you ask, and I am thinking now of European citizens, if you ask them who they trust, I think that they would put NGOs reasonably high up the list. And that would have been mY the list. And that would have been my feeling as well. But I am genuinely disappointed that even although they knew what the situation was, and they knew what my role was, they chose to manufacture a description of it which didn’t sound very good. Well, let me perhaps give you an idea of why they sent the letter they did. Because you have called opposition to do GM crops, or GM knows, as they are sometimes called, a form of madness. So you are a staunch supporter of GM crops, saying the opposition is a form of madness -- GMOs. So that is going to upset many members of the public. No, becausel going to upset many members of the public. No, because I am not a strong advocate of GM crops. What I am saying is that the technology used to generate GM crops is safe. That is what the scientific consensus is. Now it is up to individual countries, nations, to decide whether or not they want to use that technology. But to keep on saying that we don’t have enough evidence, orthat saying that we don’t have enough evidence, or that there might be some kind of unforeseen negative consequence of using this technology, that is simply not the case. And I think you have to speak out because what people who don’t want GM technology in terms of using it to deliver new crop species, that is an ideology. They are not looking at the evidence. What you were told of this letter again, the NGO letter sent to the media, the current chief scientific adviser presented one-sided, partial opinions on the debate of the use of GMOs in agriculture. That actually you are not giving a clear picture. I did give a clear picture, because I talked about the evidence. One-sided. But if all the evidence tells us that human activity is having an negative impact on the Kuok, climates, it is not only to say that, actually, maybe it doesn’t. In the same way, with GM, to say, I can’t balance it when that would be artificial balance. So you are saying there is scientific consensus on the use of GM crops. Yes. On the technology. On the technology. However, as you know, in 2013 in October there was a letter signed by nearly 300 professionals, including many scientists, for example Doctor Belinda Martineau from the University of California who helped commercialise the world’s first GM wholefood and she said I wholeheartedly support this Tarro, thoughtful, and professional statement describing the lack of scientific consensus on the safety of genetically engineered crops. So there is clearly not a consensus. In the scientific community. Consensus COFISEFISUS ITIEBFIS perceived view is that the technology is safe. I could say there is also a letter signed by over 30,000 saying that humans are not having a negative impact on the planet. But there is scientific consensus that we are having a negative impact. Let’s stick with GM crops because you say in a matter of fact way, and I am trying to give you an idea of why Greenpeace and other NGOs say you present a partial, one-sided opinion on this and say that there is scientific consensus when there are many scientistss, as we know from the statement they came out in October 2013, that there isn’t one opinion. There are not many scientist, the danger of looking at balance when it is artificial. The genuine consensus of the scientific community is that the technology is safe. Let’s go to another issue that is also controversial and dividing people, governments somewhat supporting it and some not, fracking, is that something you support? I don’t support it or not supported. Fracking is a way of recovering unconventional gas. A fossil fuel. And the bigger issue for me is looking at our use of fossil fuels and the impact on our climate. In terms of energy generation, fracking as a means of extraction of gas has risks associated with it. The three risks in no particular order would be seismicity, contamination of groundwater from the fracking fluids and fugitive methane release, which would contribute to negatively... Negatively to climate change. Every form of energy production we have, coal mining, oil extraction, all of them have risk associated with them and that’s exactly the case with fracking. The bigger issue... You except there are risks with fracking? Yeah, there are risks with fracking as with every other form of generating energy. When the UK chief scientist says on fracking, this could carry unforeseen risks in the way that tobacco and asbestos did, you except there isn’t always certainty with science? No, that’s the beauty of science. It is why science and politics sometimes are uncomfortable bedfellows, and that’s because in science we love uncertainty and in politics people prefer certainty. And so it is difficult to marry those two worlds, so there are always uncertainties andindeed so there are always uncertainties and indeed risks. What we need to do is quantify and manage those risks, we need to assess them, how big they are, and then, what do we do? Is it worthwhile? Because everything we do, as an individual or whether we do it in communities, everything we do is risky but we manage those risks and that’s what we have to do. You manage those risks but accept that sometimes governments don’t have the wherewithal, infrastructure, it resources to manage them so that even if there is a small risk involved people might think that yes the risk is small but we all worry about a government’s ability to route manage that risk. The government’sjob is ability to route manage that risk. The government’s job is to weigh up the evidence and make decisions. They are managing risks. White sometimes there are novel risks that you might not foresee as we said, with GMOs, we don’t know what novel risks there might be and that was the point the NGOs made and therefore people question whether governments have the ability to manage those novel risks. -- sometimes there are. What you would have to do is have some kind of legitimate, articulation of what the risks might be. You cannot say that, if someone came here and offered you a new material to make clothing out of and said, this is a wonderful thing, this material, it you won’t have to wash it, you won’t have to iron it or whatever, it will last for ever and it will change every day into something wonderfully new for you. day into something wonderfully new foryou. On for you. On the face of it you think it is good but there might be a risk associated with it, so no, that would be unreasonable, we wouldn’t adopt anything you. Whereas I think we should be open to what is possible and we should assess and manage risk -- new. Looking at the EU, it spends billions on scientific research and EU governments do the same. Do you feel that people are getting value for money? I think they could get better value for money. I talked earlier about the importance of generating evidence to base policy on, that generation of evidence, knowledge generated when we do science, that is very expensive to produce, so it is quite a precious thing. And especially in Europe, we are not awfully good at looking at that evidence and looking at the possibilities and having an appetite for saying, could we do something differently? Could our citizens more generally get the benefit of this new information we are generating? And I think if we come back to the beginning of the conversation, that is why it is useful to have chief scientific adviser is or whatever we call them, people who are if you like shining a light on what might be happening in the future -- advisers. What new technology will likely appear on the scene so that we can take advantage of it and manage any risks or unintended consequences. There is a Republican member of the US house of representatives who say people are troubled by the idea politics is driven by ideology and debate is posturing, science moves away from political spin because it is tied to evidence and he says that scientific thinking based on logic and evidence could improve lawmakers’ decisions on issues like voting systems, air transportation security, does he have a point? Like politicians in the EU and EU governments to think more like you, the scientists? Yes, for any of us... Put us in the same basket and say that we are all just citizens. If a lawmaker comes along and says, we are going to develop this new policy, this new law, and we are doing itjust because we feel like it or because it suits our philosophy, he will be less convinced by that than somebody saying, this is the evidence underpinning it and this is why we think this is a good idea. Finally, do you think, looking back on your three years as chief EU scientific adviser that you could have achieved more in your role? Honestly, probably not. I did achieve a huge amount, even with a very small at wonderful team. We did a lot and the fact that we are talking today and that people are talking about chief scientific adviser is more generally or scientific advice, that is testament to the fact that there is an appetite for this sol testament to the fact that there is an appetite for this so I think that could we have done any more? I don’t think so -- but. -- advisers. Not in the time we had available and with the resources we had available. But we did achieve a great deal. Like in the headline, what? One thing for example, when I started, there were three chief scientific advisers or equivalent across the European Union and by the time I left I had persuaded, just by gentle persuasion, that it was valuable to have independent scientific advice and 15 member states now have a chief scientific adviser or equivalent. You couldn’t persuade the new president, jean-Claude juncker, to maintain the post of chief scientific adviser. No. And I didn’t have the opportunity to do that. But he has not made his decision about how he wants that independent scientific advice delivered. It is possible that he still might think that that is a useful model. Would you see him if he asked you to? Of course I would, because... he asked you to? Of course I would, because. .. just because... just to recapitulate in a way, I have had three fantastic years at the European Commission working with great people, thoroughly enjoyed it. I am an absolute committed European, so any help that I could provide, I want to do that. Professor Angela -- Anne Glover, thank you so much for coming onto HARDtalk. Thank you. Definitely no hints of spring as yet. We are stuck in the winter mode for the foreseeable future. Tuesday, certainly stays cold. Frost and snow over the next few days. Everything becoming slow-moving for a while, with little areas of low pressure drifting south across the UK and draping some snow showers across the north of Scotland and Northern Ireland.

I’m Naga Munchetty. Our main story this hour: Was genocide committed during the war between Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s? The International Court ofjustice will later rule on why 20,000 people died during the four year war in the Balkans. Welcome to the programme. Other stories that we are keeping across for you: The new Greek finance minister tells the BBC he’s optimistic about reaching a deal with international creditors. The second snowstorm in a week hits the United States. At least seven people have died in the Midwest and north-east. I’m Sally Bu ndock. In business: Oil prices rise on the speculation global industry is ~ "" BFE WE -- are we beginning to face a new low price Emerging from a crisis in style: As the eurozone’s largest bank opens its books, we ask whether a new boss means a new era for Santander. We look at the fortune’s of Europe’s biggest bank. Santander reports results. judges at the United Nations’ highest court are preparing to hand down a ruling in the case of Croatia versus Serbia. Both are accused of violating the UN’s genocide convention, by deliberately trying to kill the other’s people during the conflict in the Balkans. This isjust the second genocide case to come before the International Court ofjustice. Anna Holligan reports. In 1991 book of was in flames. The Serbs were trying to stop the Croats from forming a breakaway state. The Croatian city was devastated. Hundreds of people were murdered by the Yugoslav army and served paramilitaries. Fouryears the Yugoslav army and served paramilitaries. Four years after the occupation, the Croats launched operation Storm, a battle to reclaim more than 10,000 square kilometres of territory that had been taken by the Serbs and turned into the self-proclaimed Serb republic. It was the largest land battle in Europe since the Second World War. Approximately 2000 Serbs were slaughtered. Croatia’s four-year war of independence claimed an estimated 20,000 lives. Croatia took Serbia to the Hague, accusing its leaders of being in denial overa the Hague, accusing its leaders of being in denial over a policy of genocide. Serbia files a counterclaim over the expulsion of 230,000 Serbs from Croatia in 1995. Genocide is considered to be the most serious crime in international law. It’s defined as an act committed with the intent to destroy it all or part of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. This is one of the most contentious cases to be heard at the ICj. In this particular instance two countries claimed that the other has committed genocide on their territory. That feeds into current political divisions, internally and externally, in these countries that struggle with their past and still point a finger of blame to the other country concerned. Two decades on and relations between the countries have been transformed the odd recognition but there are still some awkward moments. In 2012 to Croatian generals, charged with ethnic cleansing of Serbs from Croatia, were acquitted by the UN’s Yugoslavian warcrimes tribunal. One man’s Keira is another’s villain. Croats were -- some deny the scale of the authorities. This legal judgement for many will shed a light on what actually happens during the Balkans’ darkest years. The ICj’s judges will decide whether either country or both are guilty of genocide. Incitement to commit genocide or composite here in genocide in Croatia. -- complicity in. The newly-appointed Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has told the BBC that he is optimistic that an understanding can be reached with Greece’s international creditors. Mr Varoufakis, who’s been meeting key financial figures in London, discussed the possibility of restructuring his country’s debts. He spoke to our Economics Editor Robert Peston. Was the meeting successful today? Yes, it was. Greece’s new Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis arriving at a swanky hotel in London’s Park Lane. So for 90 minutes he spoke to a couple of 100 investors and hedge fund lenders, bankers, those who have lent to Greece. He explained to them how he hopes to save his country from collapse. What reassurance were you able to give your creditors that their debt will be repaid? This is the strange kind of alliance that we are forging here tonight between the left-wing government and the financial sector. Odd bedfellows in the middle of a depression. These are the times we live in. It’s an alliance that makes perfect sense. Because when you are in a debt-deflationary cycle, putting an end to it both benefits the population, brings it out of the grasp of increasing misery and hopelessness and increases equity. So, my meeting with the private investors here in London tonight gave I think both sides, them and me, a great deal of optimism about the future. The fact we are constantly in the headlines... Britain is not in the eurozone, of course. But Mr Varoufakis called in for a cup of tea with the Chancellor today, because he believes the British Government shares his view that the bailout deal imposed by Germany and the IMF is unsustainable. It’s clear that the standoff between Greece and the eurozone is fast becoming the biggest risk to the global economy. It’s a rising threat to our economy at home. In Europe, as in Britain, now is the time to choose competence over chaos. I urge the Greek Finance Minister to act responsibly. The greatest immediate problem is that billions are being withdrawn from its banks on the fear that the country will be forced out of the eurozone, which Mr Varoufakis says he wants to avoid. Do you think that your city audience understood your message that debt cannot be repaid without growth? I came to this meeting, as I actually come to meetings with my colleagues in various capitals, my counterparts, Finance Ministers with a left-wing heart and a narrative which could come out of a bankruptcy lawyer’s textbook. After the meeting I spoke to the city creditors and they largely agreed that Greece does need more financial help, especially from the eurozone’s biggest economy, Germany, but they are not betting Angela Merkel will stump up. And Sally’s here with all the business news. Four weeks we have been talking about plummeting oil prices, months even. -- forweeks. even. -- for weeks. Are even. -- forweeks. Are you changing your story? Have we hit the bottom? Market speculate that we have because the price has been headed higher over the past few days, after months of a fall in the price of black gold. It would seem maybe we are at the bottom. Let’s have a look at what’s been going on. In the last two sessions the price of crude oil has climbed 11.8%. After a seven month rout some analysts say that the bottom of the market has now been hit. In a few hours time BP is expected to report a fall in profits of 15%. It is also expected to cancel some major new projects as it adjusts its capital expenditure to reflect a new lower oil price. We will have a lot more detail on by the price of oil has been headed upwards and what companies are doing to change into this new era. Also today: The eurozone’s biggest banks will be opening their books. But will the numbers make the Santander’s new boss smile, or not? Ana Botin has been chief executive for less than five months and in that time she has already set ambitious new lending targets for the bank. She also aims to accelerate growth in key markets Britain, Spain and the United States. So can Santander break the cycle of malaise in the eurozone’s banking sector? We’ll bring you more in World Business Report. Also, in Australia, a surprise cut in interest rates sent the Aussie dollar to a six-year low. We will get the latest from our team in Singapore. More to come soon. The leader of the Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine has announced plans to mobilise men of fighting age to take on government forces. Speaking as fighting in eastern Ukraine intensified, Alexander Zakharchenko said he wanted to bring the rebel forces up to 100,000 strong. A forensic team from the Netherlands has recovered more human remains from the crash site of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in Eastern Ukraine. They also recovered some personal belongings and wreckage that had been found by local residents. The plane, on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down injuly, killing all 298 passengers and crew aboard. The anti-Islamisation movement Pegida, which originated in Germany, has held its first march in Austria. Several hundred people took part in the rally, in the capital Vienna. Around 5,000 joined a counter demonstration. Riot police were deployed to keep the two sides apart. Huge swathes of the US have been hit by heavy snow fall after a powerful winter storm. Road conditions remain icy and treacherous. Flights, schools and businesses have been disrupted. In Boston, the parade to celebrate the New England Patriots’ superbowl victory has been postponed. Ben Bland reports. It wasn’t as though they needed any more snow in Massachusetts, but even more has fallen in the second winter storm in less than a week. Yeah, we thought we were getting off easy but then we had this blizzard and then this and it sounds like there is more to come. So when it starts happening like this, you have to get ready for it and get plenty of gas for the snowplough, get some shovels and hot chocolate, you’re all set. In Boston, another foot of snow has fallen. It has caused disruption to thousands of flights. The New England Patriots were able to get home after their victory at the Super Bowl but the weather has put the celebrations on hold. Their victory parade has been postponed until Wednesday. The disruption caused by the storm has been felt across the north-east United States. Chicago saw one of the heaviest snowfalls on record for February. Treacherous road conditions caused a serious pile-up, closing a main highway for several hours. February 2nd is Groundhog Day. Crowds turned out in Pennsylvania to see the famous Punxsutawney Phil supposedly whisper his weather prediction for the next six weeks. He apparently saw his shadow, which means no early spring. Meanwhile, the Mayor of Sun Prairie in Wisconsin got, well, more than a prediction. In Detroit, like in other places, many schools and businesses were shut. Hardly any cars to be seen on the streets of America’s Motor City. Winter storm warnings are in place for part of Boston, Maine and New York state, as the north-east of America remains in this icy grip. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: A gangster rap - after a fatal hit-and-run accident, former rap mogul ‘Suge’ Knight is charged with murder. Now a look at some UK news. A free vote is due to be held in Parliament on whether to allow babies to be born from embryos containing the DNA of three people. Scientists say using the DNA of the father, mother and another woman would help to avoid life-threatening genetic diseases being passed on. The technique is backed by the government, but Church leaders oppose it. Police forces in England and Wales have been criticised for setting up a database with 18 million photographs that include the faces of hundreds-of-thousands of people who have never committed or been charged with a crime. The Government’s Biometrics Commissioner says he’s concerned because the facial recognition database isn’t regulated. A Public Accounts Committee report by MPs has called for the NHS in England to undergo radical change so it becomes financially sustainable. The Committee’s chairwoman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, says immediate savings can be made. The Department of Health says all NHS organisations know that financial discipline is as important as safe care. This is BBC News. The headlines: The International Criminal Court of justice will rule later on a long-standing genocide case between Croatia and Serbia. The Greek Finance Minister tells the BBC that he is optimistic and understanding can be reached with Greece’s international creditors. The Australian journalist Peter Greste says that he is relieved to be free at is extremely concerned about having left behind two colleagues injail in Egypt. Peter Greste who works for Aljazeera was freed and deported on Sunday after being held for 400 days. His colleagues remain behind bars. Relatives of Mohamed Fahmy say he has renounced his Egyptian citizenship to secure his release. He also has a Canadian passport. There is no word about his colleague, who is an Egyptian national. Speaking to Aljazeera, Peter Greste described the moment that he learned he would be released. No, I was not expecting it at all. I woke up thinking very much about the campaign ahead of us. Really feeling as though we were going to have spend an extended stretch in prison and I went for a run and the prison warden called me over and told me it is time to pack your stuff. I said, ""What do you mean?"" He said, ""You’re going."" Isaid, ""Well, where? To another prison?"" He said, ""No, no, no - the Embassy’s coming, they’ll be here in an hour, get your stuff and go."" And I can’t tell you that real mix of emotions that was boiling inside. It was such a sense of relief and excitement, also real stress at having to say goodbye to my colleagues and friends and people who have really become family inside that prison. You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very well. It was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they would have to put up with this. And then the ride to the airport, there was a sense of really wondering if it was going to come to an end, because there were a lot of false starts with this. An awful lot of false alarms, moments when we thought it was close, only to have it snatched away. I didn’t let myself believe it really was happening until I got my backside on the seat in the plane and we knew then that this is it. Former rap mogul Shug Knight has been charged with murder and attempted murder. He is accused of hitting two men with his pick-up truck in Los Angeles. One of them died. Prosecutors claim that Knight meant to run them over after having an argument with them. His lawyer says it was accidental and that he was trying to escape a vicious attack. Peter Bowes is in Los Angeles. There are two distinctive sides to this story. According to prosecutors, Suge Knight is now accused of murder and attempted murder and two charges of hit-and-run. This stems from an incident towards the end of last week in the car park at a fast food restaurant when it seemed that he was in some sort of argument with two other men. According to Suge Knight’s lawyer, he was trying to escape because he was attacked. The fact that one man died and the other was hurt, he says, is an accident. The other side of the story is that this was a deliberate attempt to cause harm and death. He is denying, according to his lawyer, the charges. We understand he will appear in court on Tuesday, just a few hours away, and, as you say he is still in bail. -- still injail. Is bail has been revoked because they are concerned about witnesses possibly being intimidated and that he could be potentially a flight risk, that he could try to get out of California and away from the scene of the crime. SpoIâlS VIEWS, FIOW. English Premier League leader Chelsea was the busiest of Europe’s top clubs when the january transfer window closed on Monday. The team signed the Colombian forward juan Cuadrado in a $40 million deal, as he moved from Italian side Fiorentina. He was one of his country’s star performers at the World Cup in Brazil. Leaving Chelsea is German World Cup winner Andre Schurle, -- Schurrle, whojoins Bundesliga side Wolfsburg in a $33 million deal. The Australian forward Tim Cahill left his contract a year early with Major League Soccer’s New York Red Bulls to join the Chinese team, Shanghai Shenhua. Ghana’s head coach Avram Grant has criticised what he called a career threatening tackle which seems likely to keep his captain Asamoah Gyan out of Thursday’s Africa Cup of Nations semifinal. The Black Stars forward injured his hip when he was fouled in stoppage time by the Guinea goalkeeper, Naby Yattara, who was red-carded for the offence. His manager believes that the player must be banned for the challenge. What happened with this goalkeeper, what he did to Asamoah, I think this is an opportunity to be tough on everybody to show how they protect the players. To do that deliberately... If it was a few centimetres down, I can tell you he would not be playing for a very long time. I think that they have to take a decision and this player should be banned for a long, long time. First, it is a bad injury. Second, if you do it at the last minute, it means you do not respect the game. One player who will be making a landmark appearance on the field on Wednesday is the former England captain, Steven Gerrard. When he steps out against Bolton in their FA Cup fourth-round replay, he’ll be making his 700th Liverpool appearance. To put this in context, only two players have featured more times for the club. Having cemented his reputation as one of Liverpool’s all-time greats, manager Brendan Rodgers paid tribute to his contribution as Gerrard prepares to leave his boyhood club to join the LA Galaxy at the end of the season. It is an incredible achievement, as I have said before, and I’m sure it won’t happen again at this club. A remarkable player and to know him as well as that is the other advantage we have in seeing his professionalism as a player. It’s notjust him in the game, it’s in his life. He has wonderful talent and wonderful ability but he lives his life for the game and, as I said before, he is unique. He has been coming here all of his life among the people that he loves and the club that he loves and it is a remarkable achievement. Scientists have discovered that birds flying in a V-formation take it in turns to lead the flock. A team led by researchers from Oxford University here in the UK used tracking devices to monitor the position of each bird in a migrating group. They found that the animals worked in pairs, swapping between leader and follower, to save energy during their long journey. Here’s our science reporter Victoria Gill. For a large, heavy bird, flying is tough. It consumes so much energy that many don’t survive their first migration. Butjust like familiar V shaped flocks of geese, these rare northern bald ibises fly in formation to get extra lift from the air of the wings of the birds in front. The aim of this study was to decide how the birds solve the dilemma of which bird takes the very tiring the. Scientists fitted each ibis with a GPS data logger to monitor their movements while they flew. This showed that the animals worked in pairs, taking it intends lead and follow. By essentially pairing up with just lead and follow. By essentially pairing up withjust member of lead and follow. By essentially pairing up with just member of the flock, the birds were able to have their formation constantly shift around like a cycling planet to allow every ibis a much-needed rest. -- a cycling peloton. The researchers believe this method, working in twos and taking it in turns, could be behind much more crucial cooperation in the animal kingdom. The mountains in Arizona in the south-west of the US are home to many observatories because the area is unusually free from light pollution. Scientists from all over the world come to study the cosmos. However, what is less well known is that the Vatican has an observatory there too. BBC Pop Up’s Matt Danzico met some jesuit astrophysicist priests to find out more. The story is that somebody has told us that the Vatican has priests station here in these mountains, doing research on space and even other in habitable worlds. I may jesuit priest but here in Tucson we have a research base at the Vatican Observatory. No, we are not doing anything strange. We are really doing science. We are not trying to find aliens that we could evangelise. In an intellectual sense, of course science and doctrines of the world’s organised religions are completely incompatible. They have been for hundreds of years. I find incompatible. They have been for hundreds of years. Ifind it possible to both believe in stars and a creator. The Vatican Observatory is a very small operation. Infact, there are only about ten active scientist. Because of the curious way in which we are recruited, we need to be Priest. Some type of people Observatory has existed since 1582. The Vatican Observatory has been in Tucson since the beginning of 1981, Observatory has been in Tucson since the beginning of1981, so the beginning of 1981, so it has had a formal arrangement with the University of Arizona to have a research group. They came here when their site in Italy became too light polluted to really do decent research. It did not shop me when I found out that the Catholic Church was worried about states and calendars. What did surprise me was when I came here to Arizona to find that they were also interested in magnetic white dwarf and a story. -- and astroid. Is there some sort of conflict between belief in what the Bible has offered up in the creation of the Earth and research into what you’re looking at, that is in habitable worlds in other star systems? I don’t think so. I don’t think the Bible has much to say on the topic because the Earth is habitable and the Earth is a heavenly body. Other heavenly bodies are probably habitable as well and if they are habitable, they are probably inhabited. The Vatican Observatory has never been a leading research establishment. That doesn’t mean they’re doing nonsense research. As long as their mythology doesn’t get in the way of their science, it does not particularly bother me. I think people who are drawn to questions of faith are also drawn to astronomy because you are asking very big question. In science, what a think is happening is that we are somehow in this very strange dialogue, leading us, inviting us, beckoning us, deeper into the mystery. And you can find much more from our pop-up bureau on our website. We keep the cold weather going with widespread overnight frost. Chilly in the day and snow thrown into the mix as well. Everything moves around slowly. Little areas of low pressure drifting from north to south and this one is weakening to an extent though still enough to bring showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland with one or two showers running through the eastern counties of England. We saw snow overnight. A further dusting is possible across eastern counties in the early part of the day. The coast, more likely rain and sleet. Frost is likely elsewhere. Quite hard in rural spots. Places begin around -6 or -7, perhaps -10 in north-west England where we have got snow cover. Across Northern Ireland, a mix of rain, sleet and snow, some snow could cover places. That’s the story in northern Scotland as well. For most of Scotland it is a cold and frosty start to the day with the odd patch of fog there as well. Eastern England will catch one or two of those sleet and snow showers and they drift southwards with time. As temperatures rise in the sunshine, they turn increasingly rainy through the day. Across northern Scotland, showers fade away, Northern Ireland becomes dry in the afternoon. Temperatures struggle - 2-6 degrees at best. It will feel chilly out there once again. Through Tuesday into Wednesday, if anything, the winds pick up across central and eastern parts. Around this area of high pressure. We see low overnight temperatures with hard frost in places, something like -6 or -7. The blue colours show the frostier start to Wednesday and white speckles. Sleet and snow showers run down the eastern side of England and Scotland on a brisk wind that will have a raw edge to it for eastern parts of the UK. Further west you go, the light winds. Light winds, sunny skies, four or five degrees, not feeling bad. The end of the week is marked by a freshening easterly coming across southern parts of the UK. Light winds across the north.

Now for the latest financial news with Sally and World Business Report. Oil prices rise on speculation the global industry is ready to scale back output and face the reality of a new low price era. Emerging from a crisis in style. As the eurozone’s largest bank opens its books, we ask whether a new boss means a new era for Santander. Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Sally Bu ndock. Also in the programme, another surprise cut in rates from a central bank, this time it’s Australia sending the Aussie dollar to a six year low. We will have the latest from our team over there. First, oil prices are going up, yes, you did hear me correctly. After months of reporting a fall in the price of black gold, have we now hit the bottom? In the last two sessions the price of crude oil has climbed 11.8% with Brent crude now at around $54 a barrel. That follows a seven month rout, which wiped 60% off the price of a barrel of oil, now markets are speculating the last two days marks the start of a price correction. One of the reasons for the move higher is an oil refinery strike in the US which has already lasted two days. The strike is affecting 10% of the US’s refining capacity. But despite these price gains, the need for fundamental change in the oil industry is still clear. Oil companies around the world are looking to make cost savings in the light of a new, lower oil prices era. In a few hours BP is expected to report a fall in profits of 15%. It is also expected to cancel some major new projects. And it’s a similar picture across the industry, where falling investment by the oil majors is squeezing thousands of smaller firms around the globe. From the UAE, Mark Lobel reports. At one of the UAE’s largest oil companies based in Abu Dhabi each of its departments is being ordered to find savings. The directive comes among a weakening jobs market. A recent survey of oil and gas companies in the UAE found a 30% drop in demand for office support, human resources and administration in the past six months. Many of this specialised engineering companies’ workers feel the heat. They are worried because they see their colleagues in other companies getting termination notices, but I’d like to reassure them that the last thing we want to do is terminate anyone. The only things that might be affected are the non-essential support staff. There are some safety factors... In Dubai, small businesses are taking large hits as some Explorer tree oil projects Singh. This consultancy was asked to develop the rig business for a Middle East company sometime ago. -- projects sink. Since the oil price has come down the company asked us to stop the project. If you asked me the percentage, the profit will reduce by approximately 30%. The current environment is a double blow to equipment manufacturers who are already facing fierce competition from Asia. Doing companies are holding onto materials and contractors are seeing pay cuts. With tighter margins, companies are having to become more efficient. The UAE says it will increase oil production by 500,000 barrels over the next few years. For oil related companies, concerns remain. As long as they can cut costs without promoting standards at this precarious time. We will be talking about oil throughout the morning. As soon as BP releases its results in about 1.5 hours we shall update you. Keep your eye on our website as well as we keep you in touch. Also in a few hours, the eurozone’s biggest bank will open its books but will the numbers make the new boss of Santander smile or not? Ana Botin has been global chairman for less than five months and in that time she has already set ambitious new lending targets for the bank and shaken up the banks management. She also aims to accelerate growth in key markets Britain, Spain and the United States. So, can Santander break the cycle of malaise in the Eurozone’s banking sector? With me is Russ Mould, Investment Director, Aj Bell. There are a few things to look out. For 2015, what does the company say? The average analysts are looking for is 40% growth on top of what we saw last year and the third one is there any corporate activity? There were rumours of a bid for an Italian bank, a spin-off of the UK’s operations. It has remained silent on that point. Any other news about big changes would be a surprise at this point? I think it would be. The new management increased its cost-cutting programme in November and then did a big capital raising injanuary to strengthen the budget sheet, give them more money to lend. I don’t think anyone is looking for major drama less than one month after they raised a lot of money from shareholders. To what extent does looking at Santander give us an idea of how banking is this the eurozone? It’s Europe’s biggest bank, and if you look at the nine-month numbers lending growth was 2%. The new management needs to try to drive that higher. They have raised more money and strengthen the balance sheet to do that to lend money you need for lawyers who want to borrow and even in Spain and the UK they might not be as easy to find that the banks think. What do people make of Ana Botin? Of course she isn’t new to Santander. She ran the UK side of the business, which is interesting given the rumours that she might spend a tough, but that would be highly unlikely? But unlikely given she is so close to it. If you are going to be exposed among major Western economies, but Spain, Uganda met-- and America are probably 3D would choose. Spain’s economy is due to grow faster than Brazil’s in 2015 according to the IMF. I think the UK is a strong market for them and I think I would be very surprised if they spin out. Thanks very much. See you soon. We will update you when we hear from Santander. Australia’s central bank has cut interest rate to new record low of 2.25%. This is the first cut in 18 months and sent the Aussie dollar to a six-year low. Let’s get more. Rico Hizonjoins me now from our Asia business hub. We didn’t expect this, did we? Three fifths of economists polled were expecting a rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia. The economy has been sluggish over the past year. The situation has been made tougher by a protracted slowdown in China, Australia’s number one trading partner, accounting for one third of its exports. Shane Oliver in Sydney believes that with these historic low rates, diving oil prices and a weak Aussie dollar, this will surely stimulate the economy. There are a whole bunch of things that will help growth. The fall in petrol prices in Australia is putting about $19 a week, in terms of savings, into the average household. They are getting a lower interest bill, roughly equivalent to about $15 a week savings for someone on an average mortgage and of course the lower Australian dollar will help Australian companies and industries that have to compete internationally, like tourism, manufacturing and so on. So there’s a lot of support for the Australian economy through. This is more like fine tuning. It’s not that Australia has emergency, it’s about taking that insurance to make sure growth does pick up over the next 12 months. The Aussie dollar is slumping but stocks in Australia, one of the few bright spots today, after the central bank cut rates to sharp economic growth. The Sydney benchmark index soaring by 1.3% right now. Thanks very much. just to mention, we just heard the Indian central bank has kept its interest rates on hold. That’s a scheduled meeting where they made that decision. A surprised us a few weeks ago with an unscheduled decision to cut rates as well. In other news, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis are holding talks with their Italian counterparts in Rome on Tuesday. Ricoh mentioned but happening in Australia. And crude to $55 and crude Rico. At the moment shares are going down in Asia but the big winners are at the energy companies and energy-related stocks are doing well. That was the case on Wall Street. You can see the all Aussie dollar there as well. We will take a look at the papers in a moment. First, recent cut in UK energy bills could have been bigger, according to Which? . Research suggest any she firms could cut prices by up to 50% and that households should have saved an average of £145 last year. Here is how industry correspondent. This may like to keep an eye on his bills. His tariff will fall by 5% at the end of the month. He thinks that’s too little too late. It has to be nonsense because wholesale prices have dropped a lot. There’s no reason that the industry there shouldn’t drop the price to the consumer. Which? Estimated how much energy companies are likely to have paid for gas and electricity and compared that to how much they charge their customers. It found that savings of £145 on a standard tariffjoule fuel bill could have been passed onto households last year. -- dual. That equates to savings of £2.9 billion across Britain. They claimed there is room for a further 10% cut in gas and 50% cut in electricity prices this year. Suppliers say they can’t pass on steep falls in wholesale prices immediately. --15%. Because the energy we are using today could have been 40 years ago. They do this to secure supplies and shield households from volatile prices. You can’t suddenly pass the savings on in one chunk. Only as your buying strategy unwinds and you can take advantage of these lower wholesale prices that you can then pass those onto customers. That’s why you are seeing different timings and different percentages. The energy market is now in the middle of major competition investigation. That should tell us once and for all whether consumers have been getting a fair deal or not. Coming up On Breakfast, all of the news, business and sport. This is BBC News. The headlines: judges at the United Nations High Court are preparing to hand down a judgement in the case of Croatia versus Serbia. Both sides accused the other Brierley -- violating the UN’s genocide Convention by deliberately trying to destroy each other during the conflict in the Balkans. The Greek Finance Minister has told the BBC that he is optimistic that an understanding can be reached with Greece’s international creditors, after talks in London. George Osborne warned issue could destabilise the world economy. It is clear that the stand-off between Greece and the eurozone is fast becoming the biggest risk to the global economy and is the rising threat to our economy at home, in Europe as in Britain now is the time to choose competence over chaos. I urge the Greek Finance Minister to act responsibly. The midwest and North East United States have been hit by the second snowstorm in one week. At least seven people have been killed. Flights, schools and businesses have been disrupted and roads remain icy and treacherous. The leader of the Russian backed rebels in eastern Ukraine says he wants to recruit an army of 100,000 men as fighting intensifies. The US says it is considering sending weapons to help the Ukrainian military. Time to look at the newspapers. Sally and I will see which stories are making headlines. Getting with the finance minister from Greece, saying he wants to end the stand-off with creditors by swapping outstanding debt for new bonds. We will find out how radical thatis bonds. We will find out how radical that is in a moment. The Wall Street journal says cheap oil prices are helping japan’s economy bounce back. Analysts in The Moscow Times suggest President Putin remains popular, despite the country’s economic difficulties, because he is personally associated with national pride. The Telegraph business section looks at a move by the British government to take new measures to stop big companies from squeezing the life out of small suppliers. The group bidding for Aer Lingus promises the airline won’t lose its high-value stocks at Heathrow Airport if the Irish government agrees to back the bid, that’s in the companies and markets section of the FT. And American regulators have given a Chinese insurance group the go-ahead to buy a New York hotel. The insurance company will pay 1.5 million dollars for the landmark in Manhattan. joining us isjane Foley, Senior FX strategist at Rabobank. Described as radical, this Greek Finance Minister. He has unveiled this bid and it is quite a complicated exchange of ideas and a potential solution. Can you explain to us what it is, how it will work and... Well, we won’t ask you if it will work. The first thing to say is that there is a deadline. The existing bail out runs out in February. There are four weeks to go. This new Greek government does not want to negotiate. The bail out is with the trigger, the ECB, the IMF and so on. They don’t want to negotiate with them. They want to negotiate with European heads of state. That is why there has been this visit to France and to London and, again, to Rome. Again, like France, a socialist government. He has a populist mandate to say the end of austerity. The people don’t want austerity. And so he is looking for a little bit of love on the terms of this debt bail out. The issue is, as you say, the current bail out runs out at the end of February, and they have debt payments to meet in March estimated to be over $4 billion. Euros, I should say. Many say they could probably find the money to make over until March. If there is no extension with the bail out negotiated, would the ECB continue to fund their banks? Of course, their banks are very much leaning on the ECB right now. They probably would because the ECB does not want to spark a crisis, although that is unresolved. Something does have to be negotiated. And what the Financial Times is reporting today is that at least he has come up with a plan. In terms of the existing bail out, it is already more generous than the terms that were given to Portugal or Ireland in their bail out, but he wants something else. He has come up with a plan and it is really whether or not the other governments agree to it. It involves bonds, doesn’t it. As things stand, they have to pay back their debt within the second term. Again, the terms that were given to them were more generous than those of Ireland and Portugal. They are talking about a perpetual bond. If you talk about that, you never have to repay it. You just pay the interest payments as you go but not the capital sum itself. That would be more attractive to gross. They are talking about a whole menu. -- that would be more attractive to Greece. Things that could be more attractive to Greece and could potentially also take away the risk of another crisis. Watch this space. The Wall Streetjournal is looking at the japanese economy and this mixed picture. The lower oil prices have really helped japan. It imports 90% of its energy needs. If the oil price goes down, of course it will be of nature benefit. But the government also says that the yen is weak enough. -- of course it will be of major benefit. What we have seen over the last year is a massive weakening of the yen, and that means that in putting costs go up, and the government is beginning to say that enough is enough. The weak oil has been a boon but the yen is weakening and import costs are still going out. But afterjapan dropping back into recession in the middle of last year, there are some more positive signs of the agenda, particularly with exports, again suggesting that the weaker yen is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Speaking of weak currencies, let’s talk about the ruble, which has collapsed, basically. And get on the front page of the Moscow Times, there are these delightful plates. I don’t know if your parents ever bought them. I can’t imagine mind buying things like this for Charles and Diana’s wedding... On the significance of these is that Vladimir Putin is still popular. This is very significant. When we consider dissensions on Russia from Europe and the US, they are having a painful impact. -- when we consider the sanctions. Russia is an oil producer as well. And while a drop in the oil price is good for importing nations, it is not good for producers. It hurts in revenue and it hurtsjobs. Russia is falling into quite a deep recession. The Europeans, when they put sanctions on Russia, they thought the economic pain might help Vladimir Putin go back from his position on Ukraine, but actually, he is still very popular. As long as he remains popular, as long as he can blame the problems of Russia on the West, there is no anticipating that he will step back on Ukraine. How has he managed to stay so popular? There is a lot of national pride and he is blaming a lot of what is happening on the West. We will have to see how long that will last however, because the economic pain will not be solved quickly by any means. This is an interesting story about plans to help small businesses and small suppliers in the face of quite difficult decisions made by large companies, some we all know very well, major retailers, and so on, companies not saying suppliers dropped to three months. It is quite tricky if -- not paying suppliers for up to three months. It can be quite tricky if you are a small operator. The example here was a company saying that they would not PGY company saying that they would not pay their supplier for three company saying that they would not pay their supplierfor three months, pay their supplier for three months, which pay their supplierfor three months, which can be quite painfulfor small businesses. The government says that is not good enough and that they will try and stop it and make sure that the payments go to the suppliers much faster. If you look at the UK economy, small businesses are very important for employment growth. And a lotta have become self-employed amid this -- a lot of people have become self-employed amid this slowdown. One major deal we have spoken about over the last two weeks is IAG buying Aer Lingus. Whenever you have a deal like this, there will always be concerns about regulation and what jobs will be lost or what parts of the business will be curtailed. What is the company focusing on? This is about IAG buying Aer Lingus. Or rather, the Irish Cabinet selling its stake in Aer Lingus. It is feared that the Heathrow -- the Irish government selling its stake. It is feared that the Heathrow slots might be sold. As much as Ireland is concerned, it wants to remain linked to the UK. UK is a massive trade base for the Irish economy. And so there has been a compromise put on the table and it is that those slots will be guaranteed to remain as they are or five years. But there is still concerned that may not be enough and after five years, those slots might be given away. The head of IAG used to be the chief executive officer of British Airways. He does want this deal. He says he will promise this and that in exchange for them going along. The Waldorf Astoria, a landmark in New York, is being sold to the Chinese. Yes. There is that and there is also the story that China is eating up a lot of prime assets in the West. That is one story. The other story in the support is that there are reports about divergent information about Anbang’s links with certain families. The Chinese insurance company buying the hotel? It is good for the company and the question that I’m more interested in is how many acids are going to China. I don’t think it will be the last one. -- how many assets are going to China. Thank you forjoining us. We will see you later. Goodbye. We will keep the wintry theme going for the rest of this week. A cold start of the day with a widespread frost and even some snow in the mix as well. Everything is moving around pretty slowly, mind you. Heavy showers across Scotland will slowly fade, as will the mix of rain, snow and sleet showers across Northern Ireland. We saw some WE SBW SOITIE SFIOW a further dusting is possible. Towards the coast, perhaps it is more likely to be rain or sleet and snow. Frost is much more likely elsewhere. Especially in the countryside, where a few places start the day as low as -10 degrees in north-west England. Rain, sleet and snow in Northern Ireland. And thatis and snow in Northern Ireland. And that is the story across northern Scotland as well. Most of Scotland will have a cold and frosty start to the day with a patch of fog as well. Showers will drift southwards over time but as temperatures begin to rise in the sunshine, they will turn increasingly more to rain through the course of the day. Temperatures will struggle. Six degrees at best and it will feel pretty chilly out there once again. Through Tuesday into Wednesday, if anything, the wind will increase across central and eastern parts, around this area of high pressure. We will see some low overnight temperatures and hard frost in a number of places as temperatures drop as low as minus seven degrees. The blue areas show us the frost to begin on Wednesday. Also some snow showers running down the east side. On a brisk wind, they will have a raw edge. The further west you go, the light the wind. The end of the week is marked by a freshening easterly wind, coming in across southern parts of the UK. Lighter winds across the north. # When I see your face # There’s not a thing that I would change # Cos you’re amazing # just the way you are... # Raaarrr! # And when you smile # The whole world stops and stares for a while... # This year for Red Nose Day, do something truly amazing. # Live to fight again. # MUSIC: Mr Blue Sky by ELO Sends shivers down your spine.

First, our main story: MPs will vote today on whether to allow the creation of babies with DNA from three people. The technique aims to help prevent serious and often life-threatening genetic diseases being passed on by the mother. Britain would be the only country in the world to offer the procedure, but church leaders have urged them not to. Our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh reports. Pvppv Poppy is nearly four, and has mitochondrial disease. An inherited genetic condition. She cannot walk and struggles with her speech. Her sister Lily is that. MPs are being asked to approve a technique which would enable couples at risk to have a healthy baby by using a tiny amount of donor DNA from a second woman. I think a change in the law to allow this procedure to take place well, you know, definitely give out two girls and important option, I suppose, give out two girls and important option, Isuppose, in option, I suppose, in the future. And hope that we can stop mitochondrial disease spreading. It is inherited, it will pass down the female line. While some have dubbed it three parent IVF, the reality is any baby born as a result of this technique will have all the key genetic material from its mother and father, affecting appearance and personal traits. The donation will be treated rather like an organ transplant, and be completely anonymous. But unlike a donor organ this DNA will be passed from generation to generation. A permanent change to the human genetic code. The technique has been opposed by church leaders. Critics have called it a slippery slope to designer babies. But it has the backing of government and major scientific bodies. The science and safety data are there. The families want this. And I suppose the question is, why would we allow these families to still suffer, when we have it in our hands to do otherwise? If approved, we have it in our hands to do otherwise? Ifapproved, clinics otherwise? If approved, clinics will be free to apply for a licence. And ",,

And with many of us seeing snow this morning, we’ll get a full weather forecast just after 1:30pm. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Should doctors be allowed to create babies using the DNA from three people? Scientists say the technique, which would use genetic material from a mother, a father and a donor woman, could prevent serious illnesses being passed from a mother to her baby. But opponents say the move could be unsafe and could set a dangerous precedent. MPs are about to start begin debating a change to the law. It means the UK could become the first country to formally legalise three-person babies, helping around 150 couples a year. Here’s our Medical Correspondent, Fergus Walsh. Poppy is nearly four and has mitochondrial disease, an inherited genetic condition. She cannot walk and she struggles with her speech. Her sister Lily is not affected. MPs are being asked to approve a technique which would enable couples at risk, to have a healthy baby by using a tiny amount of donor DNA from a second woman. I think a change in the law to allow this procedure to take place, would definitely give our girls an important option I suppose, in the future, and hope we can stop mitochondrial disease from spreading. It will pass down the female line. Server them when they want to think about having children, they would have the opportunity to have a healthy child -- have the opportunity to have a healthy child -- so for them. The key DNA shapes the of the children, and that would be removed, leaving behind the mitochondria. When the power pack -- behind the mitochondria. When the power pack -- Power packs for cells are damaged, Aiken pass on diseases from Brian Blessed -- are damaged, Aiken pass on diseases from Brian Blessed -- blindness, heart failure. This embryo will have 22,000 genes from the parents, and just 37 genes from the donor. That genetic change will be passed on to future generations. The technique is currently illegal in the UK and some other countries. Many others have no rules at all. Critics say it is a dangerous step. What really worries me is the legal principle of manipulating a child’s genes that is passed down the generations. That would be a world first, and it would be a break of the international community and many people outside of the country think that this is Britain being incredibly irresponsible. After several scientific reviews, the change in the law has the firm backing of medical research bodies and government. The families want this, and I suppose the question is, why would we allow these families to still suffer when we have it in our hands to do otherwise? If approved, clinics will be free to apply for a licence and the first baby could be born next year. How significant is the vote? Hugely significant, especially for the families as there are 150 couples a year at risk of passing on life-threatening illnesses, and they will be able to have healthy children, notjust their children, but their children’s children. This would be a permanent genetic fix passed down the generations. Secondly, for society, this is what is known as a germ line change. It is something that cannot be undone. In years to come we will have children walking around with an extra tiny bit of DNA from a third person. The donors will be treated like a blood transfusion or organ donor, so they won’t have any legal status, or organ donor, so they won’t have any legalstatus, but any legal status, but it is important because it is the germ line change that will be passed down from generation to generation. What about the concerns of the critics that we heard? Ethical concerns that this could be a slippery slope to designer babies, and instead of designing out of the faults, you could be designing attributes like intelligence on athletic ability, that sort of thing. And also concerns that it might be unsafe -- and athletic ability. I don’t know of a proposed treatment that has come under such scrutiny, a consultation, and ethical review, and all of the lab work suggests it is safe. We will not know it is safe for certain until it happens. English MPs will be able to scrutinise and veto laws that would only apply in England, under plans being put forward by the Conservatives. But MPs from other parts of the UK would then be allowed to take part in a final vote on the measures. It’s one of the proposals being forward by the Conservatives in response to the vote on Scottish independence. Here’s our Political Correspondent, Robin Brant. This is your parliament in action, as seen in a rare behind-the-scenes BBC Two documentary to be shown tonight. All of the MPs, no matter where they are from or who they are, are supposed to be equal, except that is not actually the case. That is because it has been giving away power, devolving it, for years. The Scottish Parliament has been given the most. Take hospitals, Edinburgh now decides what happens in the Scottish NHS, and English NHS -- what happens in the Scottish NHS, and English NHS -- MPs have no power, but when it comes to hospitals in England, Scottish MPs in Westminster still have a say. It’s going that way on some taxes as well. The Scottish Parliament after the next election will be able to vote on income tax rates, air passenger duty in Scotland, and we are saying it would not be acceptable for them to come to Westminster and impose higher tax and air passenger duty to people in England. This is a means of addressing the problem. The Conservatives want to change you could vote on English law. Under their plan, only wish MPs would debate and change anything that would affect England only -- debate and change anything that would affect England only -- only English MPs. That would mean an English only veto on who could run a school in England. But ultimately all UK MPs would take part in the final vote in parliament. The truth is, this doesn’t appear to be what David Cameron was offering in the days after the Scottish referendum victory. Some on his own side think it has been watered down and it is a halfway house. For Labour, they see it as a stitch up. It is clear that this is a highly political announcement by William Hague that says more about the war on the Tory backbenches and it does about a proper changing constitution, including devolving power in England as well as the rest of the UK, and looking at how we have additional English scrutiny of laws. Labour has its own problems. It doesn’t want less power Scottish MPs it might rely on if it wins the election. Now though, this is all talk in the run-up to the election. The chances of a change before May are are very unlikely. Our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith, is in Westminster. Norman, are these plans likely to satisfy English MPs who are unhappy with the current system? ~ I think William Hague can afford himself a huge sigh of relief that a general election looms, because otherwise I think there would have been a right old rumpus on the Tory backbenches because many Conservatives remain deeply unhappy. Why? Because they say this is not what they were promised by David Cameron in the aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum, this is not English votes for English laws because, yes, English MPs will have a veto to stop any legislation being imposed on them, but MPs throughout the UK will still be able to take part in debates, to amend legislation and to vote on legislation. They are also unhappy because it is too complex. You have to be a Parliamentary nerd to understand how the system will work. How on earth do we sell it to the voters, and because of that complexity they fear it provides all sorts of room for people, perhaps like Scottish National party MPs, who want to cause a bit of Parliamentary mischief. But this is just the Conservative proposal. The Liberal Democrats have their own ideas, and the Labour Party have their ideas. Which means, I’m afraid, the answer to the English question could still be an awfully long way off. Norman Smith there. The fall in the price of fuel has hit BP. The company reported its profits were down 20% for the first three months of last year compared to the same time the year before. As a result, BP said it would be cutting the amount of money it spent on exploration. The cost of a barrel of oil has more than halved over the last two years. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed is with me. Not good news for BP, but low oil price is good for the consumers? I havejust spent an price is good for the consumers? I have just spent an hour with Bob Godley from BP, and he said it was good news for consumers. -- Godley from BP, and he said it was good news for consumers. -- Bob Dudley. Written is an energy importing country and we have all seen the decline is at the petrol pumps of 30p a litre -- seen the decline is at the petrol pumps of 30p a litre -- Britain is an energy importing country. Bob Dudley was pretty grim about the future for BP, a big employer in the UK with more than 3000 people employed in the North Sea. He said the North Sea was looking like a tough environment. He was not expecting any increase in oil price over the next two or three years, so the tough environment will continue. Also BP has big business interests in Russia, and Russia has been struggling because of Ukraine and the foil -- struggling because of Ukraine and the foil -- four in the oil prices and the drop in the ruble. And deepwater horizon, a tragedy when II oil workers were killed and millions of barrels of oil were leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, there are still big fines ahead on the issue for BP, so clearly some major challenges for that very big company. The performance of Scotland’s Accident and Emergency service has worsened, according to the latest figures. Between October and December, 91% of patients were treated within four hours, compared to 94% the previous quarter. Our Scotland Correspondent, Laura Bicker, reports. From the moment a patient arrives, the clock is ticking. Notjust From the moment a patient arrives, the clock is ticking. Not just to get them the care they need, but to ensure they are not waiting too long for treatment. At this hospital in Dundee, they are doing well. 99% of patients are seen in four hours with the help of a specialist unit. It works to relieve pressure at the front door and helps prevent unnecessary admissions to hospital. But even here, winter has been a challenging time. Not only do we see a larger volume of patients at this time, the degree and severity of illness of that population is starkly different and it would be in the summer months. Waiting times this winter have been longer for patients. Across Scotland, 91% of patients are being seen within the four hour time frame. That is still not meeting the Scottish Government target of 95%, and it’s a slightly poorer performance than those in England. But waiting can take its toll. 85-year-old Cathy was in an acute treatment centre overnight in Glasgow. Her daughter said she was not sent to award until the late afternoon. -- not sent to award until the late afternoon. -- to a ward. It was 12 or 13 hours, waiting all that time, she became more distressed as time went on. She was sore, lying there all that time as well. It is upsetting for myself and the family to see her like that. The Scottish Government says it does have a plan to tackle waiting times. Obviously, more work to be done, and we want to get to the 95%, and then 98% of patients being seen within four hours, and we have a huge number of actions to do that, not least the £100 million weight put in to tackle delayed discharge, because we know it has an impact on A&E. The NHS has become a battle ground ahead of the general election, but patients in the worst affected area say they want to see improvements whoever is in charge. Let’s speak to our Health Editor, Hugh Pym, who’s in Edinburgh. We now have comparable figures for around the UK. What is the overall picture? If you like, it’s the last piece of the jigsaw for the UK. In the first part of winter, October, UP the first part of winter, October, up until December, we have had the figures from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the figures show something broadly comparable to England, maybe a bit behind on the performance of the four hour wait for overall attendances, but very much the same pressures as around the UK with record numbers of attendances, record numbers of emergency admissions, problems with delayed discharges, getting patients back into the community and finding social care places and funding for them and so on. That is a broadly, double situation. Interestingly, if you look at major accident and emergency unit, those dealing with the biggest problems, the real emergency cases, the Scottish a and E units in that category performed slightly better than those in England and Wales -- slightly better than those in England and Wales -- A&E units. Not a huge amount, but a bit better. The Scottish Government says there is no room for complacency, and they are pleased that with all of these pressures their staff have worked extremely hard over the winter, but they acknowledge they have to work harder to get back to their 95, then 98% target. Scottish Labour are saying that this is not good enough and the situation has got worse, and more investment is needed. If you look at certain areas in Scotland, like Tayside, they are meeting this very stretching 98% target patients being seen in four hours in A&E units and they say the answer is a joined up approach across the communities with doctors, pharmacists and doctors at a cute hospitals working together to provide the best options so you don’t get so many people coming into A&E units. Many thanks. In the last few minutes it has been confirmed the BBC has lost the rights to the coverage of the Open, golf’s oldest Championship. It will be shown on sky sports. Katherine Downes reports. john Daly will be the champion. Almost six decades of moments like this. But from next year, there will be no live coverage of the Open on free to air television. 5 million people watched Rory Mcllroy lift the Claret jug on people watched Rory Mcllroy lift the Claretjug on BBC One last summer. On pay for view television, Sky can only expect a fraction of that audience. By awarding the rights to the open to sky, there is a decision about the future of golf. With the millions Sky are paying, there will be millions more to pump back into the game. But with fewer people watching the action live, it may mean fewer people are inspired by the likes of Rory Mcllroy to actually get out and try golf, a sport which has been in serious decline in recent years. In a competitive market, the BBC recently paid over £200 million to renew its deal for Match Of The Day. In 2013, it won back rights to shared the FA Cup coverage with BT Sport. Sky already has a large and highly regarded portfolio of live golf coverage. Including the Ryder Cup. Their investment and expertise in the game has paid off. The BBC’s bid for the Open was bigger than the last deal but Sky’s pockets are deep. The BBC will show highlights but for golf’s oldest major, it is time to change channels. We will have more on that in our sports bulletin late in the programme. Our top story this lunchtime: MPs will vote this afternoon on whether to allow the creation of babies with DNA from three people. And still to come - why birds of a feather really do flock together. Coming up in sport at half-past: Cristiano Ronaldo will end his career with Real Madrid according to his agentjorge Mendes. He tells us Ronaldo is the world’s greatest sportsman and worth a billion euros on the transfer market. It’s four weeks since Islamist militants attacked a town in north-east Nigeria. What happened next in Baga has been the subject of much debate. Initial reports suggested that up to 2,000 people had been massacred by the fighters of Boko Haram. Some say it was nearer 150. Now for the first time, survivors have been describing how the attackers were forced to retreat, after residents took up arms to defend their homes. Our correspondent Thomas Fessy, and a BBC team travelled to Chad to speak to some of the survivors. One month on and after the fall of Baga, the story of what happened there is still untold. We travelled to Lake Chad, to hear from the survivors who fled the Boko Haram onslaught. Thisjourney takes survivors who fled the Boko Haram onslaught. This journey takes us to one of the many Lake Islands, just a short boat ride away from the border with Nigeria. So what happened in Baga? Boko Haram fighters stormed through the west side of the town, minutes after early prayers. TRANSLATION: All the youth came out to fight. We took our machetes and thatis to fight. We took our machetes and that is how we first pushed them back into the bush. But we started to flee when we saw the number of vehicles they were coming back with. Islamist militants returned, stronger. Women, children and men ran to the nearby fishing town of Doron Baga. The shooting was indiscriminate. Houses and trees were burned down. Families have been separated. Nearly 15,000 refugees have arrived here in Chad, over the last month, terrified. TRANSLATION: I was in school when Boko Haram came after us. They burned everything. We left my father and my little brother behind. The soldiers threw away their weapons, behind. The soldiers threw away theirweapons, some their weapons, some threw them into the water or onto the ground. The vigilantes took the weapons that were firing back. It was impossible to count the number of dead bodies. There were so many. Women, men and children all killed. When I was running, they were hunting us. Some people were falling and dying, others being run over with motorbikes. Some reached the banks of the lake and they were shelling us. We heard that our houses had been burned down and all our possessions had been burned. It was not possible to go back and get our belongings. The fire was raging. Boko Haram still occupies Baga, preventing those who have escaped from returning home. In the last month, the insurgents have attacked more towns. More people have died and more people have been forced to flee their homes. A murderer who appealed against spending the rest of his life in prison has been told his sentence wasn’t a violation of his human rights. Arthur Hutchinson was convicted in 1984 for murder, rape and burglary. He argued the sentence amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment, as there was no prospect of release. But today the European Court of Human Rights rejected his appeal. Let’s speak to our Legal Affairs correspondent, Clive Coleman. European court judgements are often controversial here. How has this one been received? It depends on your view. In 2013, the grand chamber of the Strasbourg court, ruled that whole life sentences, those reserved for people like Mark Bridger who murdered five-year-old Apriljones, that those sentences were in breach of human rights and amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. Thatjudgement was inhuman and degrading treatment. That judgement was controversial. The Conservatives cited that judgement in plans to scrap the Human Rights Act, to ensure our Parliament was not bound by decisions from the Strasbourg court. There was no review mechanism. Last year, the Court of Appeal looked at this again and looked up powers the justice Secretary had to release those prisoners in exceptional circumstances. It had been used when people were terminally ill, when they had just a few weeks to live. But the court said it is complied with human rights. So good news for the relationship between the British courts and Strasbourg. Not so good if you like a bit of distance between them. The widow of Alexander Litvinenko has been giving evidence at the inquiry into his death. She broke down in tears as she described the last days of his life. Our Security Correspondent, Gordon Corera, is at the Royal Courts ofjustice. Clearly distressing for Mrs Litvinenko? It was. She wiped away tears as she recalled the night when he fell ill. At first they thought it was food poisoning. He got progressively worse over the next few days. The first ambulance did not take him to hospital. His hair began to fall out and she kept it in a plastic bag by his bed in hospital. We also heard about previous threats to him. In 1992 he received any mail from a former colleague warning him that he should get his will ready in advance. Also, pictures of him being shot at by Russian soldiers in training and an image of him being used as target practice. More evidence from Arena this afternoon as well as her son. Thank you. The Food Standards Agency is looking into the alleged mistreatment of animals at a halal slaughterhouse in North Yorkshire. Hidden cameras appear to show sheep being kicked and hit at the Bowood Lamb abattoir in Thirsk. Danjohnson has this report, and it does include images that some viewers may find upsetting. This is a place where animals are supposed to be killed, according to strict religious rules. But look how the workers treat the cheap. They are thrown around, smashed against walls, even taunted with knives before they are killed -- walls, even taunted with knives before they are killed -- how they are killed -- before they are killed -- how they are killed -- how the workers treat the sheep. Some of it is too upsetting to show. Under the halal code, they should receive one single cut, but the BDO shows slaughter men hacking cheap repeatedly. This footage was filmed by Animal Aid. I am shocked by this investigation but I am not surprised. We have seen similarfootage and I am not surprised. We have seen similar footage and other slaughterhouses. While it is awful to see sheep being picked up and thrown, it is something everyone should be shocked about. These images from halal abattoir, which unlike most does not stun animals before they are killed, is likely to reopen the debate about religious slaughter practices. The Muslim Council of Britain has stressed the findings are abhorrent in Islamic practice and the abattoir must be subject to the full force of the law. A report last week from the Food Standards Agency suggested that conditions in slaughterhouses had dramatically improved in recent years. But after seeing how animals were treated here, they have now launched an investigation. The slaughterhouse management says it does not tolerate any abuse of animals. The abattoir continues to maintain the very high standards they always have done and in any business, if one person makes a mistake, it is not the end of the business, it is very important that the business deals with that properly and that is exactly what has happened. One of these slaughter men has been dismissed. The other three have had their licences suspended. The Food Standards Agency says it may take legal action. Animal rights groups warn that abuse is a much wider problem in slaughterhouses of all kinds. It won’t be long before the flocks of birds that flew south for the winter will start to return to their breeding grounds here in the UK. Now scientists have discovered that birds that fly in that familiar V-formation take it in turns to lead the flock - so that the ones behind can save their energy. Our science correspondent, Victoria Gill, explains how. For a large, heavy birds, flying is tough. It consumes so much energy that many don’t survive their first migration. These northern ibises fly in a V shaped like geese. The aim of this study was to find out how birds solve the dilemma of which one takes the very tiring lead. Scientists worked with the conservation team in Austria and trained these captive bred birds to migrate. They fitted each ibis with a data logger to monitor their movements as they flew. This showed that the birds worked in pairs, taking turns to lead and follow. By essentially pairing up with one other member of the flock, the birds were able to have their formation constantly shift around, like a cycling peloton, to allow every ibis to have a rest. It seems we can learn lessons from these birds. The more we learn about these birds, the better we can conserve them but also for us as humans, the information we are getting from studying these birds is helping airline companies work out how they can save fuel which will save us money when we fly round the world. Researchers think this simple method, working in twos, could be behind a lot more cooperation in the animal kingdom. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today - MPs will vote this afternoon on whether to allow the creation of babies with DNA from three people. In a moment, john Hammond will be here with a full national weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first with all the day’s sport, here’s Hugh Woozencroft at the BBC Sports Centre. Let’s get more on the announcement that Sky has secured exclusive TV rights to show the open golf tournament from 2017, meaning the BBC will show only highlights only. Andy, what more can you tell us? It is a significant moment for golf, and The Open has been on the BBC for nearly 60 years, so why has it gone to Sky? Sky has very deep pockets and we understand that the BBC bit more but they were outbid by Sky. It will be a controversial move at the time when golf participation figures are struggling, down 20,000 over the last year alone, and some people will feel that without the shop window of a major championship on to wrest real TV, the trend will continue. The golf governing body issued an statement saying that it would allow them to give increased financial support to the participation initiatives in the UK and Ireland, survey clearly feel it is in the best interests of the of golf. -- is in the best interests of the of golf. -- so they clearly feel. The BBC, this is a disappointment, but they will point to the fact they have highlights on prime-time TV live coverage on radio. Rory McIlroy’s court case against his former agent will resume at the Irish High Court within the next half an hour. He’s suing Horizon Sports Management following a multi-million euros dispute. Our Ireland correspondent Chris Buckler is in Dublin. The case was due to start this morning but has been put back to this afternoon, and that is to give the lawyers time to talk.

But it is a contest in court rather than on the course that is the current focus of Rory McIlroy’s attention. And at stake in this legal dispute is millions of pounds. just over three years ago, Matt Allwright signed a deal with -- three years ago, Matt Allwright signed a deal with -- Rory Mcllroy signed a deal with Horizon, and the firm successfully secured him several big-money sponsorship deals. But Rory McIlroy’s lawyers say the contract with Horizon was signed on the day of a party of what they have described as great informality. He is trying to get it ruled invalid and unenforceable. In response, Horizon, which was founded by Conor Ridge, is reselling for millions of pounds in unpaid fees. It is hard when two sides cannot see things the same and see it differently. It is what it is, and the only way to sort it out is to get a judge to comment and tell us what to do. After victory at the Dubai Desert classic at the weekend, Rory Mcllroy is now hoping to win this legal battle, but no matter the result, the case could lay bare the financial and legal affairs of one of the world’s best-known sportsmen. Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent says the three-times World Footballer of the Year will finish his career at Real Madrid. As Premier League spending topped £130 million in the january transfer window, Ronaldo is one player who’s apparently priceless. Agentjorge Mendes told our Sports Editor Dan Roan, that Ronaldo is unique. Cristiano Ronaldo Cristia no Ronaldo is Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player ever in the world. Give me a number.

He loves the Manchester United supporters, he told me. He was there six years, and he is at Real Madrid, but he will not leave. That is all the sport for now. Let’s take a look at the weather. Many a child would have flung open the curtains and seen a scene like this, the first snow of winter, and the first bought two winters for some of us, and a magical scene, and the reason for that was a blob of snow that came down overnight, it tracks down through the Midlands, into southern England, including the London area, including Hampshire and Wilts, and talking Wilts, this was the scene in Salisbury early on. The snow is beginning to melt, but only slowly, because it is cold out there. A lot of sunshine, and a brisk wind is carrying sleet showers across eastern counties. Some wintry showers, some freezing fog patches as well keeping temperatures down, and at best, four or 5 degrees, despite the sunshine. Overnight, temperatures falling away quickly and ice will be a hazard. Further wintry showers pushing into eastern areas of England and the clearest skies will be further west. Where ever you are, first thing in the morning, watch out for ice, particularly where snow has been melting by day because it will freeze overnight. Across western areas where the skies are clear, temperatures in some spots like Northern Ireland, Wales and the south-west potentially as low as -7 but generallyjust below freezing. More cloud across eastern areas and further wintry showers. Rain or sleet near the coast, snow inland, but by day it will probably melt because of the sunshine between the showers but it will feel cold in the breeze across the eastern counties, but that said, a lot of places with a fine day and it will cloud up across the North of Scotland with patchy rain arriving here. Temperatures at four or five that the best for most of us. Into Thursday, he gets colder across eastern counties and the showers will turn to sleet or snow. A lot of dry weather around, but generally cloudy across the North, particularly in Scotland and there will be patchy rain here. We talked about the cold when developing across eastern counties, and that is because we will get a squeeze between high pressure in the North and low pressure in the southern parts of Europe. It is that squeeze that will generate some strong and bitter winds. You can see how cold the temperatures are across the continent, and that will surge across southern counties of the UK. By the end of the week, bitter winds, still some snow showers, and further north, calmer and drier, but for all of us the next few days and nights, look out for a widespread frost and keep an eye on the weather warnings. A lot going on. A reminderof the A reminder of the top story this lunch time: MPs will vote this afternoon on whether to allow the creation of babies with DNA from three people.

The Chief Executive of the UK’s National Hospital for Spinal Surgery has warned it’s on the brink of closure, because it’s being forced to treat patients in what he describes as ""Third World"" conditions. Rob Hurd of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore says his staff are providing top quality care in buildings that aren’t fit for purpose. Sarah Harris reports. It may be world class when it comes to the treatment of complex orthopaedic problems, but the buildings at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore are anything but.

It is a miracle they get things up and down. This was a temporary measure in the Second World War to take the troops from battlefields. Managers at the hospital say they have been waiting years to start building programme on the site in north London. But they are afraid that the green light might come too late. What we are concerned about is that over the long term, the buildings are dying, and the ability to service the needs of the patients is declining, and that will mean the break-up of a national centre of excellence. We are concerned about that long-term outlook for the hospital. The trust says £80 million was earmarked by the government for building on the site, around the time of the last election. But they say they have spend that amount of money and more in the year since thenjust keeping the buildings here safe. The Department of Health said this matter was in the hands of the trust development agency, and it says that the right solution must be affordable and offer value for money, and that a business case will be assessed once it is received.

Mainly in Surrey we had heavy snow in the early hours of this morning, but this afternoon it seems to have just about disappeared, but it is cold and we will get some bright spells. We have already seen glimmers of sunshine and the possibility of one or two showers and they could fall a little wintry through the afternoon but not too many, three or four Celsius being the maximum, so still bitterly cold. The Met Office has a yellow weather warning for further snow and ice, and we could see snow showers working their way in and turning more to snow as we had through the night as the temperature drops slightly but it is more a risk of ice that could be difficult with tricky driving conditions on untreated roads surfaces and pavements could become slippery as the minimum temperature drops below zero. A similar start of the day tomorrow, Chile with perhaps one or two icy stretches around. Still one or two showers as well and they could turn a little wintry. We have one or two sunny spells, and the breeze will be picking up as we had through tomorrow afternoon and become bitterly cold as it starts to come in from the north-east.

The controversial technique will stop babies like jessica inheriting a disease that has dramatically reduced her life expectancy. It’s just mind-boggling, what this could mean for our family and other families who are affected by mitochondrial disease. It’s just the best news. The move has been backed by a clear majority of MPs . We’ll have the full details.

On BBC London: jailed for preparing acts of terrorism, the student whojoined rebel forces in Syria and posed with guns. And the new planning rules which could see councils lose millions from a fund to build affordable homes. fan has been telling how hisjaw was fractured and he lost two teeth. Good evening and welcome to the BBC’s News at Six. The UK is set to become the first country in the world to legalise the creation of IVF babies using genetic material from three people. MPs have voted on the issue with a majority of 254. The IVF technique involves taking a small amount of DNA from a second woman, in order to stop devastating mitochondrial diseases that seriously limit life expectancy from being passed down. It will help around 150 couples a year. Here’s our Medical Correspondent, Fergus Walsh. jessica, it’s time for food. A landmark day for medical science, and for couples like Victoria and Keith, from Buckinghamshire, who hope to be among the first to benefit from an historic change in the law. Their daughterjessica has a devastating inherited condition. She is brain-damaged, can’t swallow, so needs to be tube fed. jessica is not expected to live beyond a few years. Ijust don’t believe that we should bring another child into the world that could suffer the way jessica has. Iam world that could suffer the way jessica has. I am 38 and I will be 39 injune, so this really is our final option in terms of having a child that we know is free of the disease. Motion number six on human fertilisation and embryology. MPs were given a free vote on what is a matter of conscience, and they backed the change by a 3 to one majority. This is a bold step for Parliament today, but it is a considered and informed step. This is world leading science, within a highly respected regulatory regime. And for the many families affected, this is light at the end of a very dark tunnel. That is exactly the point I was about to make dock but in an impassioned debate, some argued that it would be a dangerous and irreversible step. Once the genie is out of the bottle, once these procedures that we are being asked to authorise today go ahead, there will be no going back for society. We need proper research and considered research. If this was genetically modified crops, we would be up in arms. So how would his pioneering IVF treatment works? From a newly created embryo, the nucleus from an affected couple would be removed. This would leave behind the faulty mitochondrial of the mother. These provide energy to cells, and went damaged, they can pass on devastating diseases to a child, causing muscle wasting, brain damage, heart failure or blindness. The parents’ nucleus, which contains all the key genes which shape appearance and character traits, would be transferred to a second woman’s donor embryo containing only its healthy mitochondria. Crucially, the tiny amount of DNA from the donor would be passed down the generations, a permanent change to that family’s genetic heritage. The scientist who will be the first to apply for a licence to treat couples says there will be strict safeguards. I don’t think this is a slippery slope. I think this is an important advancement in medicine to allow women to have healthy children. And forjessica’s parents, delight. It is mind-boggling what this could mean for our family and otherfamilies who are this could mean for our family and other families who are affected by mitochondrial disease. It is the best news. This is a hugely significant moment, notjust for this family, but for science and society, allowing the DNA from three people to create a child, a genetic change that will passed down the generations. Fergus, this will affect small numbers of people, but it will transform lives. It will. About 150 couples a year, and it will help them, their children and their children’s children. It will be a permanent fix. The donor will be legally anonymous, treated like a blood transfusion or an organ transplant. But the difference is that that extra donor DNA will be passed down the generations. It cannot be undone. There have been several scientific reviews. This has the broad support of medical bodies, and there has been opposition from the church. But despite that, science has won today and Britain is now leading the world in treatments for fertility and genetics. Fergus, thank you. Islamic State extremists have released a video which shows the captured jordanian pilot being burnt to death. Moaz al-Kasasbeh was shot down in December during American-led air operations against Islamic State in Syria. Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, has more details. Murdered by his captors in the most horrific way imaginable. jordan’s captured pollen, lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh, has been burned alive by the jihadists of Islamic State, imprisoned in a cage. Tonight, jordan is coming to terms with the news. This is something that you have to face. We have faced terror organisations since the 70s, but this has been the worst we have ever seen. I think it has been the worst the world has seen. For weeks, the pilot’s family and supporters had been pushing their government to negotiate his release, unaware that he was probably already dead. jordan offered to give up a convicted Al-Qaeda bomber in exchange, but it seems Islamic State always had other plans. The video, too graphic to show, rails against the coalition strikes that are causing them such damage. President Obama has been among the first to react. Whatever ideology they are operating off of, it is bankrupt. We are here to talk about how to make people healthier and make their lives better, and this organisation appears only interested in death and destruction. The pilot’s father, seen here outside the King’s palace a few days ago, could only criticise jordan both for not doing enough to win his son’s release and for taking part in the US led air strikes. This, he said, was notjordan’s war. That issue is now set to become even more contentious as Islamic State’s video threatens alljordanian and Arab pilots who are bombing them, revealing details of names, addresses and rewards for killing them. Hank Gardner, BBC News. -- Frank Gardner. Our North America Editor, jon Sopel, is in Washington for us. President Obama was among the first to respond after this brutal murder. What else has the White House had to say? Yes, you responded quickly. The president also said it is one more indication of the viciousness and barbarity of this organisation. He goes on, it will double the vigilant and determination on the part of the global coalition to make sure they are degraded and ultimately defeated. His words come as the same time as King Abdullah is in Washington, DC. He was due to meet the vice president this afternoon as well as congressional leaders at Capitol Hill. I am wondering whether that agenda will change now, with the King possibly deciding that it is time to return tojordan more quickly than he had originally anticipated as a result of this killing. Of course, jordan has been under strong pressure at home over its decision to support the US. john, thank you. They’re websites that are supposed to find you the lowest tariffs for your energy bills. But instead, the bosses of the five biggest price comparison sites have been accused of failing to show the cheapest deals for customers. MPs on the energy select committee also discovered that the websites earn up to £30 in commission every time a customer switches provider. Our business correspondent Simon Gompertz reports. Millions of us are resorting to price comparison websites to try to get a better deal, but MPs accuse them of not always telling customers about the cheapest offers, especially when they’re being paid commission. Is it wrong to conceal from customers the best available deal, yes or no? I think it is wrong to hide the best available deal. Lined up in front of the energy select committee were the bosses of the top five comparison sites, facing the charge that people had lost out from being pushed towards suppliers which paid commission. I think it’s wrong to say that people are losing money. 99% of customers using confused.com made a saving over previous tariffs. 99.1%. So WE SAVE people TT’IOI’1ây. The websites revealed the commissions, from £22 to £30, which they get each time you switch. That is paid per fuel, so up to £60 for switching gas and electricity at the same time. The nub of this is the choice you get given when you get onto the price comparison website. Some will now show you all your options as a matter of course, but others, and this is one of them, we’ll show you the whole market if that’s what you want, but the first option they show you is only the plans which they can help you to switch to, and those are mainly the ones for which they get a commission. It’s a young industry, whose growth has been based on a business model that involves systematically and deliberately misleading customers about what is in their interests. Under fire, the websites tried to shift blame to energy companies, saying that they stopped cheap offers being shown to their own customers. Some of the big six will not allow us to switch consumers onto a cheaper tariff if they are already with that provider. At various times, that has included British Gas, E.ON and EDF. That is something British Gas denies. MPs want apologies. There are lots of customers here probably watching this today who are saying it’s time these people said sorry. It doesn’t stop there. The comparison sites now face further investigation into their pricing tactics from the Competition and Markets Authority. Simon Gompertz, BBC News. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. The Ukranian Army is evacuating people from the town of Debaltseve after heavy shelling by pro-Russian seperatists. Residents are under artillery fire and have no central heating and little gas, as temperatures drop to below zero. Profits at BP are down 20% this year due to falling oil prices.

English votes for English laws - that’s what the Conservatives are calling plans drawn up to balance extra powers for Holyrood in the wake of the Scottish referendum. Under the proposals, English MPs would be able to veto laws on English-only matters - like income tax. But the final vote would still be held among MPs from across the UK. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, reports. Oxford, as English as it gets. But should Scottish MPs have a say over Oxford’s hospitals, its schools, its transport and even the tuition fees its students pay? When English MPs have no similar say in Scotland? What concerns me is that the Scottish MPs have a say in my country, and I don’t have a say in theirs. It doesn’t really concern me, itjust seems illogical. English people should be voting on the things that only affect the English. After promising Scotland more powers during the independence referendum, David Cameron also promised to listen to the voices of England. Today, his First Minister explained what that meant. The Prime Minister and I have decided that the option we will put forward to Parliament and the country will be one that gives an effective veto to English MPs over matters only affecting England, or England and Wales, while maintaining the integrity of the United Kingdom Parliament. Under the plans, English MPs would decide the detail of laws affecting England, including income income tax and some welfare rates. They’d also get a veto over English laws, but MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland wouldn’t be excluded entirely. They’d still get to debate and vote on English laws. If you’re an MP elected, then you should get a say, but it seemed quite sensible to have a veto. Do the English MPs vote on Scottish laws? No, because obviously those issues have been devolved to the Holyrood Parliament. It doesn’t seem right then, does it? So it’s not enough? No. You’re going to have a bit of a hotchpotch. I’m not sure whether it will work fairly, but I can see what they’re trying to do. It’s supposed to be a United Kingdom, thisjust seems like a step in the other direction. Labour accused the Conservatives of playing fast and loose with the UK. The Lib Dems said it was a mistake. Ukip said it would lead to chaos, but some Tories said their party hadn’t gone far enough. The great danger of this proposal is, while we have some protection under English laws under this arrangement, it still in and wreck English legislation. The Conservatives hope that by curbing the powers of MPs from Scotland, they can win votes in England in an election that could see more SNP MPs elected to Westminster. So this is as political as it is constitutional. james Landale, BBC News, in Oxford. Our top story this evening.

Some of the country’s top child psychiatrists say they’re very concerned about an online craze for so called ""skinny selfies"" among teenagers. They’re warning that the sharing of pictures - mainly by girls - on social media websites is fuelling anorexia among young people and making the treatment of sufferers much more difficult. Our correspondent, Alex Forsyth, has more details. One girl’sjourney One girl’s journey through anorexia, a personal battle made public to highlight the danger of an online culture where image is king. These so-called skinny selfies often shared on social media are a trend that’s causing concern. This consultant child psychiatrist says a barrage of thin images can encourage those with eating disorders to compete. Patients might post images of themselves or of the food they’re eating and invite comment or judgment from others. So, for example, if they look at a post and find out someone else looks thinner than they are, that will spur them on to eat less, do more exercise. When young people become very ill they can be admitted to units like this to get intensive support. Here, their internet access is limited to try and protect them from that barrage of online material that can be so damaging. Abigail Davies knows too well the powerful pull of an unhealthy internet community. Diagnosed with an eating disorder at 13, and isolated in her illness, she turned to pro-anorexia sites online. When you’re already in that grip of anorexia,ed and that is your vice already, you turn to those websites and you turn to those to look at. There is no age restriction on these sites. You have 12, 13-year-olds who may not have been aware of eating disorders. They can click on the images. It might trigger something in Campaigners say the them. Internet can offer important support to sufferers but the dangers with those with eating disorders must be better understood. We are calling upon parents and friends and everyone else to understand the role that social media plays in young people’s lives and help them become resilient to the more toxic aspects of it. The girl in these images, once enticed by the world of skinny selfies, is now on the road to recovery. Alex Forsyth, BBC News. The widow of Alexander Litvinenko has been giving evidence at the inquiry into his death. She broke down in tears as she described the last days of his life. Our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, is at the Royal Courts ofjustice. Gordon. Marina Litvinenko and her 20-year-old son appeared today and talked about the Harrowing three weeks as they watched Alexander Litvinenko die. Marina wiped away tears as she talked about their last words and the way in which she collected his hair, which was falling out because of the radiation poisoning. The inquiry was also shown a video. A video used to illustrate perhaps the way in which some in Russia saw him. That video shows Russian special forces undergoing training. At one point, they start shooting at targets. One of the images on the target is a picture of Alexander Litvinenko. Now, the inquiry also heard about other threats against him. It heard that in Russia he was told that both he and his then six-year-old son might be killed. In London, he received another warning that he’d been singled out for what was called ""elimination.""

The new figures show that the performance of major A&E units in Scotland was better than the rest of UK. Scotland’s Accident and Emergency departments failed to meet targets on waiting times set by the Scottish Government in the last three months of 2014. The new figures show that the performance of major A&E units in Scotland was better than the rest of UK. Hugh Pym, reports from Dundee. It’s a heavy workload. The official Accident and Emergency target has been missed. But at some hospitals in Scotland there’s a calmer atmosphere, including here at Ninewells in Dundee. This special unit, dealing with non-emergency cases, mainly referred directly by GPs, helps take the pressure off A&E where more than 98% of patients are seen within four hours. The key things are having primary care, that’s GPs, pharmacists etc, engaged in seeing patients, having an efficient emergency department with senior doctors present and having an efficient hospital. It’s a big hospital in a major city and it’s a time of day when you’d expect Accident and Emergency to be busy. But here, right now, things are pretty calm. One reflection of how successful the hospital is at managing the flow of patients. That’s good news for Mark, who was sent to A&E by his GP after fainting the previous evening. I’ll be in and out of herw in an hour-and-a-half, pretty much. How do you feel about that? Excellent. The worst thing in the world is to be hanging about not knowing what’s happening. I’ve been kept informed the whole way along. At Scotland’s major Accident and Emergency units, 90% of patients were seen within four-hours over the three months to December. That was slightly ahead of the figure ofjust under 89% in comparable units in England. The figure for Wales was under 80% and the number for Northern Ireland just over 75%. But some, like Catherine, are far from happy. Her elderly mother had a very long wait before being admitted to the right ward in Glasgow. In the casualty itself, that was like 12/13-hours. Waiting all that time. It was absolutely horrendous. There were people on trolleys outside toilets. Rising patient numbers and record hospital admissions, Scotland’s health challenges reflect those across the UK. Hugh Pym, BBC News, Dundee.

Did something in our society is unspeakable. She kissed a black man. Take any list of best loved or most popular novels you will almost certainly find on it the story of the upright lawyer and the tale of racial injustice in the deep south. To Kill a Mockingbird sold more than 40 million copies and was turned into an Oscar-winning movie. After that, fans waited, and waited. Harper Lee retreated from public life, nothing more was published. Which is what makes today’s announcement so startling. Let mim go. The new novel, Go Set a Watchman features Scout, but as an adult. It was written in the 50s and was the inspiration for To Kill a Mockingbird. It was thought it had been lost forever. Harper Lee’s public appearances are rare. She never gives interviews. In a statement it says the book has been rediscovered by a friend and that a few people she trusts said it was worthy of being published. Given the impact of To Kill a Mockingbird, this is already a major literary event. A print run of around two million is planned. To understand, look at this. Fans have been waiting for more than 50 years. Harper Lee, its said, isjust humbled and amazed thatit its said, isjust humbled and amazed that it will finally be published. David Sillito, BBC News.

David Souaan posed with machine guns and tanks when he visited the war-torn country in 2013. The 20-year-old, who studied at Birkbeck College in central London, had told fellow students he wanted the black flag of Islamic State to fly over Downing Street. They were so shocked by his extreme views they reported him to the security forces. Katharine Carpenter reports.

Coming up later in the programme: Harry Redknapp resigns from QPR. We’ll have the latest from Loftus Road. Changes to planning rules could see London councils losing hundreds of millions of pounds which would have been used to create more affordable homes. A new government policy means big developers no longer have to pay a levy when rebuilding vacant properties without extending. Now a group of property companies which stands to gain from the change hasjoined councils in condemning the move. Victoria Hollins report. Victoria Hollins reports. Like many Londoners, this woman has struggled to get her own home. But she and her colleagues can now borrow the money for a rental deposit from their employer, under a new scheme the government hopes will be adopted by other companies. I want to move out. I have been staying with my parents. I really need money to pay my deposit and gets independence, and to help. She and her colleagues are part of a growing number of people who struggle to afford to live in London, and it is claimed there could be fewer affordable homes built because of a change in government policy which means developers of empty buildings are no longer obliged to pay for the construction of further affordable housing. Councils, including Islington, claimed the change could have devastating consequences. There has been an onslaught on affordable housing within the planning system. What the government have done now is a really big extra bloke, a threat to our ability to get affordable housing out of the planning system. It threatens the future of London. Westminster says a ball so lose out. The development of Chelsea barracks provided £78 million for affordable homes. The council says it could now lose similar future contributions, and that it has already lost £27 million this year and other developments. At this site in Grosvenor Square, where they are building luxury flats, developers had agreed to pay £18 million towards affordable housing. But last week, Westminster council found out that because of the changes, they are going to get £10 million less than they thought. That is just at one site. This developer represents some of London’s biggest property companies. They have written to the government, claiming the plans are deeply flawed. Developers want to contribute to the economy and to our community as much as anyone else. We want to make sure we pay what is fair. It is important developments feature a mix of all housing types as well as office properties. We don’t want to avoid paying where we should be. The key thing is getting empty properties back into use to create homes we need and that people want, and a stubborn being blocked out by overregulation, and putting in stealth taxes than make them unviable for developers to put them forward. Much of London is already very appealing to developers, and the fear is, unless they are forced to contribute to lower cost homes, there will simply be more properties that most people will never afford. A south London man has been banned from driving for three years and jailed for 14 months for driving the wrong way along the M25 for nine miles. CCTV footage shows 20-year-old Mitchell Locke driving erratically along the motorway, weaving across lanes and onto the hard shoulder, before he crashes with two cars near Bluewater shopping centre. The judge said it was an absolute miracle no one was killed. A senior Labour politician has told a judge looking into allegations Police are looking for a man who stole £1,000 from a blind widower at his home in Romford. The suspect, who arrived pretending to carry out repairs to the boiler, took the cash as well as jewellery belonging to the victim’s dead wife. Scotland Yard want to speak to this man in connection with the case. A senior Labour politician has told a judge looking into allegations of election fraud in Tower Hamlets that he was falsely branded a ""racist"". john Biggs, who lost the mayoral election in Tower Hamlets, was giving evidence on the second day of a hearing into accusations against Lutfur Rahman. Biggs said he had been referred to as ""john Bigot"" by Mr Rahman’s election agent in an attempt to influence the result. If A leading rowing coach from west London is missing- after it’s believed he fell into the Thames last night from a boat near Putney Embankment. Search teams have been scouring the river today. Alice Bhandhukravi is near the scene now with the latest. That’s right. It is a cold night here tonight, as it was last night, and it was around this time last night when the row in question went missing. It is believed he fell into the water here shortly after seven o’clock, and we believe the row in question is Mike Hill, a well-known and well-respected rowing coach, who trained with Latymer School nearby, with several local clubs. What are you hearing about what happened? It is thought he was setting off in his coaching boatjust after seven when he fell into the water, as I say. It was thought to be somewhere along Putney Embankment. Emergency services were called, and carried out an extensive search along the river, involving the Met Police, the Port of London Authority, the London Fire Brigade, and even a helicopter. The missing rower’s boat was found upturned and not be against some other vessels moored along Putney Embankment, but there has been no sightings so far of Mike Hill. London’s rowing community along this part of the river have produced a number of Olympic medallists, and there are several local clubs. I am told there is great sadness and worry for the fate of Mike Hill. The search here continues. Thank you very much indeed. Next: Continuing our series Crowded Capital and the challenges facing London because of its record - and still growing - population. Tonight, how will our schools cope with another 400,000 pupils? That’s the dilemma facing head teachers, politicians and planners over the next two decades. Our education reporter Marc Ashdown looks at the radical solutions being considered. OK, yearsix. Very OK, year six. Very good. Now, pay attention. This is very important. By the year 2039, when it comes to school places, London will have quite a problem. In our Crowded Capital, roughly 20% of the population is of school age. Right now, that is about 1.6 million children. By 2039, it could rise to about 2 million children. Potentially, an extra 400,000 places to create. Croydon is the borough facing the most acute immediate growth in pupil numbers. This school has recently doubled in size. It is not the only one growing. Every primary school in Croydon has been expanded in one way or another. We need a new secondary school every yearfor We need a new secondary school every year for ten years. yearfor ten years. Is that possible? It is going to be a real difficult thing to do will stop there isjust a real difficult thing to do will stop there is just very little land. The new building is on another site. As an academy, they can share facilities. Food For Thought for stand-alone schools. So is the flatpack design. After that, the house seems to spring up. Could we be heading for a prefab classroom revolution? Quick to build, flexible for the future. Another option is to go in the style of career. -- future. Another option is to go in the style of career. -- South Korea. Here, they double shifts cooling, with classes running late into the evening. They are top of the educational world tables. Or perhaps follow the Chinese model, with bigger class sizes. The average is 44 pupils to a class. Here, it is about 30. This is the last piece of glass in the whole school. The school and Barking is the country... Biggest primary. It has tripled the number of pupils compared to most. You have to be very creative with the use of space and timetabling. We had to use our library as a classroom. We put two classrooms in the car park, even. We have about three assemblies per day, and we need a shift system at lunch time. We feed over 1000 children, and about 150 staff. Such efficient use of space has got architect thinking as well. Expect schools of the future to have playgrounds on the roof, and more. We need flexible schools that are at the heart of the community, so we perhaps need GP surgeries, police, aduh perhaps need GP surgeries, police, adult learning, and other community facilities at the heart of the school. Sir, from extra large classes to flatpack schools, or shared multipurpose community Hubs, there are some radical possibilities for our schools of the future, to help try and solve the huge challenges ahead. And with me now is Laura Mclnerney, a former teacher and editor of Schools Week. Thank you for being here. I won’t pretend we will sort this out in a couple of minutes, but there were some radical solutions posed there. Flatpack schools, split shifts, extra large classes. What do you make of some of those solutions? There are two main problems. One is that they need land. Flatpack all mobile classrooms are great ideas, but you still need the land. Lots of schools in London don’t have outside space, or if they do, it is very limited. The other issue is that if it is something like a shift system, we have a system in the school I taught where we had lunch at different times. That is great, but when you are trying to teach your subject and explain to think very intricate and difficult, and outside, lots of children are running around, playing football, it can be quite distracting. And if you are starving on a Friday afternoon because you have a late lunch, and the smell of fish and chips comes in, it could be quite difficult. Doesn’t sound ideal, but when you have a pressing problem like this, even in the short term, we need a school places in the next few years. What with that sort of pressing demand, you may not have a choice. Absolutely, and in those cases, schools are doing the best they can. Lots of them are putting up temporary classrooms, something we saw several decades back when we had a very similar situation. It can be done well. Technology has moved on. You can now have several stories of those, and if that must be done, it must be done. We have to get these children some places. Isn’t the elephant in the room the shortage of teachers, and retaining them in a city that is expensive to live in? London is actually doing a lot better on that. About ten years ago, that was absolutely true. There are many reasons why it is a great place to teach, and it has brought lots of teachers in. There is potentially an opportunity here, which is that if we have lots of children and more hours and limited buildings, we could make it more flexible, so you can have more flexible hours, and that might appeal to some teachers who at the moment, perhaps don’t get evenings or weekends that they want. You could be more flexible as to when you have children in schools. Thank you for your views. I hope some teachers get in touch on our Facebook page with their views. And after schools, our Crowded Capital series looks at how our transport system can expand to meet demand. Another of the challenges is how the capital will transport millions of extra passengers. Tomorrow, Iwill be looking at the plans being put in place to make sure this system can cope. To find out more about the capital’s population, past, present and future, just go to our website, where we’ve plenty of London facts and figures. And you canjoin the conversation on social media using the hashtag #crowdedcapital. Stay with us. Still to come: The London duo who have used the sounds of historic moments to inspire their next album. The Chief Executive of the UK’s National Hospital for Spinal Surgery has warned it’s on the brink of closure, because it’s being forced to treat patients in what he describes as ""third world"" conditions. Rob Hurd of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore says his staff are providing top quality care in buildings that aren’t fit for purpose. Sarah Harris reports. It may be world class when it comes to the treatment of complex orthopaedic problems, but the buildings at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore are anything but. This man has undergone a 17 hour back operation, and is recovering on a ward that was made as a makeshift shelter for troops in the Second World War. He says having to travel down a steep slope by trolley was not an experience he would want to repeat. It is just the unevenness of the flaws, the slope is legendary. It is like a ski slope rather than a corridor. It isjust like a ski slope rather than a corridor. It is just a corridor. It isjust a miracle how they get things up and down here. This was a temporary measure during World War II to take the troops back from the battlefields. Hospital managers say they have waited four years to study building programme on the 120 acre site, but they are afraid the green light may come too late. We are concerned about, in the long-term, this place with the building is dying, the ability to service patients’ needs will diminish overtime, and I ability to service patients’ needs will diminish over time, and I will mean the break-up of a national centre of excellence. The trust says £80 million was earmarked by the government for building on this site about the time of the last election. But they say they have spent that amount of money and more in a year since then, just keeping these buildings here safe. The Department of Health said this matter was in the hands of the Trust Development Agency. It says the right solution must be affordable and offer value for money, and that a business case will be assessed once it is received. Meanwhile, hospital staff say their patients deserve a building to match the care they are receiving, to preserve an NHS success story. Harry Redknapp, the Queens Park Rangers manager, has resigned. The club isjust one place off the bottom of the Premier League. He’s cited urgent knee surgery as the reason for his departure, but there’s speculation about the timing of his decision. We can get more from our sports reporter Chris Slegg at Loftus Road. Yes, the timing does see a bit strange. Harry Redknapp has been under pressure, like most Premier League managers, ever since he took charge in 2012, but he seemed to have ridden out the storm twice, the first time being when he and the club were relegated in 2013. He kept his job then. club were relegated in 2013. He kept hisjob then. QPR his job then. QPR were firm favourites to come straight back up as champions, but they limped back towards promotion, through the play-offs, and many thought Redknapp might leave of his own accord last summer. He stayed on until this morning. At 530 this morning, he phoned Tony Fernandez, the chairman, to tender his resignation. They have had a really difficult season. Second from bottom of the premiership, and they have lost all 11 of their away games. He told the chairman this morning he needed to leave to have this operation on his knee. He said he did not give 100% any more, but that may only be half of the story. Yesterday, on transfer deadline day, he was only allowed to sign one player. There were two significant messages from Tony Fernandez on Twitter. One said, no more cheque-books. The other side, with the right motivation tactic in coaching, we can achieve more. It is hard not to read that as a criticism of Redknapp. But on leaving today, Redknapp did say that his relationship with Fernandez was fantastic, and Fernandez himself issued this short statement. He said: I would like to take this opportunity to thank Harry for everything he has done for QPR. So, the two of them certainly saying their working relationship was strong. And of course, the focus will inevitably shift to who is going to take over. Yes, and it could be quite a swift appointment. At the moment, Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey at Emperor really in charge. They are on the coaching staff here already, and last season, they were on the staff of Tim Sherwood at Tottenham. He was sacked in summer, and is firm favourite to take over here. It is thought QPR could even appoint him before their next match against Southampton on Saturday. Chris, from Loftus Road, thank you. It’s not unusual for musicians to be inspired by historic moments. But one south London band has taken the idea a little bit further, thanks to a unique deal they’ve struck with the British Film Institute. The duo, called Public Service Broadcasting, believe they’re doing more thanjust putting history to music, as our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus has been finding out. The first flight by men into the cosmos, on April 12, The first flight by men into the cosmos, on April12, 1961. It was a moment in history that impressed the world, and has gone on to inspire a couple of corduroy wearing musicians, who have used astronaut Uri Geller Karin’sjourney to outer space to produce this. Public Service Broadcasting have built a cult following. They combine their electronic sound with sampled footage from the British Film Institute archive. I heard a Radio 4 documentary about the BFI releasing some 1940s and 1950s stuff online, and I had kind of mucked around with samples before from various sources, and thought it was good fun, so was very much a bedroom operation. I took if you samples from it, didn’t ask permission at the time, and then got in touch with them later to see if they were interested in working together. They said yes. The relationship with the BFI, and their impressive archive, has become one of mutual benefit. It is a fantastically creative and unusual use of archive, and it is reaching a worldwide audience. Probably also an audience that would not normally seek out archive footage or come across it in other areas of their life, so it is fantastic from our point of view. The new album is inspired by the Golden Age of space exploration, but World War II, the conquest of Everest, and road safety archive have all received their special treatment. But the band and see themselves as delivering more than funky history lessons. It is more interesting, I think, the way that we are bringing stuff from the past and putting it in a present setting. That is what we buy kind of doing that makes it interesting. If we were just making period doing that makes it interesting. If we werejust making period music around it, Ithink we werejust making period music around it, I think it would not have the appeal that it does. They have supported the Manic Street Preachers and the Rolling Stones, and have the humble aspiration of selling as Brixton Academy. As they make their way through history, prepare for samples of FA Cup finals and royal weddings. I quite like that! After flurries of snow this morning, let’s get the forecast with Alina jenkins. Thank you to everyone who posted photos to our Facebook page. Here are if you. -- a feud. On that note, we better get the forecast. What can we expect after that? If you or snow showers in the next two days, but I think eyes will be more of a problem, where snow has started to melt and bridges fall to freezing. There could well be slippery surfaces. There could also be one or two snow showers pushing down, a view develop a across East Anglia and heading towards us, but more of a flurry. Tonight, there will be clear spells coming and going through the clouds. So although you could see a flurry of snow, I think ice is going to be the problem, temperatures getting down to freezing on untreated surfaces, and that could be slippery. A really cold and the night. We are still in the cold air tomorrow, coming in from this northerly wind. Further showers starting to click north-eastern coast, and some will try and get down towards us, but not get very far. Tomorrow morning, some spells of sunshine, one or two wintry showers, but the sunshine will generally win. In the afternoon, highest chance of showers. There will be wintry showers, some sleek, some snow, and maybe a bit of rain. Certainly another cold day, highs of three or four Celsius. Tomorrow night, still these cold conditions. A mixture of clear spells and cloud. One to showers may give some slightly cumulus and of snow, but not amounting to very much. Again, ice will be the problem on Thursday morning. Slippery surfaces where they are untreated. Any showers should tend to die away on Thursday as this high pressure starts to dominate, but look what happens towards the end of the week. The isobars squeeze themselves together, and some really cold air comes from the continent. At the end of the week, it will be bitterly cold, but for the next 24 to 48 hours, there will be showers, but the snow will not amount to much. On Friday, some pleasant spells of sunshine, tempered by strong wind. Bitter conditions to end the week. Back to you. Thank you very much.

The answer may surprise you. I have been stealing diamonds the 30 years, until they locked me up. Was this really worth two months salary. The look on my mole’s face told me it was but not every man had her to come home to. I used to think that I had stated the most brilliant sting but the biggest diamond heist of all was happening right in front of me. How did they do it? Well, the idea that people had to buy a diamond engagement ring is not an ancient tradition. It is the work of an advertising agency, hired by the DeBeers diamond company. In 1947, it came up with the immortal tag line, a diamond is forever. The slogan worked. And this man will explain why. I think because there is a truth at the heart of the idea is last forever. You overlay it with the romantic notion of eternal love. -- the romantic notion of eternal love. -- it lasts forever. That is a powerful winning combination. Who came up with the idea that you had to spend two months salary on a diamond? What is really clever is thatitis diamond? What is really clever is that it is not a number. My salary could be £1000 per month, sol that it is not a number. My salary could be £1000 per month, so I spent £2000, or £20,000 per month sol spent £40,000 which is an incredible double mechanism to get people to buying to how much they should be spending but underlying it with guilt being leveraged in order to sell diamonds. The idea was to get the man in there on his own to sell to him, make him feel like you need to spend that amount of money, that he was not doing justice to his future bride if he did not buy a diamond big enough for her. The success of the campaign was evident. On the evil the Second World War, 10% of engagement rings contain diamonds. By the end of the 20th century, 80% did. -- diamonds. By the end of the 20th century, 80% did. -- on the eve of the Second World War. This one is going to break your heart but then your heart we broken. So sorry, not interested. Five or six. Thousand? Seriously? Why would you spend so much money? I love her so much. If you getting gauged, would you expect a diamond ring. Yes. How much would you expect them to spend? Isn’t it three months salary? I know some people say you are sas -- three months salary? I know some people say you are sas -- supposed to spend a month salary. Some girls I met say three months minimum otherwise you’re not getting married. That is a girl’s point of view. Diamonds are forever, the phrase was conjured up for DeBeers. It was and it perfectly explains the diamond because they were formed about 3 billion years ago by mother nature and she has made no more so they are forever. What do you say to people who think it is an advertising scam? I think that is patronising the people you love diamonds. Foran patronising the people you love diamonds. For an engagement ring, you should spend two months salary? We gave the guideline but as far as we are concerned, it is not how big or how much you spend on the diamond but how much you love. They were good but I had my own plan, with a slight twist. True love is as red as a Ruby. Iam a Ruby. I am sensing a lot of blokes chewing deficits. A lot of pressure. How much do you want the proposal to be a surprise and how much should it be a joint decision on the cost and the style of the ring? I think it depends on how long you have known each other. In my case, we had known each other for a while, and we just wanted to get on with it. I actually had my choice of engagement ring. That is quite different. I was asked which one I liked. I like the 1 you could see. LAUGHTER My wife said, ""that is the one"". She did not let me pick it. I’m not even allowed to do the shopping. I could come back with the wrong brand of breakfast cereal. That is generally the case these days, Gyles? People make joint decisions but a lot of the people we serve eight, the girls want the boys going down on one knee, producing a ring which has cost a lot of money and taken some care. People are doing new things now as well as a diamond engagement ring which is a modern concept. People are getting even more modern and introducing rings which are tattoos. Shouldn’t that be at the wedding stage? People are doing it. You may think a diamond is forever but curiously, on your ring finger, a cartoon is not forever because it does not take very well, the epidermis does not like it. So it washes off after a while. It is interesting, the two of you, sitting there in pain, bleeding from your hand. You have to sit together with your hands together for this. The heart comes together as you put your hands together, which is rather charming. It is romantic if it is the right way round! Otherwise it looks like your bottom! ""I love you from the bottom of my heart"". Some research has shown that if you spend between £1250 -2500, you are more ",,

He’d been taken captive in December when his plane came down in Syria as he took part in American-led operations against IS. Angry scenes injordan as news came through of the pilot’s murder and the King called for national unity in the face of IS brutality.

We’ll be asking how this latest atrocity could affect jordan’s approach to tackling IS. Also tonight - the fight against genetic disease - families welcome a proposed new law to allow the creation of babies from the DNA of three people. It’s mind boggling for us and other families who are affected by mitochondrial disease. It’s the best news.

And, half a century after her triumph with To Kill a Later on BBC London - jailed on terror charges, the student with extremist views who wanted to fight in Syria. And, why thousands of much needed affordable homes won’t get built, because of changes to the planning rules. Good evening. jordan has threatened a strong, earth-shaking and decisive response to the murder of one of its pilots by Islamic State extremists. A video released by IS is said to show Muath al-Kasasbeh being burned to death inside a metal cage. The pilot was captured in December when his plane came down in Syria as he took part in the American-led operations against IS. Our world affairs correspondent, Paul Adams, is in the jordanian capital, Amman, tonight. 27-year-old Muath al- Kasasbeh, 27-year-old Muath al-Kasasbeh, a fighter pilot and devote Muslim. Missing since his plane crashed in Syria six weeks ago and now the first member of the US-led coalition to die at the hands of Islamic State. Everyone injordan has heard the news. They hoped against hope he would be set free and venting their anger against the men who murdered him and some want to know why are we in this fight at all. His father was among supporters when he heard the news. He and other family members have left the capital to murn at home. -- have left the capital to murn at home. -- mourn at home. The picture in the region will be changed. It means that the fight against IS all terrorists will be stronger, firm and more effective. jordan’s military says the pilot’s blood will not be shed in vain and it’s promising a befitting punishment. The king is striking a more sombre note. TRANSLATION: They are a criminal group. It has no connection with our great religion. The brave pilot died defending his beliefs, homeland and nation. Hejoins all the martyrs who made the ultimate sacrifice for dearjordan. The mood here in Amman tonight is furious. Many of the people have seen the video over and over looping on television and they know exactly what has been done to a member of the Royaljordanian Air Force and already they’re talking about revenge. TRANSLATION: I believe all Arab countries and the international community have to take a strong stand against this group. Because it has become an epidemic against all societies. And if this woman, who they say should die first, a failed suicide bomber injail here for the past ten years. Last week, jordan offered to release her in exchange for Muath al-Kasasbeh. But Islamic State had other ideas, offering to release the japanese journalist, Kenji Goto instead, but they killed him last weekend. The pilot may already have been dead for weeks. Whatever ideology they’re operating off of it’s bankrupt. We’re here to talk about how to make people healthier and their lives better. I guess this organisation appears only interested in death and destruction. jeremy Bowen is with me, our Middle East editor. You’ve seen the video? I have. We are not showing it because it’s absolutely depraved and awful. Certainly in my 30 years or so as a foreign correspondent I’ve seen very few things worse than that. Islamic State relies on shock and horror and disgust to intimidate enemies and also to rally its own people and perhaps they decided that decapitation wasn’t having the effect that they wanted it to have any more, but certainly, as you’ve seen from the pictures from jordan, it’s causing a great deal of anger and the king will want people to rally behind him. They clearly want to destabilise the international coalition against them. Will this have the desired effect or not? I don’t think so. I think what’s likely to happen is increase the resolve of those people who don’t like Islamic State or who oppose it and it may well delight their fighters, who knows. I think the nature of the killing and the way it’s been so graphically and professionally filmed, as well, it amplifies the horror of what’s happened and there’s been on social media as well, a lot of outcry from Muslims saying it’s not part of their religion, but in a sense it’s not new. We haven’t really learnt a great deal new about Islamic State and what they’re going to do, so while the bombing will go on, so far, the efforts to get together a ground force to fight Islamic State on the ground are not yet credible in terms of what they could do. Will this be a turning point? Probably not I suspect. Certainly, the point is that IS fighters continue to kill without mercy and containing them at the moment is hard enough and defeating them at the moment is not a possibility the way things stand. America, briefly, tonight underlining its backing forjordan? King Abdullah and President Obama are due to meet and they arranged an appointment in about 30 minutes in the White House. Thank you. The United Kingdom is set to become the first country in the world to introduce legislation allowing the creation of human embryos from the DNA of three people. The legislation was strongly promoted by scientists who say it will stop children inheriting certain life-threatening diseases. There’s intense debate about the technique which critics say could lead ultimately to genetically altered babies. Our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, reports. A landmark day for medical science and for couples like Victoria and Keith from Buckinghamshire, who hope to be among the first to benefit from a historic change in the law. Their daughter, jessica, has a devastating inherited condition. She’s brain damaged, can’t swallow so needs to be tube-fed. jessica is not expected to live beyond a few years. I just don’t believe that we should bring another child into the world that could suffer the way thatjessica has. I’m 38 and I’ll be 39 injune, so this really is our only option, final option, in terms of having a child that we know is absolutely free of the disease. Motion number six on human fertilisation and embryology. MPs were given a free vote on what is a matter of conscience, and they backed the change by a three-to-one majority. This is a bold step for Parliament to take, but it is a considered and informed step. This is world-leading science within a highly respected regulatory regime and for the many families affected, this is light at the end of a very dark tunnel. That is exactly the point I was about to make... But in an impassioned debate, some argued it would be a dangerous and irreversible step. Once the genie is out of the bottle, once these procedures that we are being asked to authorise today go ahead, there will be no going back for society. So how would this pioneering IVF treatment work? From a newly-created embryo, the nucleus from an affected couple would be removed, this would leave behind the Ao mitochondria of the mother. These provide energy to cells, and when damaged they can pass on devastating diseases to a child, causing muscle wasting, brain damage, heart failure or blindness. The parents’ nucleus, which contains all the key genes which shape appearance and character traits, would be transferred to a second woman’s donor embryo containing only its healthy mitochondria. Crucially, the tiny amount of DNA from the donor would be passed down the generations, a permanent change to that family’s genetic heritage. The scientist who will be the first to apply for a licence to treat couples says there will be strict safeguards. I don’t think this is a slippery slope. I think this is an important advancement in medicine to allow women to have healthy children. And forjessica’s parents - delight. It isjust mind-boggling what this could mean for our family and for other families who are affected by mitochondrial disease. It’sjust the best news. That’s good, and then under your arms. This is a hugely significant moment, notjust for this family, but for science and society, allowing the DNA from three people to create a child. A genetic change that will pass down the generations. Fergus Walsh, BBC News. The widow of Alexander Litvinenko, the spy who died of radioactive poisoning in London in 2006, has told a public inquiry about a series of threats made against the family before they fled to the United Kingdom. Marina Litvinenko also spoke of an arson attack on their home after they’d moved to London. Two Russian agents, suspected of poisoning Mr Litvinenko, deny any involvement and are still living in Russia, as our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, reports. Russian special forces going through training exercises. A video played today in the inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, why? Because of this. An image of the former Russian spy apparently used for target practice. In the eyes of some in Moscow, he’d become a traitor after this press conference, in which he spoke out about corruption in the security service, in which he worked. After this, he was, it was said today, allegedly told, notjust that he would be killed, but also his then six-year-old son. That son, Anatoly, arrived at court this morning, seen here on the right, with his mother Marina. He said he was left numb by his father’s death. My name is Alexander Litvinenko, I’m a former KGB... He watched as this video was also shown in which Alexander Litvinenko spoke outjust before his murder. Even after he fled to Britain, it was alleged he’d received warnings. The inquiry heard that Alexander Litvinenko had received an email from a former colleague. It said that he’d been singled out for what was called ""elimination"" and said he needed to make sure he’d written his will. His wife and son spoke of the harrowing days as the former Russian spy’s condition slowly deteriorated after he drank a cup of tea laced with radioactive polonium. Marina Litvinenko described collecting the hair falling out of his head in a plastic bag. She wiped away tears as she recalled his final words, saying he loved her. Laid to rest in a London grave, Alexander Litvinenko’s son, Anatoly, said his father was always proud to have become a British citizen. Gordon Corera, BBC News. The Conservatives have unveiled their proposals on who should be allowed to vote on English legislation at Westminster. A future Conservative government would give English MPs a decisive say in the words of William Hague over laws affecting them. But all MPs from every part of the UK would have a final vote. The proposals have been attacked by some Conservatives for failing to ban Scottish MPs from voting on exclusively English issues, as our deputy political editor, james Landale, reports. What concerns me is that the Scottish MPs have a say in my country, and I don’t have a say in theirs. It doesn’t really concern me, itjust seems illogical. English people should be voting on the things that only affect the English. After promising Scotland more powers during the independence referendum, David Cameron also promised to listen to the voices of England. Today, his First Minister explained what that meant. The Prime Minister and I have decided that the option we will put forward to Parliament and the country will be one that gives an effective veto to English MPs over matters only affecting England, or England and Wales, while maintaining the integrity of the United Kingdom Parliament. Under the plans, English MPs would decide the detail of laws affecting England, including income income tax and some welfare rates. They’d also get a veto over English laws, but MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland wouldn’t be excluded entirely. They’d still get to debate and vote on English laws. If you’re an MP elected, then you should get a say, but it seemed quite sensible to have a veto. Do the English MPs vote on Scottish laws? No, because obviously those issues have been devolved to the Holyrood Parliament. It doesn’t seem right then, does it? So it’s not enough? No. You’re going to have a bit of a hotchpotch and I’m not sure whether it will work fairly, but I can see what they’re trying to do. It’s supposed to be a United Kingdom. Thisjust seems like a step in the other direction. Labour won’t say what it would do about English votes until after the election, but accused the Tories of playing fast and loose with the UK, but some Tories said their party hadn’t gone far enough. The great danger of this proposal is, while we have some protection over English laws under this arrangement, it still gives the opportunity for the SNP, in certain circumstances, to come in and wreck English legislation. The Conservatives hope that by curbing the powers of MPs from Scotland, they can win votes in England in an election that could see more SNP MPs elected to Westminster. So this is as political as it is constitutional. james Landale, BBC News, in Oxford. The name of the person chosen to chair the long-awaited inquiry into historical child abuse is expected within the next few days. The debate on protecting children is likely to focus as much on prevention as it is on punishing offenders. Opinion is deeply divided on how and when authorities should intervene to stop potential perpetrators. In the second of his special reports, Fergal Keane BSSESSES Remote corner the current arguments among the child protection experts. Across Britain what was so long hidden is at last coming into the open. I was four and three quarter years old. One day a man came up to me, offered me money to go into the woods with him, then he reaped me. It makes you feel violated. him, then he reaped me. It makes you feelviolated. It feel violated. It makes you feel dirty. Ijust feel worthless all the time. People who die of serious causes, I preferto time. People who die of serious causes, I prefer to give them my life.

We have been speaking with abusers and those working with them. I feel, I feel really and those working with them. I feel, Ifeel really guilty, yes. It’s... It’s unacceptable what I did. Eddie, not his real name, served nine years in prison for child rape. Nothing entered my head much I didn’t have any respect for anybody. It was something at the time I wanted to do. I must have wanted to do. Now I can’t understand why, but... I didn’t respect... I didn’t think about the parents. I didn’t even think about the children. Since leaving prison, he has been helped by a volunteer circle from his own town. If circle hadn’t been there things possibly would have gone... Started right over again. So, things possibly would have gone... Started right overagain. So, it’s been good. It’s been good for me and, hopefully, it’s good for a lot of other people as well.

Circles UK helps paedophiles referred by the Probation Service to reintegrate into society. Crucially, challenges theirthoughts into society. Crucially, challenges their thoughts and behaviour when necessary. They often feel lonely and isolated from the community. And, by helping them, by challenging them, their behaviour, their attitude and their risky thoughts, if they indicate risky behaviour, we can prevent them re-offending. Public opposition to the idea of paedophiles living in the same community is high. That is cyber stalker. Is a parents group was formed in Cumbria which uses social media to name and shame convicted paedophiles in their community. Police say such activity can drive paedophiles under ground. I think it’s really important that children are protected from predatory paedophiles. An innocent trusting children’s life is more important to be kept sacred and safe than a paedophile. I think that paedophiles do need to be named and shamed and people do need to be aware of where paedophiles are look living locally so we can keep our children away. In the Netherlands there is now public advertising urging paedophiles to get help before they offend. I’ve come to this city to meet a leading figure in attempts to stop paedophiles offending and to help them reintegrate into the community. jules doctors a government backed project providing a helpline and one-to-one therapy. He says they are having growing success in prevent abuse. These people are in society, they are amongst us, it’s better for them and us if wejust they are amongst us, it’s better for them and us if we just accept this fact. We can help them to live a normal life. We make society safer if we just acknowledge the problem. Working together, politicians and si -- psychologists believe significant numbers of men can be prevented from acting out if the the intervention is close enough. While punishment and rehabilitation is essential, prevention must become a bigger part of the battle. Fergal Kean ge. BBC News. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories. Scotland’s Accident and Emergency departments failed to meet waiting times targets set by the Scottish Government in the last three months of 2014. The new figures show that the performance of major A&E units in Scotland was better than the rest of UK.

Professor Robert Langer has won the £1 million award for his development of drug-release systems, tissue building and microchip implants. The latest surge in violence in eastern Ukraine is ""catastrophic"", according to the United Nations. The number of civilian casualties has risen sharply, and more than 200 have died in the past three weeks alone, as pro-Russian rebels have launched a new offensive. The UN say more than 5,500 people have been killed since the fighting began in April as our correspondent, Bridget Kendall, reports. Close up, on the front-line in eastern Ukraine. Government troops holding their position with heavy artillery. A dangerous escalation, with indiscriminate firing from both sides, says the United Nations. From the pro-Russian rebels, the barrage of grad missiles is just as fierce. And trapped in the middle, terrified locals, many of them trying to get out. 2,000 have fled in the last two-days alone from this area, from the very young, to the very old. Some barely able to get through the mud. Many buildings are half destroyed by the shelling. Electricity and water cut off. But even so, some are refusing to leave. TRANSLATION: My mother has been paralysed for four years, and there’s no way of getting her out. So I’m staying behind. There was a ceasefire in September to try to stop this war, but it never really took hold. Since january, it’s flared up again, with the number of deaths rising dramatically as the fighting has spread. First, the pro-Russian rebels seized the airport at Donetsk in a fierce battle which reduced it to rubble. Then further south, the port of Mariupol came under intense shelling and now a battle is underway for a key railway hub called Debaltseve, with local civilians caught in the cross fire. The pro-Russian rebels are so heavily armed both Kiev and western governments are convinced that Russia must be fuelling the war. Though the Kremlin denies it. So some in the West now argue that it’s time to give Ukraine proper military aid. If we are simply going to be frightened of doing anything to stop the spector of the Third World war then Ukraine will be torn apart. Of course it is risky. It’s a very difficult decision. It has to be handled carefully. Nobody is talking about invasion. Nobody is talking about sending in NATO or American troops. Even so, for civilians more arms would be more hell and for the West a gamble. In case this conflict, in a remote corner of Ukraine, became a full-blown war between the West and Russia.

Harper Lee, the author of one of the most successful novels of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird, is publishing a second book - after a gap of more than half a century. Her new work will be released this summer, but it was written back in the 1950s and the manuscript was lost until it was rediscovered last autumn. As our arts correspondent, David Sillito, reports the new work will deal with some familiar themes, the tensions and racial prejudices of a small town in Alabama. She did something that in our society is unspeakable. She kissed a black man. Take any list of best loved or most popular novels and you will almost certainly find on it the story of the upright lawyer, Atticus Finch, his daughter Scout, and this tale of racial injustice in the Deep South. Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize, sold more than Ao million copies and was turned into an oscar-winning movie. After that, fans waited, and waited. Harper Lee retreated from public life. Nothing more was published. And then, without warning, 50 years on, a new novel, Go Set A Watchman. In it we are told we encounter Scout once again, but this time as an adult. It was written in the ‘50s and was what led her agent to suggest writing a novel about Scout as a girl. Harper Lee’s public appearances are rare. She never gives interviews, she’s elderly, infirm, and there have also been legal wrangles. This rediscovery of a lost novel, by her lawyer, is an unexpected turn of events. Certainly, there are several people who are raising the question about how it is exactly that this novel was suddenly, this draft, was suddenly found and could be brought out so quickly? The cynically minded may wonder whether there’s more going on than meets the eye. The reaction to To Kill a Mockingbird was, its said, something she never wanted to go through again. An 88-year-old has sprung a major literary surprise. The first print run, two million. And, this is why. An army of fans have been waiting for more than 50 years. Harper Lee is said to be just humbled and amazed. David Sillito, BBC News. Newsnight is on BBC Two. Here isa Here is a quick preview. 3,000 people a week are dying in Britain.

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The fighting and killing have continued in east Ukraine, despite the peace deal signed yesterday and a cease-fire due to come into force tomorrow night. It’s being reported seven civilians and 11 soldiers have died in the last 24 hours. And today, Ukraine’s Petro Poroshenko returned to Kiev sounding pessimistic about the long term chances of peace. ""Nobody"", he said, ""has a strong belief that the deal signed in Minsk will be implemented strictly"". We’ll be getting the latest from Ukraine in a moment, but first here’s our World Affairs correspondent, Nick Childs. Another disturbed and disturbing night, it seems, in the rebel held city of Luhansk. This is unverified footage, but both sides are reporting more fighting and casualties in this dangerous interlude before the cease-fire. Observers fear it could be undermined before it even begins. We really expect these hostilities to terminate at the deadline that was set in Minsk. We would really hope to see a decrease already between now and that moment. The anguished aftermath of last night’s shelling in Luhansk. The separatists say more civilians have died. This is cries to the Ukrainian president, ""where is your cease-fire? Have you decided to raise the rebel region to the ground before it takes effect?"" But there are accusations in the other direction, too. A siege of government forces around the strategic town of Debaltseve has been a key flash point in the recent fighting. What happens here will be a crucial test. But the Ukrainian army says it has suffered more casualties in further intense clashes, and the rebels continue to build up their forces. Under the new road map agreement for Ukraine, the initial steps up challenging enough, given past experience. The cease-fire at midnight local time on Saturday, the release of prisoners within five days of that, the withdrawal of heavy weapons within two weeks. But there are even more questions over the longer term elements of the deal. Constitutional reform and reaching agreement on the status of the breakaway rebel territories. Ukraine is meant to regain control of its border with Russia but only by the end of the year. And how will Moscow interpret the agreement to withdraw all foreign forces? Surveying more recent wreckage in rebel held Donetsk. The mounting cost of this conflict for all and the involvement of the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany in the latest peace deal may make a difference this time. But the doubts still surely outweigh the glimmer of hope. Well, our corresponent james Reynolds has the very latest now from Donetsk in east Ukraine. The cease-fire has yet to begin. Hearing Donetsk, we have continued to hear the sounds of war. -- Hearing Donetsk, we have continued to hear the sounds of war. -- here in Donetsk. The sounds of explosions in the distance of artillery fire. We have also seen footage posted online from the rebel held city of Luhansk, which shows heavy fighting at night. The Ukrainian army has said that in the last 24 hours, it had lost a number of its own service men. In other words, had lost a number of its own service men. In otherwords, in the run-up to this cease-fire, this plan cease-fire, the conflict continues. We know that all sides are now looking at the practicalities and the details of implementing the agreement, including withdrawing heavy armour from both sides to create a buffer zone and then looking very closely at the demarcation line. The Ukraine president, Petro Poroshenko has said that his military commanders will meet Russian military commanders to go through details and begin looking at implementation. The cease-fire is due to start at the end of Saturday. But few in Donetsk and perhaps view on the other side in government held territory in expect a complete or sudden end to war. Let’s speak to our correspondent, David Stern, who’s in Kiev. David, is there any confidence where you are that the cease-fire, if implement tomorrow, hold? There is more hope than confidence. There is a hope that this is a deal which could see some form of success, and perhaps that it is favourable to Ukraine and the Kiev government. But at the same time, there is a great deal of scepticism, starting from the very top, as you said, the president, Petro Poroshenko has injected a note of realism or perhaps pessimism about the success, saying he has no illusions and he is not a naive man, saying he has no illusions and he is nota naive man, and he saying he has no illusions and he is not a naive man, and he knows it is not going to be fulfilled strictly. But there is a hope at least that the cease-fire will be introduced, and it will last, and it will lead to other elements of the peace deal. But of course, as we have heard, there are many elements to it. The last peace deal, which was reached in September, was not implemented at all. At the least, people are hoping that the blood-letting and the bloodshed will end and there will at least be a bit of room and some breathing space to introduce the other aspects of the peace deal. Thank you forjoining us. The former TV weatherman, Fred Talbot has been found guilty of indecently assaulting two young boys when he worked as a teacher in the 1970s and ‘80s. But he was cleared of charges against three other boys. Talbot found fame as the weatherman on ITV’s This Morning show. Let’s cross to our correspondent, judith Moritz, who’s in Manchester. Yes, and you may know him from his floating weather map but it is Fred Talbot’s previous career as a teacher, Ao years ago, which has caught up with him today. He was charged with ten offences in total, and the jury here acquitted him of most of the charges. But they have found him guilty of indecently assaulting two teenage boys in the mid-19 70s. And the former weatherman showed no reaction inside the dock of courtroom number nine, as he was taken to the cells. Right, over the North of Scotland, a lot of cloud. Fred the weatherman made his name jumping around on the map in Liverpool for ITV’s This Morning programme. But light-hearted meteorology was not Fred Talbot’s first career. He trained as a teacher in the late 1960s and spent 15 years working in the North of England. For much of that time, he taught at Altrincham Grammar School for boys. It gave him the perfect opportunity to be with the children on school trips and even at his own home. Fred Talbot taught biology and astronomy here from 1974. He says he was a really good teacher with an informal style. But he resigned after a decade, later saying publicly it was so he could start his media career. Infact, it was because he had propositioned two teenage boys. Talbot wrote about what happened in his diary. A group of fourth-year boys had visited his house to use his telescope. He invited them to stay the night but reveals, ""as usual, I had quite a bit to drink and as usual, I tried. I must be mad"". The court heard the boys had resisted their teacher’s advances and told their parents. But Talbot did have sexual contact with other teenage schoolboys, taking them on outings, letting them drink alcohol and indecently assaulting them. The page I have gone to, I havejust opened randomly, is April, 1969. After his arrest, the police questioned him about his diary. Is that your handwriting? No comment. At first, Talbot would not confirm it was hisjournal. But then he did let it slip. Oh, God, my writing is dreadful. Black something, in two cars. So that is your writing? No comment. Talbot denied being obsessed with teenage boys saying that the claims have been made up but the jury did not believe him. Asa As a teacher, he had a responsible at Edu the boy at his care but he has abused it and used them in an appalling way. Talbot’s diary shows that he was aware that his behaviour was wrong. In 1985, he wrote, ""not a bad night but I must watch how often I am seen with kids"". Fred Talbot had much greater career success as a weatherman than as a teacher, but now there will be calls for him not to reappear on screen. for these crimes on the 13th of March. Meanwhile, in Scotland, but RogerAiken March. Meanwhile, in Scotland, but Roger Aiken fiscal is examining a file which has been passed there, containing allegations of similar offences said to have been committed by Fred Talbot on Scottish soil. -- the Procurator Fiscal. It’s estimated 1 million women in the UK take hormone replacement therapy. But a new study suggests HRT may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The research by the University of Oxford found that there was one extra cancer case for every 1,000 women who received HRT for five years. Here’s our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh. 1 million women in the UK take HRT to treat symptoms of the menopause. The increased risk of breast cancer is well established. And now this analysis of more than 50 studies shows a definite link with ovarian cancer. A woman’s lifetime risk of getting ovarian cancer is one in 50. The study found there was one extra case of ovarian cancer for every 1,000 women who took HRT for five years from about the age of 50. Professor Richard Peter, the co-author, said that of the 7,000 cases of ovarian cancer each year, HRT probably triggered a couple of hundred of them. It is not a zero risk. It is probably a couple of hundred women a year in this country and a couple of thousand worldwide. They are getting ovarian cancer because they have used hormone therapy for the menopause. We now know this. The study found that even short-term use, well below five years, raised the ovarian cancer risk. But this tailed off after HRT stopped. Charities say women should not act rationally. They need to talk to their GP and make sure they know the symptoms, which is biting, abdominal pain, feeling full and needing to go to the toilet more often. They have to discuss their family history of breast and ovarian cancer with their GP. In the UK, women take HRT mostly for between two and five years and this analysis will add to evidence suggesting short rather than long-term use is preferable. And Fergus is with me. There is going to be concern out there. How worried should women be? They should be aware but not alarmed. This is about making an informed choice. We have heard about the risks of HRT but for women who suffer severe symptoms of the menopause, what flushes, night sweats, they can be very severe. -- hot flushes. HRT for many of them is life changing. It does notjust improve their well-being, it reduces the risk of osteoporosis and for some women, improve their libido. Really, what happened about a decade ago was that there was a massive study which showed an increased risk of breast cancer, a few cases per 1000 women taking it over five years and prescribing rates fell off a cliff. They more than halved. Still I million women are taking it. On its own, this will not be enough, I don’t think, to change prescribing habits but it will allow women to make an informed choice that they need to talk to their doctor if they have concerns. Thank you forjoining us. Waiting times at A&E units in England improved slightly last week. just under 93% of patients were seen within four hours, but this is still below the target of 95%. NHS England said the figures were moving in the right direction. Compared with other parts of Europe, the UK has a bit of a reputation for binge drinking. Well maybe that’s about to change. New figures suggest the number of people who drink heavily has fallen, and that one in five people no longer drink at all. And the change appears to be most dramatic in Scotland, where far fewer people are dying from alcohol related problems. Here’s our Scotland correspondent james Cook. Binge drinking is still a big problem in Britain but it does seem to be improving at last. More than a fifth of adults are now teetotal, according to the latest statistics. Those who still turn to the bottle are drinking less. It appears to be part of a long-term trend. Drinking habits don’t change overnight. They take a long time to change. Our data shows that the trend is an increase of people who are not drinking and a decrease in binge printing. It is a positive message. A drop in drinking should mean falling crime and reducing hospital, too. Today’s figures suggest it is young adults who are driving the change, drinking less frequently. In 2005, 17% of 16 to 2lI-year-olds drank on five or more days of the week and by 2013, it had fallen to 2% and they are drinking less heavily. Binge drinking was down from 29% in 2005, to 18% in 2013. Four in ten young adults who drank in the week before interview still binge. However, the fact that group is driving the degreasing binge drinking overall is a very positive message that we may well be making a difference. -- decrease in binge printing. The Department of Health and white or describes the changing attitude as replacing, saying it hopes young people are developing healthy habits for life. Here in Scotland, politicians update La Liga raised that alcohol deaths have fallen sharply over the past decade. -- that alcohol deaths have fallen sharply over the past decade. -- are particularly pleased. If we are enjoying alcohol more responsibly, what is the reason? There are various theories, the economic downturn making it less affordable, improve treatment programmes, better education. Whatever it is, Britain mayjust be tiring of its love affair with booze.

Coming up, on the eve of England’s first match in the Cricket World Cup, MichaelVaughan first match in the Cricket World Cup, Michael Vaughan defends the record of the captain after Geoffrey Boycott claimed he is not as good as he thinks he is. It’s 70 years since hundreds of British and American bombers devastated the German city of Dresden and it remains one of the most controversial episodes of the Allied air war against Nazi Germany. As many as 25,000 people died in firestorms that virtually destroyed the medieval city and ever since, there have been questions about whether Dresden was a legitimate military target. Some believe the bombing was actually a war crime. Later today, memorial services will be held in the city centre. jenny Hill is there. In the words of once five, it was like being in hell. Standing in this square, it is hard to imagine 70 years ago it was engulfed in flames as Dresden was all but razed to the ground -- as Dresden was all but razed to the ground -- in the words of a survivor. Here they still refer to it as the day which never fades. 70 years ago, Allied bombers took off. The target, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Beneath them, people burnt and suffocated to death. The firestorm with hurricane force winds raged through Dresden. Ursula was a girl of 14. She tells me they clung to a lamp post. One woman did not make it. She was sucked into the burning ruins. My coat was burning, everything, coat, dress, underwear. I had a burn as big as a saucer on my back. When daylight came, this is all that was left. The images, the story still shock visitors today. Of course, Dresden was not the only city to come under attack. Warsaw, Belgrade, Coventry, they were all bombed too. But 70 years later, this remains a powerful symbol, notjust of war, but of reconciliation too. Dresden is now home to half a million people. They commemorate the firebombing every year. Dresden is just a little part of the Second World War and the Second World War consists of many thousands of little parts. It isjust consists of many thousands of little parts. It is just an example of warfare and of course it made sense because Dresden was part of the enemy and you have to hit the enemy to end the Second World War. Hard now to imagine Ursula nearly dying in this square. She still has nightmares but the city is rebuilt. For her, its stones or a reminder. No more war, she says, never again. Perhaps some of those taking part in the commemorations today will glance to the top of the church behind me, Frauenkirche, that cross at the top was made by an Englishman whose father took part in the bombing of Dresden and presented to the newly rebuilt Frauenkirche as a symbol of friendship, reconciliation and rebirth. jenny hill live in Dresden. Thanks, jenny. The value of shares in Greek companies has gone up amid optimism that Athens will be able to renegotiate repayments to its creditors. The new Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, says a mutually acceptable deal is possible, while Chancellor Angela Merkel believes Germany is ready to compromise. Meanwhile, new economic figures for the Eurozone show overall growth, but Greece’s economy has shrunk again. Let’s speak to our correspondent in Athens, Mark Lowen. A deal may be in the offing for Greece and all eyes will be on the Eurozone finance ministers’ meeting on Monday. How are people feeling there? There is a mixture of relief and some trepidation. Relief because there is rather less chance of a head-on collision at the meeting on Monday. The mood music was quite good out of the summit last night. Some trepidation because Greeks see the government is already beginning to change the ideas they were talking about before the election. Compare what was being said a few weeks ago to what is being said now. Before Alexis Tsipras was saying the bailout would be consigned to history, the end of the bailout. Now he says he would keep 70% of the old bailout and try to renegotiate the rest to end austerity. Before he was saying Greece would never again talk to the technocrats of the so-called troika, the European Commission, the IMF and ECB. Today the talks are going ahead albeit with a different name and in Brussels not here. Before there was intense anti-Angela Merkel rhetoric. Now there are all smiles meetings between the two leaders. Greeks like standing up to Brussels and Berlin but they fear Greece’s place in the euro and that is driving this because time is ticking. If there is no agreement by the end of February when the bailout programme expires, this country will be running out of money. The banks and markets could be hit and Greece’s place in the Euro could be threatened and it could send shock waves from Athens right across the world. Virgin Media says it’s making its high-speed internet services available to an extra four million homes, at a cost of £3 billion and creating 6,000 jobs. It’s part of Virgin’s battle with BT, Sky and TalkTalk for a slice of the huge market in providing pay TV, fixed-line telephones and broadband in a single package. Here’s Rory Cellan-jones. ~ Ican I can destroy my enemy in high-definition. The broadband race is hotting up. Virgin is planning to take rivals like BT and Sky with an expansion of its network and its boss certainly is not underplaying the significance of the investment. This is significant as the building of the railways in the 19th century or the motorway network in the 20th. Top speed broadband is essential to economic development and to people’s lives. Virgin media is going to be building a network in a whole host of areas that today we cannot serve. Virgin says 6000 new jobs will be needed as it lays its fast broadband cables in places like Glasgow. 4 million more homes will be offered the service as the company fills in gaps in its network in streets that were never hooked up when cable first came to the UK. Even in the heart of London’s Soho, you cannot get a Virgin Media broadband connection right now. It cost too much to get permission to dig up the street. That is going to change. One thing isn’t. Large areas of rural Britain will not benefit from this announcement. In this area of Lancashire, they got tired of waiting for a decent broadband connection and built their own network. Campaigners say the Virgin Media announcement does nothing for them. This is another announcement that will not touch the room at areas. People have woken up to the fact that the BT led government sponsored broadband roll-out is not coming their way. Now they have seen another major announcement that will not help them. There will be an awful lot of anger in rural communities. BT welcomed Virgin Media’s announcement while noting its own network was bigger and still growing. Two big broadband players are competing hard for your custom. If that is you live in the town not the country. Millions of us routinely upload photos and other personal information onto the internet, believing it will stay safe and be easily accessible. But Vint Cerf, one of the pioneers of the internet, is warning of an impending digital dark age. That’s because pictures, video and documents could be lost forever, as technological advances make current computer software and hardware obsolete. Here’s our science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh. Our life, our memories, our most cherished family photographs increasingly exist as bits of information on our hard drives or in the cloud. But as technology moves on, they risk being lost in the wake of an accelerating digital revolution. For centuries, our lives have been recorded on paper, a storage medium that has lasted through the ages. This papyrus sketch is more than 2,500 years old and you can still see all of the information on it. By contrast, these floppy disks were once at the cutting edge of technology, but now they are obsolete. Any information on them is extremely hard to extract and probably lost forever. The Computer History Museum in Mountain View in the heart of Silicon Valley records how computer technology has raced forward. Yes, it was state-of-the-art, but that was many, many years ago. The staff here are concerned we risk risk losing something important as innovation leaves old systems behind. I cannot even read my e-mail from ten years ago, let alone think about what my grandchildren might think of things. So this is where the digital dark age phrase comes in because things are so impermanent compared to what they used to be. One idea is to preserve every piece of software and hardware so that it never becomes obsolete, just as they do at the museum, but in digital form, in servers in the cloud. It has been put forward by Vint Cerf, one of the men who developed the internet. The solution is to take a digital x-ray, snapshot, of the content and application and the operating system, together with a description of the machine that it runs on, and preserve that for long periods of time. That digital snapshot will let us recreate the past in the future. If his idea works out, the memories we hold so dear could be accessible for generations to come. Pallab Ghosh, BBC News, Sanjose. They’re man’s best friend and new research suggests dogs may be able to read our facial expressions. A study in Austria found they could tell the difference between sad and happy faces, with the help of a little reward, as our science reporter Victoria Gill explains. Ask any dog owner whether their pet can sense their mood from the look on their face and you are likely to get the same answer. Absolutely. He stares at me with his big brown eyes and reads my expression. 100%. No doubt about it. She is great with my kids as well. If they are upset, she gets distressed and she will whine and try and come and find me to let me know. She definitely knows when I’m grumpy. I think he is pretty good at recognising facial movements, expressions as well. A lot of empathy. Maybe that is all in my head, but that is what I like to think. In a touch-screen experiment at this lab in Austria, scientists put canines to the test. They showed dogs pictures of the eye or mouth area of human faces that had either happy or angry expressions. Half the dogs got a treat for nosing an angry face, the other half were rewarded for touching happy faces. Then came the test. When the dogs were shown happy or angry-faced pictures of people they had not seen before, they were still able to tell the difference and earn their treat. The scientists say their experiment proves dogs can discriminate between the two expressions. They think the animals use their experience of how humans express themselves to make that distinction. It is the first really strong evidence, empirical evidence, that nonhuman animals can differentiate between facial expressions or emotional expressions of another species. It is still not clear though that our pets understand what our emotional expressions mean, but there was one intriguing clue from the study. Before they were taught the rules of the touch-screen test, dogs had a natural aversion to pressing their noses against pictures of angry faces. That could mean our canine friends have an inkling about the meaning behind a very human look, something that many dog lovers will agree with. Victoria Gill, BBC News. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today: The fighting is continuing in eastern Ukraine despite the approaching ceasefire between rebel and pro-government forces. In a moment, we’ll have a full national weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first, with news of a bleak assessment of England’s chances in the Cricket World Cup and all the rest of the day’s sport, here’s Hugh Woozencroft at the BBC Sports Centre. On the eve of England’s first match in the Cricket World Cup, former captain Michael Vaughan says ""pigs will fly"" if they win the tournament. England start against co-hosts Australia in Melbourne tomorrow. Vaughan still believes in the talents of captain Eoin Morgan. Afterjust two runs in his last four innings, Geoffrey Boycott branded him ""overrated"". You know Geoffrey Boycott is going to give strong opinions. A lot of times I agree with him but this time, you’ve got it wrong. Looking at Eoin Morgan’s numbers in one-day cricket, he averages nearly 37, seven centuries and a strike rate of 135. We say Australia have the best bowling attack and only he and AB de Villiers, who I think is the best player in the world, have an average of over 40 against Australia. In our six or seven years, a husband one player in one-day internationals that when England have played well against the better teams, it has been down to Eoin Morgan. Co-hosts New Zealand open the World Cup tonight in Christchurch against Sri Lanka. Six weeks of cricket is the aim for the 14 teams involved, one of them competing for the first time. There is flush the geography at the start of this report. -- There is flush the geography at the start of this report. -- flash photography. Here’s our sports correspondent, joe Wilson. The Afghanistan players send themselves off with pride. For South Africa, they want to get to the final this time. And for England, please get out of the group. The Australians had nojourney or improvements to make, apparently. The co-hosts are clear favourites according to most observers. You have to deal with it. We know what is going on with the group and we are comfortable with where we are sitting after a good last 12 months, winning 19 of the last 23 games. We are in a good space. We arejust worried about playing good cricket. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. New Zealand are a home side and also in excellent form, too. We are encouraging the group to enjoy the tournament and the fact that it is going to captivate New Zealand and Australia in the next six weeks. Don’t be afraid of that. At the last World Cup, India’s semifinal with Pakistan was one of the world’s most sought-after sporting occasions. They played another again on Sunday. No one in Pakistan needs reminding of that. You could not blame them for believing that Pakistan can be victorious this time. India are defending champions but seem to have forgotten how to win. Undercooked is cricketing talk about it repaired. I know cooked and overcooked, there’s a fine line between, and especially if you come you can understand that. But again, asl if you come you can understand that. But again, as I said, when we played the champions Trophy, we were in a similar situation like this. And the guys stepped up and that is what I feel is important in tournaments. Afghanistan have no experience of this tournament but they know about the power of cricket better than anyone. Totally, because if you saw the news, everywhere there is fighting in the news but if there is positive news like cricket, Afghanistan in the World Cup, it has totally changed minds back home and also in the world as well. That is certainly a fine sentiment to end with for the tournament begins. -- before the tournament begins. Scotland have made two changes to their starting line-up for Sunday’s Six Nations match with Wales. Sean Lamont returns after a calf injury to make his 92nd Scotland 8ppâ8Iâ8I’ICâ.

Tottenham striker Harry Kane is set for his first England call-up, with coach Roy Hodgson all but confirming he’d be in his upcoming squad. Kane has scored 23 goals in 35 games this season and Hodgson says he’s ""everything you look for in a centre forward"". Next month, England play Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier and Italy in a friendly. That’s all the sport for now. Back to you, Clive. The latest Clint Eastwood blockbuster, American Sniper is tipped to be one of this year’s big winners at the Oscars. It’s based on the real-life story of Chris Kyle, who served four tours of duty in Iraq and earned the reputation as the most lethal sniper in US military history. But two years ago he was shot dead, and the trial of the man accused of killing him is now dominating the news in America. Victoria Fritz reports. She is carrying something. It is already the highest grossing war film in history. Yet the real-life ending of the story of America’s most lethal cyber is only now unfolding. Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield were gunned down here at a Texas shooting range two years ago. The trial of the manic used of killing Chris Kyle and his friend is underway. If found guilty, Eddie Royal, a former Marine, could face the rest of his life behind bars. -- face the rest of his life behind bars. -- Eddie Routh. He stole Kyle’s truck after the shootings. Here is the moment he surrendered to police after a high-speed chase. Kyle had been helping other veterans deal with combat related stress and mental health issues. Eddie Routh was one of those he helped. Locals described Kyle as a hero. It is so sad. A guy that tries to do what is right and good and was probablyjust trying to help this young man, befriend him. Since a husband’s death, she has become well-known for her work with veterans. She gave a testimony this week. Eddie Routh’s lawyer is pleading insanity. Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty. The outcome of this trial could come as Hollywood revealed this year ‘s Oscar winners. American audiences want to know how the true story of Chris Kyle plays out. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Helen Willetts. Another cloudy day again today, as it has been all week. But the differences that we have low-pressure sat across the country. With that cloud, we have got some rain and fairly strong winds as well. Let’s look at the cloud. It is quite lumpy in nature which means there is some heavy rain and thereafter some breaks following behind which means it will turn showery later. Fora behind which means it will turn showery later. For a short time, some fairly intense rain and then the showers that follow will be pretty heavy as well. As I say, the wind is quite lively with gales around the Irish Sea and English Channel coasts. Not particularly special for the commute back this evening. In many areas, spray and standing water, whether from the rain or the showers, with hail and potential funder following. Some hill fog potential funder following. Some hill fog as well with the weather system and the tops of the Pennines and the Cumbrian fells and Southern uplands could see a smattering of snow. Still hanging around in parts of Northern Ireland. The North of Scotland is again seeing the best of the sunshine today. As it has done in recent days. Overnight, it is most likely to see the frost under clear skies. Elsewhere, low-pressure clear skies. Elsewhere, low- pressure meandering clear skies. Elsewhere, low-pressure meandering with a lot of cloud underneath it, keeping us frost free. The showers start to diminish but we will have a not very inspiring start to Saturday with lots of cloud and grisly showers around. Because it is to our re-, hopefully that may lift the cloud a bit and we may see is brighter spells but the best will be in the north and west. A little milder than it has been and for many of us, a lot of dry weather to be found eventually tomorrow with the odd shower. One of those could affect Twickenham for the rugby at it should be dry for Ireland against France. Tomorrow evening and overnight, showers will diminish further. We are more likely to see a few breaks in the cloud and therefore a bit of patchy fog and frost. The winds will have fallen. Out west, the next weather front is looming. But at the moment, and it has been giving us a headache for the last few days, how quickly it will come eastwards. At the moment, it will look like -- will come eastwards. At the moment, it will look like -- it looks like it is mostly coming towards Northern Ireland and Scotland towards tea-time. Despite chilly start, temperatures recovering for the rest of the day and it should be dry and hopefully dry for Scotland against Wales at Murrayfield as well. It is more likely that the rain will come about through Sunday evening and overnight. As it does, it could be quite a significant band of rain, like today, falling as snow in the hills and the North. Cold enough behind it with north-westerly winds, with wintry showers following. Some rather unpleasant conditions in this evening’s rush-hour. BFE. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Sonja jessup. The Mayor’s announced a deal to bring a branch of one of the world’s best-known museums to the Olympic Park, as he nears the end of his six-day visit to America. It would be the first time Washington’s Smithsonian has OpâI’Iâd B ITIUSEUITI OVEFSEBS. Borisjohnson’s trip has seen him visit New York, Boston and Washington, from where our political correspondent Karl Mercer sent this report. The message from the mayor’s office is that it’s time to get the hell out of Dodge. It has been one week in three cities, plenty of visits and plenty of dressing impress. My shirt hanging out will not... What is wrong with me? just quibbling about my personal appearance. Reaching the end of his US tour, the mayor was visiting the Smithsonian Museum in Washington which is promising to open a new branch in London’s Olympic Park. To get an institution like the Smithsonian, a world-class museum, one of the greatest on Earth, to send stuff to East London would be an amazing success for that part of the city. We’ve never had anything like it before. And of course the Victoria & Albert Museum and other things as well. But that won’t be until at least 2021, so what of the other event of the week? Borisjohnson speaking at roughly this level, God, it’s cold! The mayor in Boston promised to look at plans to tunnel roads under some parts of London. It is not going to happen while he is at City Hall. In New York, he was intrigued by radiation detectors worn by police, promising to talk to Scotland Yard about it. But London’s force does not have the tens of millions spent by Bill Bratton’s force in New York. Mr Mayor! How are you? Welcome to New York, although I know it is your birthplace. It was a successful meeting with former US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. It will help boost the mayor’s profile on the global stage. It is for a good cause. The benefits of this trip for London may take a little longer. Meanwhile, Borisjohnson’s used a speech in Washington to call on the Chancellor to devolve more financial powers to cities. It comes as the leaders of nine east London councils meet to discuss the possibility of devolving more powers from the mayor to their boroughs. They say they want to unlock economic potential and improve life for residents by taking more responsibility for housing and employment. The father of a man stabbed to death in a road rage attack by Kenneth Noye has reacted furiously to news that he may be freed from jail. Noye was jailed for life in 2000 for killing Stephen Cameron on the M25. He’d already served time over the Brinks Mat robbery, in which millions of pounds worth of gold bullion were stolen at Heathrow. Noye has been given a parole hearing but Stephen’s father, Ken says he believes his son’s killer should die injail.

Figures suggest a downward trend to drinking habits led by the young. We know that it can affect you. Whereas I don’t think people had the knowledge back then. We’ll be asking what has caused this continuing fall in how much we drink. The millionaire businessman who didn’t pay tax for over two decades. How the Inland Revenue failed to prosecute. The TV weatherman Fred Talbot is found guilty of indecent assault against two underage boys when he was a teacher in the 1970s. The German city of Dresden remembers the victims of the Allied bombings of 1945. And why Barack obama’s been fooling around in the White House. Coming up on BBC News, as England prepare for their opening game of the cricket World Cup players passed and present come out in support of under fire and present come out in support of underfire captain, Eoin and present come out in support of under fire captain, Eoin Morgan. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. New figures suggest the UK could be about to throw off its reputation for binge-drinking. The Office for National Statistics says the numbers of people drinking heavily is falling among younger age groups and that overall one in five people don’t drink alcohol at all. In Scotland, although binge-drinking remains among the highest, fewer people are dying from alcohol-related problems. james Cook is in Glasgow. Yes, thank you very much indeed. For years now Britain and Scotland in particular has had a difficult relationship with booze and a dangerous one at that. Of course, many people enjoy a drink, but it causes pain and misery and costs millions for the police, the courts and hospitals as well. Over the past decade, there has been an effort to do something about that and there are signs now that it maybe paying off. In a classroom in Glasgow, these students were learning about the demon drink and everyone it seems has heard a horror story. I know of someone, they drank too much and ended up falling in a bucket of water and nearly died. Stories like that are becoming less common. Younger people seem to be drinking less or not touching booze at all. And this class agree that something has changed. Well, the effects of alcohol and it has made a difference. You don’t need alcohol to socialise with your friends and have a good night. Because we know the health risks and we know it can affect you. Whereas, I don’t think people had the knowledge back then. They didn’t think it would affect them. Young people binge-drinking at least once a week is now down from 29% in 2005 to 18% in 2013, but there is no change for A5 to 6lI-year-olds and an increase among the oldest in society. So what’s going on? This GP still sees patients with alcohol problems every working hour, but he says, simple measures are saving lives. Doctors are encouraged and paid even to ask people about their alcohol intake and to discuss the alcohol intake and the dangers of it and encourage ways of reducing... Does that make a difference? I think it makes a difference. I have had people thank me for it and come back and say they have changed their behaviour as a result. There are big differences in consumption around the country. You are most likely to be tee total if you live in London where nearly a third of adults say they don’t drink. In people in the south-west are most likely to drink on five days every week and drinkers in the north-east and in Scotland hit the bottle the hardest with 36 bingeing heavily at least once a week. Deaths from alcohol has fallen in Scotland in the past decade, but it maybe that some older drinkers are not changing their habitats. I don’t really go out that much because I have got a young daughter. I don’t really, I’m not, again when I go out, I don’t excess. When I go out, I think, I go out, I don’t excess. When I go out, Ithink, you know what, enjoy yourself. You deserve it. Doctors worry that boozing will pick up again when the economy improves, but there are signs that Britain may at last be tiring of its love affair with alcohol. With me now is our Home Editor, Mark Easton. What’s led to the change in drinking? It is extraordinary that the binge-drinking yob was media shorthand for British youth, but it has become unrepresentative with every year that passes. Young people in Britain are more likely to be tee total than their parents. Infact, they are more likely to be tee total than their grandparents of the it is notjust than their grandparents of the it is not just alcohol, they take fewer illegal drugs and smoke less. There is something going on here. It is partly lifestyle. More young people are more likely to be in their bedroom gaming or on Facebook or doing their homework than going out to the pubment that’s part of it, the other is diversity. If you look at places in Britain which have the lowest drink problems, they are the areas with the highest immigration. So for instance, in London, a third of people are tee total. Down in the West Country, it is 15%. I do of people are tee total. Down in the West Country, it is 15%. Ido think that perhaps actually what we’re seeing is diversity, a side-effect of that is changing our drinking habitats. -- habits. New documents obtained by the BBC show that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs failed to prosecute a wealthy businessman who hadn’t paid a single penny in tax for over two decades. Property investor Paul Bloomfield’s fortune was estimated at £60 million in 2006. But the documents reveal that he didn’t file a tax return for 24 years. HMRC wouldn’t comment on his specific case, but said it considered many factors when deciding what action to take. Richard Bilton reports. Private jets, helicopters, and luxury Private jets, helicopters, and luxury homes. Paul Bloomfield lived a lavish lifestyle, but for 20 years, he didn’t pay a penny in tax. It was projects like the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium that made Paul Bloomfield his money. In 2006, his fortune was estimated at £60 million. I have never seen anyone spending money as if there is no tomorrow and he has so many organisations, accountants, lawyers, to organisations, accountants, lawyers, to work for him and hide the money for him. Despite his lavish lifestyle, he didn’t pay the taxman a penny for 24 years from 1987 to 2011. In 2011 Mr Bloomfield was summoned to a HMRC office in London. The BBC has seen a transcript of that meeting between Mr Bloomfield and the tax inspectors and it makes more extraordinary reading. He said he had no income. He told tax inspectors the homes, the private plane had all been paid for by other people. Mr Bloomfield wanted the taxman to believe he have a pauper living a millionaire’s lifestyle, but the minutes showed he lived in a succession of properties in the swankiest bits of London. The taxman said he owed tax for the past 20 years, but didn’t prosecute. The BBC has seen documents that show they missed a straightforward opportunity to prove Mr Bloomfield’s dishonesty. He told the taxman he never had an account in an off-shore bank. The files leaked to Panorama show he had a HSBC account in Switzerland. HMRC had the files, they should have known it was a lie. We showed the documents to a former tax inspector. Based on what the revenue say about their approach to prosecution, that they prosecute the most serious cases, where there have been lies and where there is a serious amount of tax involved as there is here, a huge amount and it is over a period of time, which it is here, at least 20 years, then this would be the case that you would expect HMRC to prosecute. We think Mr Bloomfield is living in Spain despite many attempts to reach hill, he didn’t respond to our questions. We don’t know whether Mr Bloomfield paid any tax. HMRC told us they don’t comment on individual cases. Beyond confirming that the multi-millionaire who didn’t pay a penny in tax in 24 years was never prosecuted. The former TV weatherman Fred Talbot has been convicted of historical sex offences. Ajury found him guilty of assaulting two teenage boys while he was a teacher at a grammar school in the 1970s. He is expected to be sentenced next month. judith Moritz is at Manchester Crown Court. Yes, Fred Talbot’s crimes happened 40 years ago. He thought he got away with them even reinventing himself on television, but today, his past caught up with him. And the police say he continues not to show any remorse. Fred the weatherman was known for his fun floating forecasts. Millions watched, but amongst them, were his victims, distressed to see their abuser finding fame on national television. Fred Talbot had a sexual interest in teenage boys and as a teacher in Cheshire in the 1970s and 1980s he had ready access to them. He knew it was wrong, noting in his diary, I must watch how often I’m seen with kids. It is April 1969. He kept trying to hide his past, even once arrested and presented with the evidence in hisjournal. evidence in his journal. Is evidence in hisjournal. Is that your handwriting there? No comment. He denied the diary was his, but then let this slip. Oh god, mY his, but then let this slip. Oh god, my writing is dreadful. Black something in two cars. So that is your writing? That is your writing? No comment. Fred Talbot taught biology and astronomy here from 1974. He says he was a really good teacher with an informal style the he resigned after a decade, later saying it was so he could start his media career. In fact, it was because he propositioned two teenage boys. Fred Talbot took his pupils on canal boat trips. They would drink alcohol and he indecent assaulted two of them there. At trial, Fred Talbot denied being obsessed with teenage boys saying the claims were made up, but the jury didn’t believe him. As a teacher, he had responsibility to nurture and safeguard those under his care. A responsibility he has proven to have no regard for and abused in an appalling way. Fred Talbot’s TV career is now over. Tonight, he is in prison and he could face further prosecution too. The Scottish authorities are examining allegations that he offended there as well. The driver of a heavy goods vehicle that crashed in Bath, killing a child and three adults, has been named as 19-year-old Philip Potter. Philip Potter had been transporting rubble on Monday when he lost control of the lorry, hitting vehicles and pedestrians. Police refused to say whether they would be questioning the teenager now he is out of hospital. The Daily Mirror has publicly apologised for phone hacking. A statement in the paper says its behaviour was both unlawful and unacceptable and it was making an unreserved apology to the victims. The owner, Trinity Mirror, which also publishes the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, is setting aside £12 million for claims for damages. Hormone Replacement Therapy or HRT is known to increase the risk of breast cancer. Now, researchers at Oxford University say it also increases a woman’s chances of getting ovarian cancer, although by small amount. Fergus Walsh reports. One million women in the UK take HRT to ease symptoms of the menopause. They do so knowing it carries risks as well as benefits. This woman says HRT transformed her life giving her the energy to start a business in her 60s so she won’t be coming off it. When I took HRT it was a completely different thing. I became myself again. Totally normal. No night sweats and no hot flushes and I wasn’t exhausted anymorement I could cope with life easily. HRT is backin could cope with life easily. HRT is back in the news. Some women contacting the jeremy Vine Show said the risks were too great. He told me it could in the long-term cause cancer. So Ijust binned the lot and I’ve struggled through. What does this major new study in The Lancet tell us? Well, a woman’s lifetime ricks of getting owe variedan cancer is one in 50. There will be one extra case of owe variedan cancer for every thousand women who take HRT for five years. And one extra death per 1700 users. If you compare that to smoking, the biggest cause of preventible death, smoking kills one in two of all regular users. The report co-author said the findings added to halfs already known about HRT and cancer. Women who use hormone therapy for the menopause get an increased risk of breast cancer, perhaps a few per thousand. That’s been known for a long time and women should be told that when they are deciding whether to take the treatment. What is added to that is this new definite evidence about cancer of the ovary in addition to that, but smaller than that is this one in thousand risk of getting cancer of the ovary. The number of HRT users has halved in a decade. Ultimately, it is a personal choice for women as to whether the treatment is right for them.

The company says its five-year plan is the single biggest investment in digital infrastructure in the UK for more than ten years. But what will it mean for people in ruralareas? Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-jones reports. This is virgin media’s superfast fibre-optic broadband. Britain’s broadband rate’s race is hotting up. Virgin’s boss is not underplaying this moment. This is significant, as the building of the railways in the 19th century or the motorway network in the 20th. Top speed broadband is essential to economic development and to people’s lives. In Glasgow today they were already laying the cables that will bring superfast broadband to streets were virgin has not offered a service until now. For the most part the expansion of the network will be in urban areas, hooking up streets left out when cable TV first came to Britain. Even in the heart of London’s so how you cannot get a virgin broadband connection right now. For one thing it does -- connection right now. For one thing it does -- it costs too much to dig UP it does -- it costs too much to dig up the streets. That is going to change. One thing is not, large areas of rural Britain will not benefit from this announcement. This village is not far from Leicester, but is still very much in the broadband slow lane. Virgin will not becoming here any time soon, and local businesses say they are at a real disadvantage. I can understand why the large broadband providers like virgin media prioritise their spending, but it is leading to a situation where rural communities are being left out, there is a large chunk of ice as well, so there is a danger of like, a Toon agent-- nation state. BT says it has got a much vigour network than virgin media. -- BT says it has got a much vigour network than virgin media. -- bigger network. But the broadband gap between town and country may be about to get even wider. Waiting times for A&E patients in England are still being missed despite a slight improvement in the past week, according to the latest figures. 95% of patients are supposed to be seen within a target time of four hours. Last week 92.9% of patients were seen within that time - a small increase on the week before. NHS England says it’s encouraged by the rise. To try and ease the pressure on A&E departments this winter some hospitals are coming up with their own solutions, as our health correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. It’s been a tough winter in A&E departments across the UK. More patients have come through the door, many of them elderly and very ill. But delays in discharging them home mean pressure has built up So how to ease the demands on A&E? Here’s one idea - treat more people at home, freeing up hospital beds. Denise Vernon is undergoing a course of powerful antibiotics. Normally that would mean a two-week stay in hospital, but now, twice a day, she’s visited at her home in Manchester. For me it’s a win-win, because I get very dedicated treatment for two For me it’s win-win, because I get very dedicated treatment for two hours of the day, but I have all the benefits of being able to relax. What about those patients who arrive at A&E but could just as easily be seen by a GP? At North Manchester General, family doctors now work alongside emergency specialists to filter out less urgent cases. So all GPs working here actually work in a local practice, so essentially it’s our patients who we are treating in secondary care. So we understand them, we understand their needs. And in Newcastle’s Royal Victoria infirmary, improved coordination of care is helping older patients like Christine Laidlaw who is ready to go home. You’re desperate to get out once you feel a bit better, and they start to help you and you get your physio and all different things. Helping people get home as soon as possible isn’t just about freeing up beds and easing the pressure on busy A&E departments, it’s also good for patients and particularly old people, who stand a much better chance of making a good recovery. good for patients and particularly older people, who stand a much better chance of making a good recovery. So here, a team of medical staff and social workers is coordinating community care, to make sure there are no delays in discharging older patients from hospital. We proactively roam the hospital, trying to find older people ready-ish for discharge or in the early stages of planning, to make sure they safely get to a discharge long before several weeks in hospital have taken place. These solutions save money, are better for patients and help A&Es. The challenge will be to spread them across a health service that is still struggling with winter pressures. Now, it’s the President of the United States as you’ve never seen him before - goofing about in front of a mirror, trying to look sharp in a pair of shades, even enjoying a spot of air basketball.

About a million and hour since its release. I think that speaks right to me, I think it is funny. I think it gets the conversation started. Others think it is unpresidential.

But it should be a largely dry start of the day for Wales and the south-west of England. Some sunny spells here, cloudier skies through central and eastern parts of England, and it is here we will continue to see some showers. Some low cloud across parts of North Wales, northern England as well, and for Scotland we will see some dry unfairly bright weather with some sunshine coming through especially in the North. Generally a lot of cloud during the day, central and eastern parts of England will continue to have a few showers, but they are easing throughout the day. Best of any sunny spells further west. Saturday night into Sunday we have got quite a lot of cloud, but that will be some clear spells allowing some mist and fog patches. And perhapsjust a allowing some mist and fog patches. And perhaps just a touch of frost. For Sunday we are looking at another predominantly dry day, mist and fog lingering in one or two places. Western areas again having the best of the brightness. Towards the North West and will be turning wet and windy. But some spells of sunshine and temperatures around about seven to 9 degrees. A reminder of our main story.

Also tonight: Failing hygiene standards - how London boroughs have some of the worst food outlets in the UK. ~ Iam I am overwhelmed by the fact everyone has turned out today for this. I cannot thank them enough. The UK’s longest serving officer says goodbye after nearly 50 years of protecting Londoners. They mixed punk with politics - but will the Clash ever reform? We hear from guitarist Mickjones. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. One of the UK’s most notorious criminals is to be given a parole hearing. Kenneth Noye wasjailed for life 15 years ago for the murder of Stephen Cameron in a road rage attack on the M25. The 21-year-old was stabbed with a 9-inch knife. His parents have today reacted to the news that he could be given parole saying Noye never showed any remorse after the killing and should stay in prison until the day he dies. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake reports. We’ve got We ‘ve got lovely you don’t realise how happy you were until he is taken away. It may be nearly 20 years since their son was murdered but for the Camerons, the pain is still deep. It is a terrible thing to lose your child and I wouldn’t wish it on anybody. It was a spring morning back in 1986 when Kenneth Noye attacked Stephen on the M25 slip road in Kent. The killer could now technically be free within weeks. It will stay with us until the day he dies. Kenneth Noye is now 67, but he embarked on a life of crime when he was a young man. Back in 1983, he became a suspect in the £26 million Brink’s Mat robbery at Heathrow Airport. Two years later, when officers were watching his Kent mansion, Noye stabbed to death undercover policeman john Fordham. He was cleared of murder after pleading self-defence - but sent to prison for handling stolen gold. By 1996, Noye had been freed and stabbed to death Stephen Cameron on the M25. He fled to Spain before being extradited a few years later. In 2000, he was found guilty of Stephen’s murder, given a life sentence, and told he’d serve a minimum of 16 years. Now that term’s nearly up, Noye can apply for a parole hearing, but whether or not he is actually released is a completely different matter. It would be unusual for somebody to be released on their first parole board hearing, particularly somebody with the herstory such as Kenneth Noye. But on the other hand, he may have been in an open prison and satisfied the prison authorities that he is no longer be a risk to the public. But for Stephen Cameron’s parents, they’ve is no doubt what the decision should be. Coming up later in the programme. As the Mayor prepares to return home, we assess the impact of his US trip on London’s profile, and his own. One of the main entrances to Finsbury Park station is to close until 2017. Some commuters have criticised TFL plans to create the new entrance at Wells Terrace, saying that they fear it will create overcrowding. But TFL says the new project will speed up journeys throughout the station. Finsbury Park’s two remaining two entrances will stay open. A soldier from Crawley who lost both legs on duty in Afghanistan is to become one of the first to receive new, life-changing surgery. Sergeant jay Baldwin was serving with the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment when he stepped on a bomb nearly three years ago. The treatment he’ll receive is known as osseo-integration and will give him permanently fitted artificial limbs. Six London boroughs are ranked in the ten worst performing areas in the UK for food hygiene. Research conducted by the Consumer group, Which?, has found many foot outlets in parts of the capital fail to meet acceptable standards. Enfield is named as the worst performing local authority. From there, Victoria Hollins reports. This woman is about to make an ad announced inspection at an infield takeaway and the owner is not very happy to see her. I have shown you mY happy to see her. I have shown you my idea and I have power of entry. It is one of 2500 places serving food in infield but the consumer group says the borough is the worst in the country for maintaining food standards. Having thousands of places to inspectors not a reason to be on the bottom ten. We have found local authorities with thousands more to inspect but they are doing a betterjob of making sure the outlets are compliant. And this is the sort of thing inspectors are up against. Infield say they are being punished for prosecuting a large number of businesses and don’t recognise the findings. All they do is count how many times you prosecute people which is exactly what we are supposed to do. We get marked down for prosecuting but I am sorry to say that is not right. The picture was not good across London. As well as infield, five other boroughs were in the bottom ten. Lewisham and Ealing and Camden and rent. It is not that easy to find out how clean a restaurant is because they are not obliged to show that anywhere on the premises. If you really want to find out you have to go to the Food Standards Agency website and who does that before they eat out? I am very worried when I go to restaurants. On occasion I have looked. It is something you think about? I would only go to a restaurant if it looks nice. At the infield takeaway beard is no major problem. Sometimes they become a bit complacent and have plans to do work and that can happen and they put it off. No councils like the takeaway will have to make some big changes. All this week the Mayor has been touring the states, drumming up trade links and business for London. Amongst other things his six day visit has seen a possible deal to bring one of the world’s best known museums to the Olympic Park. But some have questioned whether Boris johnson’s trip has been about boosting the capital’s international standing or about raising the his own profile? Our Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer sent this report from Washington. The message ITIESSBQE WGS out of Dodge! One weekend three cities with new friends and plenty of dressing to impress. What’s wrong with that? Ouibbling about my personal appearance. They may or was visiting the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, promising to open a new branch in London. To get an institution like this, it world-class museum, to send stuff to the east of London would be amazing. We have never had anything like it. Plus of course the Victoria and Albert Museum and other things. But that will not happen until 2021, so what about the other events? It is called! The May are promised to look cat plans to tunnel roads under parts of London but that will not happen here. In New York, he was intrigued by radiation detectors worn by police, promising to Doctor Scotland Yard about it. But the force cannot spend the tens of millions. Look at that! We have had him clowning around with a lot of jokes but a bit of business as well and what we have seen is a guy who is keen to approach the world in a humourless and light-hearted fashion but who underneath it all has a deadly serious intent. He would argue for the country but it is hard to accept that some of this is for Borisjohnson himself. Welcome to New York. I know what is your birthplace! It was a successful meeting with Hillary Clinton. It helped boost his profile on the world stage. It is for a good cause. After seven days of charging round the States, what has he achieved? Hasn’t been a good week for London or better for Boris johnson? Hasn’t been a good week for London or better for Borisjohnson? I say overall he comes out of this as the real winner. overall he comes out of this as the realwinner. He has overall he comes out of this as the real winner. He has raised as an international profile. It can only help with people like Hillary Clinton onside when it comes to his long-term ambitions. It has been a trip of a London than trying to get a bigger understanding in America of what is happening in London, and the huge opportunities. What about prime ministerial ambitions? That isjust ministerial ambitions? That is just them ministerial ambitions? That isjust them being very generous and polite with a visiting British politician. But that he knows, it is notjust Americanjournalists. A cyclist who had his bike stolen in Islington has been reunited with it in Spain, thanks to the power of social media. james Vernon’s Eli,000 custom-made bike was taken from his flat last summer. He then tweeted the account @stolenride which helps to find Londoners’ stolen bikes, and one user found it for sale on a Spanish website. This is definitely my prized possession so I was so upset. To lose hope but then to time a party train station in a foreign country and see it, I cannot describe it, one of the best things ever. And you can see the full interview with james on the BBC London Facebook page. It was a very special day for one policeman today. The country’s longest serving of us are retiring. He was given a guard of honour and said he was overwhelmed by the number of people that stand out. It ended with it all began, at Croydon police station in south London. In a vintage Morris Minor Panda used at the start of this career in the 1960s, PC Bob Brown stepped out to a hero’s sendoff to conclude his service to the communities of London stretching back A7 years. I am totally emotional. Overwhelmed by the fact everybody has timed out for this. just marvellous and I cannot thank them enough. It has been a career full of challenges. He was one of the first officers to be deployed to the Brixton riots in 1981. All we had was the shield. As soon as we got off we were bombarded with bricks and bottles. We got detached and ended up in a war zone with upside-down cars and houses on fire. Very frightening. The darkest day in his career came in 1994 when he watched helplessly as his colleague lost his life. He had been starved of responding to an armed robbery at a post-office in Surrey. A message came over saying that Derek had been stabbed badly sol went and assisted with the first aid. It was absolutely traumatic. I saw someone attempting open-heart surgery in a garden, doing everything they could. All his colleagues respect him, eight friendly type of respect, notjust because he is a policeman. The only people that don’t like him are the criminals he has caught. He started on the beat with little more than a wooden truncheon and they’ve whistle but ended with the respect of colleagues and Londoners. Even in retirement, he intends to do voluntary work. A life of service is the only one he knows. And thank you and good luck to him. They’re some of the most deprived boroughs in the UK, and today the leaders of nine councils have called for more control to help regenerate east London. They want a greater say on matters like Housing, employment and Transport. The hope is to have more powers devolved to them from Westminster in a similar way to Scotland and Manchester. Alice Bha nd hu kravi reports. From the Olympics to the extension of the London overground, there has been a lots of development and change around here and now a strategic changes being proposed, an alliance bringing borrowers together. Some years ago we brought devolution to London when the Mayor of London got a number of powers but some are better at the Mayor of London got a number of powers but some are better default we have come together representing 2.5 million people and we want to see employment powers passed down. East London has already benefited from the massive investment in the 2012 games, but its politicians say beard is still a long way to go to level the playing field and they point to the fact the population is growing faster than anywhere else in the country. It also tops the polls for deprivation. Of the 33 boroughs, nine account for 63% of the most deprived in the capital, so the leaders of those got together to talk about officially joining forces. From Greenwich south of the river to Enfield in the North. We do have opportunities present clear that required a second language. Thisjob centrally present clear that required a second language. This job centrally fills vacancies in the borough but Newham Council would like its remit to cover all nine borrowers and job-seekers agreed. It is beneficial for all of us, so having it in different boroughs would benefit everyone, especially the youth. He only encompasses new and that is a very small area. If I found a job I like, are areas are not far. I have a lot of friends who live in Tower Hamlets trying to getjobs and there’s nothing like this that help them. East London’s leaders also want to take control of bus routes, just one of seven areas they say could be better run locally. They will have to talk a good talk to convince the Mayo and Treasury if they want their way and will have to do that before the elections. Now it’s a big weekend for FA Cup action - with more on that and the rest of the sport it’s over to Sara Orchard. Thanks, Riz. Plenty on offer this weekend but we start with the competition that began way back in August - the FA Cup. There are nowjust 16 teams left with a chance of lifting the famous trophy. It’s the fifth round this weekend, so places in the quarterfinals are at stake. There are four teams from in and around the capital still with dreams of making it to the Wembley final on the 30th May. Chris Slegg has the details. They have been big shocks. Less shocking results. And there have been goalkeeping shockers as the capital’s teams have fallen, but still on the March are West Ham, onlyjust. Fifa could have kicked them out of the cup after Sakho scored clear winner in the round four. Can they make the most of the repeat? In the latter stages it becomes very important. We have been safe in the league with a good possession and that has always been the main focus from when we first played Everton to try to get as far as we can. Championship side reddening face a team from their own division, having seen of Cardiff in round four, now taking on Derby. We will go there and give a good account of ourselves. Hopefully we can give our supporters a good day. The tie of the event takes place here at Selhurst Park where Crystal Palace meet Liverpool in a match which evokes memories of one of the greatest FA Cup ties of modern times. Alan Pardew scored the semifinal winner against Liverpool 25 years ago. A sore throat meant he had to leave press duties today to his assistant. Some of the big boys out of the competition now and the way we’re playing we feel confident. Arsenal are at home to Middlesbrough. Championship opponents toppled giants Manchester City. Looking at their recent record, it is impressive. We want to stop that. But Wembley moving into view and all to play for on the fifth round weekend. Tomorrow our radio station BBC London Digital Radio will bring you two FA Cup commentaries, with West Brom hosting West Ham at 12.45, then in the evening it’s Crystal Palace at home to Liverpool kicking off at 5.30. Earlier today, Queens Park Rangers announced that that the board has accepted the resignation of chief executive Philip Beard, who will leave the club on 15th March. Beard has been at Loftus Road for three-and-a-half years. The news comes a day after the club confirmed that caretaker manager Chris Ramsey will take charge of the team until the end of the season. QPR are currently 17th in the Premier League. Tottenham striker Harry Kane is set for his first England call-up, with coach Roy Hodgson all but confirming he’d be in his upcoming squad. Kane has scored 23 goals in 35 games this season and Hodgson says he’s everything you look for in a centre forward. Next month England play Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier and Italy in a friendly. Chelsea Ladies midfielder Katie Chapman is expected to return to England duty tonight after a four year absence, for the friendly match against the USA in Milton Keynes. The mother-of-three’s International exile came after a dispute with the former England boss Hope Powell over childcare issues. New head coach Mark Sampson is confident that the issues which prevented Chapman from playing for England have now been resolved. Tomorrow, Harlequins flanker Chris Robshaw will lead out England against Italy at Twickenham in the Six Nations. After beating Wales in their opening game at the Millennium Stadium last week captain Robshaw has been looking forward to getting back their home advantage tomorrow. We are excited to be back at Twickenham. You don’t get to play there as often as you like so we have to go there and make the most of it. Hopefully there will be a huge support and the crowd will be noisy. We are excited. And if you’re in the Twickenham area tomorrow, England against Italy kicks off at 2.30pm. Full coverage of the match right here on BBC One. They made political statements with their songs and were London through and through. The Clash were the definitive punk rock band with hits like London Calling and Rock the Casbah. Now founding member Mickjones is helping a new generation of musicians find their voice, as Wendy Hurrell has been finding out. ~ I follow the music wherever it takes me. I try to be true to that. And more than 30 years after Kenneth Noye bat-mac The Clash hit the mainstream, a band of siblings. We didn’t have as many arguments as we would have. While mediating the family clashes, Mickjones produced their new album from this once dilapidated Indian restaurant. Every date or not dressed up in a suit and he brought as blueberries as well.

Punk was antiestablishment and do it yourself, exactly what these girls have had in London. And they release their music on LPs. Mickjones knows the importance. You have all your music on an MP3 player, and you do not have all the stuff that goes with it. Disintegration in 1986 finished The Clash and Mickjones said he would not work with the band’s music again. Rather than seeing no I will say maybe. Right, let’s get a check on the weekend weather, Helen Willetls has got the forecast for us. It has been called and cloudy as we chatted about yesterday, not so-called but pouring down. This is how the rainfall is going across the UK at the moment. We have had this band of rain moving towards the eastern side of the Thames. A band of really quite potent showers moving and following. They have got he lands under and as you can imagine it is not going to be particularly pleasant if you are on the roads. Many are for the start of half term, so lots of water to contend with. Then it tends to ease a little but there will still be heavy showers around and it is worth noting we have had gales on the coast as well. It is gusty so not that cold but actually because of all the clouds around it will probably be murky. This is the culprit. Low pressure setting across as overnight and tomorrow it is really slow to pull away but it is pulling away and we will find the showers will ease in intensity and number. Really a grey and murky and there could be a lot of fog and the showers go on and off through the day, not a wash-out with the a lot of dry weather. A little milder than it has been and if you’re heading to the rugby at Twickenham air is always the small chance of a shower but hopefully not off- putting. Then through tomorrow evening and overnight, a smattering of showers here and there, not particularly cold but where there are breaks in the clouds, quite murky. Sunday looks like the dire half of the weekend for our region so great weather for getting out and about, like twins as well so if there are few bright and sunny spells, mainsail sees feeling quite pleasant, will it last? Unfortunately, probably not. Saturday Unfortunately, probably not. Saturday the rain clears away with the a lot of dry weather this weekend and through Monday, later in the day, heavy rain saw the start of half term looks fairly decent with the big splash of rain later on in the day into Tuesday. New figures suggest the numbers of people drinking heavily in the UK is falling, particularly among younger age groups, with one in five people not dinking alcohol at all. Deaths from alcohol are now also at their lowest rate for 15 years. There’s evidence to show that HMRC failed to prosecute a wealthy businessman, who hadn’t paid any tax for over two decades. Paul Bloomfield had a fortune of millions of pounds, but didn’t file a single tax return. The former television weatherman, Fred Talbot, has been convicted of indecently assaulting two teenage boys when he was a teacher in the 1970s. Ajury found him not guilty of charges against three other boys. Road rage killer Kenneth Noye has been given the chance to argue for his release at a parole hearing. He wasjailed for life for the murder of Stephen Cameron in 1996 during a fight on the M25. More on the day’s stories on our website. And Asad Ahmad will be back with our late news.

78,BBC1 London,13-feb-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"SHE HITS IMPRESSIVE HIGH NOTE Tonight at Ten, a sober new generation. New figures show a decline in binge-drinking among young British adults. Fewer young adults are choosing to drink and are drinking less when they do. We know the health risks and we know that it can affect you, whereas I don’t think people had the knowledge back then. We’ll be asking what’s led to this continuing fall in how much we drink. Also tonight, the millionaire businessman who didn’t pay tax for over two decades. How Revenue & Customs failed to prosecute. Nigeria’s battle with Boko Haram. We report on the civilians who managed to escape the jihadists. The German city of Dresden remembers the victims of the Allied bombings of 1945. Virgin announces big plans to expand its broadband network, but not everyone will benefit. And why Barack obama’s been fooling around in the White House. Tonight on BBC London: The M25 killer, Kenneth Noye, will get a parole hearing, but his victim’s family say he should die in prison. And we look at London’s postcode lottery for food hygiene. Good evening. The UK looks set to throw off its reputation for binge-drinking, with figures out today showing the numbers of people drinking heavily is falling among younger age groups. For people between the ages of 16 and Ali, binge-drinking has gone down by a third, and frequent drinking by more than two thirds since 2005. There are regional variations but overall more than a fifth of UK adults now say they don’t drink alcohol at all. Here’s our health editor Hugh Pym. Enjoying a drink tonight. This pub was busy like most others on any Friday evening, but figures today suggest the British appetite for booze, especially among young people, could be waning, as some of these drinkers acknowledge. I can see myself probably at one point saying, OK, this is getting a bit ridiculous, it is probably time now to rein it in. I’ve definitely cut back, actually. It is a social thing. You come out, you are with your friends, you still drink. Binge-drinking for men is defined as more than eight units of alcohol on a drinking day. For women it is six. The survey be the Office for National Statistics tracked changes between 2005 and 2013. 21% of adults said they did not drink at all, an increase over the period. 18% of young people admitted to binge-drinking once that week. The key question from these figures is whether there has been a significant change in people’s behaviour as a result of consistent messages about the health dangers of excessive consumption of alcohol. One topic like to follow up today is alcohol. .. like to follow up today is alcohol... Lessons about the dangers of drink are being taught in the classroom, like at this school in Glasgow, and judging by these pupils, the message is getting through. You don’t need alcohol to socialise with your friends and have a good night. You can do other things. Because we know the health risks now and we know it can affect you. Whereas I don’t think people have the knowledge back then and they were just get drunk and have a hangover and then feel fine. At a time of continuing debate about the social and health impact of drinking, medicaland health social and health impact of drinking, medical and health experts gave a cautious reaction to the findings of the report. There is some optimism and things seem to be improving in terms of consumption over the last two or three years but it has to be said this is against the backdrop of a huge increase over the last 30 or Ao years and we are nowhere near back to where we were. There is another factor - nowhere near back to where we were. There is another factor - London, a highly diverse city, has the largest percentage of teetotallers in the UK. Nearly a third of adults. Some of those, as in other communities, are not drinking for cultural reasons. With me now is our home editor, Mark Easton. What’s led to this change in drinking, particularly among younger people? It is amazing, isn’t it? The binge-drinking job was almost sure hand for British troubled youth but every year it goes by it becomes more on representative because actually young people today are much more likely than their parents to be teetotal and more likely than their grandparents now to be teetotal, and it is notjust alcohol, which has, to some extent, fallen out of fashion with young people. Consumption of drugs and alcohol and they smoke less. It is cultural in the sense of lifestyle and I think young people go out less. They are in their bedrooms on their computers and on Facebook because it is expensive to go out. Maybe they are doing homework, too. Maybe the messages are getting through. That is one thing. Certainly the management of the night-time economy has got better. But another factor is diversity and if you look at the date of the places with high levels of immigration tend to have lower levels of problem with drinking, so London, as you are saying, a third of people teetotal! A third! It is around half of that in the north-west and north-east. So I think we are seeing the cultural dynamic of drinking changing across the country. New documents obtained by the BBC show that HM Revenue & Customs failed to prosecute a wealthy businessman who hadn’t paid a single penny in tax for over two decades. Property investor Paul Bloomfield’s fortune was estimated at £60 million in 2006. But the documents reveal that he didn’t file a tax return for 24 years. HMRC wouldn’t comment on his specific case but said it considered many factors when deciding what action to take. Richard Bilton reports. Private jets, helicopters and luxury homes. Paul Bloomfield lived a lavish lifestyle, but for 20 years he didn’t pay a penny in tax. It was projects like the re-development of Wembley Stadium that made Mr Bloomfield his money. In 2006, his fortune was estimated at £60 million. I have never seen anyone spending money as if there was no tomorrow and he had so many organisations, accountants, lawyers to work for him and hide that money for him. But despite his lavish lifestyle, he didn’t pay the taxman a single penny from 1987 to 2011. In 2011, Mr Bloomfield was summoned here to an HMRC office in Central London. The BBC has seen a transcript of that meeting between Mr Bloomfield and the tax inspectors, and it makes for extraordinary reading. Mr Bloomfield said he had no income. He told tax inspectors the homes, the private plane, had all been paid for by other people. Mr Bloomfield wanted the taxman to believe he was a pauper leading a millionaire’s lifestyle. But the minutes show he lived in a succession of properties in the swankiest bits of London. The taxman didn’t believe him and said he owed tax for the past 20 years, but they didn’t prosecute. The BBC has seen documents that show they missed a straightforward opportunity to prove Mr Bloomfield’s dishonesty. He told the taxman he had never had an account in an offshore bank. But files leaked this week to Panorama show he had an HSBC account in Switzerland. HMRC already had those files. They should have known it was a lie. We showed the documents to a former tax inspector who is now a journalist. Based on what the Revenue say about their approach to prosecution, that they prosecute the most serious cases where there have been lies and where there’s a serious amount of tax involved as there is here, a huge amount, and it is over a sustained period of time, which it is here, at least 20 years, then this would be the case that you would expect HMRC to prosecute. We think Mr Bloomfield is living in Spain. Despite many attempts to reach him he didn’t respond to our questions. We don’t know whether Mr Bloomfield eventually paid any tax. HMRC won’t talk about individual cases and say a wide range of factors is taken into account when deciding on a course of action. But they did confirm that the man who didn’t pay tax for 24 years wasn’t prosecuted. The chief executive of HSBC Stuart Gulliver has admitted that the bank sometimes failed to live up to the standards expected by society. His comments were revealed in a leaked memo to staff over allegations of tax avoidance at the bank’s Swiss subsidiary. Earlier this week HSBC admitted failings in compliance and controls in its Swiss bank. The former TV weatherman Fred Talbot has been convicted of historical sex offences. Ajury found him guilty of assaulting two teenage boys while he was a teacher at a grammar school in the 1970s. He’s expected to be sentenced next month. judith Moritz reports from Manchester. Right, over the north of Scotland a lot of cloud... Fred the weatherman was known for his fun, floating forecasts. Millions watched. But amongst them were his victims, distressed to see their abuser finding fame on national television. Fred Talbot had a sexual interest in teenage boys and as a teacher in Cheshire in the 1970s and ‘80s he had ready access to them. He knew it was wrong, noting in his diary, ""I must watch how often I’m seen with kids."" The page I’ve gone to, I opened randomly, the page is April 1969. But he kept trying to hide his past even once arrested and presented with the evidence in hisjournals. Is that your handwriting there? No comment. He denied the diary was his but then let this slip. Oh, God, my writing’s dreadful! Black something in two cars. So that is your writing then, in your diary? No comment. Fred Talbot taught biology and astronomy here from 1974. He says he was a really good teacher with an informal style. But he resigned after a decade, later saying publicly it was so he could start his media career. In fact it was because he had propositioned two teenage boys. Talbot often took his pupils on canal boat trips. They’d drink alcohol and he indecently assaulted two of them. Detectives say Talbot’s never shown any remorse. As a teacher he had responsibility to nurture and safeguard those under his care, a responsibility he was proven to have no regard for and he abused them in an appalling way. Why not come to Britain on holiday? Fred Talbot’s TV career is now over. Tonight he’s in prison and he could face further prosecution, too. The Scottish authorities are examining allegations that he offended there as well. Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have, for the first time, launched an attack in neighbouring Chad. The extremists, who want to create their own state, have intensified assaults against nearby countries in recent weeks. Since 2010, Boko Haram has been responsible for more than 13,000 deaths, the majority of them in the past year. 1.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes. Elections due tomorrow in Nigeria have been postponed for six weeks to allow time to deal with the escalating violence. Tomi Oladipo went to the town of Yola, which has been overwhelmed by people displaced from their homes. Fun. Even in the grimmest of places. An escape from the horrors they have been through. But for the grown-ups, forgetting is not so easy. This camp, the only refuge these families have. 13-year-old Mika came here alone. When Boko Haram attacked his home, he ran into the forest but he got separated from his family and hasn’t seen them for weeks. TRANSLATION: I left so quickly. If I had more time I would have brought my bicycle and my shoes. Dozens of makeshift camps have sprung up all around Yola town, in churches, mosques and even in people’s homes. They are filled with those who fled months and months of brutal Boko Haram attacks. We have spoken to many of them and their stories are often harrowing. Helen is 17. She was captured and escaped from Boko Haram several times. She told me she was badly beaten, and the memory of one moment still haunts her. TRANSLATION: They were mean, angry and shouting. We were peeking through the window. They lined up seven men and slit their throats like rams. Boko Haram is attacking village after village. Are you worried about them? Ibrahim is from Gulak. He fled when Boko Haram attacked, but without his wife, Hadiza. Why do they want to kill you? I no gonejoin. Because you don’t want to join them? Obviously you left your family, how do you feel? I’m not feeling normal. Hadiza is distant. It is only two weeks since she escaped. TRANSLATION: They said, you are our war prize. Your husband is not here. You are our loot. She was held captive for five months. There is an imposing military presence in Yola. This is one of Africa’s largest armies, so why can’t they defeat Boko Haram? The men, they come in thousands. These two soldiers have been in fierce battles. They are not authorised to speak to us so we have hidden their identities. What I am getting from this simply is that if you have the right equipment you would be able to win this? Galla ntly. If we have the right equipment, we actually chase them away. Nigeria has postponed its elections to give the government six more weeks to get the insurgency under control. But they have been fighting Boko Haram for six years and the attacks have now spread to neighbouring countries. So it’s difficult to see how the violence will end so soon. Tomi Oladipo, BBC News, Yola. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed tonight that a consignment of British military vehicles has been delivered to Ukraine. It followed reports from a Ukrainian news agency which said 20 Saxon armoured cars had been sent to the government in Kiev. Our correspondent Carole Walker is in Downing Street. What’s the significance of this development? Well, we have had confirmation that 20 Saxon armoured vehicles have been delivered, with another 55 expected to arrive soon. These are vehicles that were taken out of service three years ago. They have been sold on by the agency that deals with obsolete military equipment, and the MOD are stressing these are unarmed vehicles, not Britain sending lethal aid or equipment into this conflict. Only this week the Foreign Secretary said that Britain was not prepared to arm the Ukrainian forces, although he said that position could be reviewed in future. We know the United States is considering doing so. But what is clear is that the Ukrainian authorities are going to waste no time in mounting weapons onto these vehicles. And there is no doubt that the Russians, who have faced repeated accusations that they are sending arms and troops to help the rebels, there is no doubt that authorities in Moscow will see this as a provocative move. I should also say that the timing is highly sensitive, with the cease-fire in Ukraine due to come into force at midnight on Saturday. Thank you. Taking HRT for even short periods of time can increase the risk of ovarian cancer, according to a study published today.

He’d been transporting rubble on Monday when he lost control of the lorry, hitting vehicles and pedestrians. Police refused to say whether they would be questioning the teenager now that he is out of hospital. The Daily Mirror has publicly apologised for phone hacking. A statement in the paper said it was an ""unacceptable intrusion into people’s lives"". The paper’s owner is setting aside £12 million for claims for damages. Accident & Emergency hospitals in England have shown an improvement in treating patients within four hours. A ceremony of commemoration has taken place in the German city of Dresden, 70 years after Allied bombing killed around 25,000 people and left much of the city in ruins. Today thousands of anti-Nazi demonstrators paraded through the city, while survivors and dignatories remembered those who lost their lives. Fergal Keane reports from Dresden. At 14 minutes past ten on the night of the 13th of February 1945, the first Allied bombs were dropped on Dresden. What followed was a firestorm that killed an estimated 25,000 people. 70 years later, Dresden remembered, joined by visitors from a British city which suffered bombing at German hands. This candle is from Coventry and represents peace and reconciliation. Germany’s president came and warned about the return of far right politics, a strong theme in a city where such groups are on the rise. And for one British visitor, the fate of Dresden offered a universal lesson about the brutalisation caused by war. Things that at the beginning of a war no one would think of, by the end become in people’s minds justifiable. You can’t blame them for that. There is no blame attached. It is the nature of war. Dresden has been rebuilt and its memories of war belong to a vanishing generation. Among those remembering the night of fire is this man. Like many German youngsters, he was enrolled in the Hitler Youth by his parents. He was 12 on the night of the bombing. ""We could see the whole city burning"", he said. ""The entire sky was glowing red from the firestorm"". Your father had been a Nazi supporter. What did he say when the bombing happened, what was his response? ""There were ten of us in the cellar"", he told me, ""and my father said, ""You know who to thank for this, the criminal"", meaning Hitler. Normally saying this you risked getting shot, but that might nobody challenged him"". Earlier, anti-Nazi marchers played the music of eastern Europe’s vanished jews. 70 years on, they are countering the far right by remembering that Nazi past. There were people who did very evil things, and we want to make sure that we know where they were and who they were and what they did. This demonstration symbolises how the past resonates in today’s Dresden. But it’s notjust about the experience of the bombing. For these people, the past is a warning against the dangers of racial extremism. Tonight, thousands formed a human chain in the city. From Dresden, a message of tolerance to a troubled world. Fergal Keane, BBC News, Dresden. 6000 jobs are to be created after Virgin Media announced plans to invest £3 billion in expanding its broadband network. The company says its five-year plan is the biggest single investment in digital infrastructure in the UK for more than ten years. But how far will it go in closing the gap between the digital haves and have-nots? Rory Cellan-jones reports. This is Virgin Media’s superfast fibre-optic broadband. Britain’s broadband race is hotting up. Virgin is planning to take on rivals like BT and Sky with a big expansion of its network, and its boss certainly isn’t underplaying this moment. This is as significant as the building of the railways in the 19th century or the motorway network in the 20th. Top speed broadband is essential to economic development and to people’s lives. In Glasgow this morning they were already laying the cables that will bring superfast broadband to streets where Virgin hasn’t offered a service until now. For the most part, the expansion of the network will be in urban areas, hooking up streets which were left out when cable TV first came to Britain. Even in the heart of London’s Soho, you can’t get a Virgin broadband connection right now. For one thing, it just costs too much to get permission to dig up the streets. That’s going to change. One thing isn’t. Large areas of rural Britain won’t benefit from this announcement. The village of Seagrave is not far from Leicester but is still very much in the broadband slow lane. Virgin won’t be coming here any time soon and local businesses say they are at a real disadvantage in this fast internet era. I can understand why the large broadband providers like Virgin prioritise their spending, but it is leading to a situation where rural communities are being left out. There’s a large chunk of us as well, so there’s a danger of a two-nation state when it comes to broadband access, and I think that’s just not right. I need to get stuck into this. But the Prime Minister, visiting Virgin’s operation in Birmingham said the company was helping to build a superfast nation with world-class infrastructure. The government is putting money from the TV licence fee into rural fast broadband, with the target of reaching 95% of homes by 2017. But rural campaigners say too many places are going to be left out. And they fear the broadband gap between town and country is only going to widen. Rory Cellan-jones, BBC News. And this is the latest internet sensation to go viral, the President of the United States as you have never seen him. In the video, the most powerful man in the world is seen goofing around in front of the mirror and trying to look sharp in a pair of shades. So, what is he up to? It is an advert for his health care reforms and it has already been a ratings slam dunk, having been watched over 25 million times injust over 24 hours. Mr President? Can I live? You do you. YOLO, man. All right. YOLO - that’s ""you only live once"". That’s it from us. Now the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The mother of a man stabbed to death by a notorious criminal on the M25 motorway almost 20 years ago says she’s writing to the Home Secretary to stop him being released so he can die in prison. Kenneth Noye was jailed for life for the murder of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron in 1996. Here’s our home affairs correspondent, Nick Beake. We’ve got lovely memories of him. He had a lovely life. You don’t realise how happy you were until it’s taken away. It may be nearly 20 years since their son was murdered by Kenneth Noye, but for the Camerons, their pain is still deep and war. It’sjust a terrible their pain is still deep and war. It’s just a terrible thing to lose your child and I wouldn’t wish it on anybody. It never goes away. Our hearts are broken and they can never mend. It was a spring morning back in 1996 when Kenneth Noye attacked Stephen on a slip road on the M25 in Kent. He stabbed the 21-year-old to deathin Kent. He stabbed the 21-year-old to death in front of his fiancee using a 9 inch blade he kept in his car. Now the killer could, technically, be free within weeks. He should stay in prison until the day he dies. He has always been an evil man and he should never come out of prison. Kenneth Noye is now 67 but he embarked on a life of crime when he was a young man. But in 1983 he became a suspect in a £26 million robbery at Heathrow Airport. Two years later, when officers were watching his mansion, he started together an undercover police officer. He was cleared of murder after pleading self defence but was sent to prison first -- after pleading self defence but was sent to prison first -- handling stolen gold. By 1996 he had been freed and killed Stephen Cameron on the M25. He fled to Spain before being extradited a few years later. In 2000 he was found guilty of Stephen’s murder and was told to serve the minimum of 16 years. Now that term is nearly up, Kenneth Noye can apply for a parole hearing, but whether he is released is a completely different matter. It would be unusual for somebody to be released, I think, would be unusual for somebody to be released, Ithink, on released, I think, on their first Parole Board hearing, especially somebody with a a history such as Kenneth Noye. We would have to convince the prison authorities he ",,

""unacceptable"" for tournament play. Later on BBC London: A father prepares to sue Essex Police over the investigation into his son’s death. Plus, another chilly afternoon ahead. Your full local and national forecast is coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. After all-night talks between Russia and Ukraine, Germany’s Chancellor Merkel says there’s now a ""glimmer of hope"" for an end to the fighting in eastern Ukraine. A ceasefire will come into force at midnight on Saturday. The two sides have also agreed to withdraw heavy weapons from the front line and to create buffer zones between the opposing forces. We’ll be getting the latest from Moscow and Ukraine in a moment, but first Richard Galpin on the outcome of those marathon peace talks. The two men at the heart of the conflict. The Ukrainian and Russian Presidents, brought together for this critical summit here. The mutual mistrust, eve department throughout the long, tense negotiations. With Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel persistently driving the diplomacy forward, the pressure was on to reach a deal. And after a marathon 15 hourt exhausted leaders emerged to announce they had reached an agreement. The Ukrainian President said there will be a ceasefire, accompanied by the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front lines by both the Russian-backed rebels and the Ukrainian forces. This is the year of eastern Ukraine which has been fought over and where the ceasefire is due to begin at midnight on Saturday. With heavy weapons, including rocket launchers, expected to be pulled out from the buffer zone. One detail that is clear is that all prisoners should be released by both sides. The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, welcomed the agreement. He said it took so long to reach because the Ukrainian Government refuses to negotiate directly with the rebels. TRANSLATION: Unfortunately the Kiev authorities refuse to have direct contact with representatives of the republics. Despite the fact they are not recognised, one has to face the realities. If you want to work for a long-term solution, you need to work in direct contact. Now that the leaders have all left this palace here in Minsk. Of course the key question is whether the ceasefire will be implemented this weekend. And if it is, will it last? Or will it be like the previous, signed last September, which fell apart within days. Certainly overnight the fighting continued in eastern Ukraine, despite the peace talks. The damage in the rebel-held city of Donetsk visible this morning. Amongst the buildings which had been hit was a hospital. Getting the fighting to stop will certainly not be easy. Already one rebel commander has told the BBC they will not stop fighting because so many of their people have died. Our correspondent is in Moscow. It looks positive, but we have been here before. Well, that is right. Many people have been saying, well what happened to the Minsk accords of last September - what happened to the Minsk accords of last September - everybody hoped there would be a ceasefire. It looked like there might, but the fighting started soon after. By the end of the year it had escalated into a full-scale conflict again. This is a more detailed accord. It has the leaders of France and Germany backing it. And the very fact so many people have been saying this is a last chance, if this doesn’t work, then the conflict could spiral out of control. Maybe it will be a reason why there is more political will, both at the top and perhaps lower down to make it work. It is difficult. It’s not until Sunday, in effect, that this ceasefire is supposed to take place. That is plenty of time for there to be more exchanges of fire and for each side to claim the other doesn’t have any confidence in their opponent. And there is, we know, no agreement over the area where there has been fierce fighting. This is an area which in the next few days we could see a lot of violence. And in terms of whapss then, there’s still so much -- terms of whapss then, there’s still so much -- what happens then, there’s still so much to sort out evenif there’s still so much to sort out even if the ceasefire holds. That is right. Everyone is saying this is a first step. They have agreed on the ceasefire, on a demilitarised zone, which will be overseen by Russian commands. They have agreed on the pull-back of heavy weaponry. That is key - very difficult to do - pull-back of heavy weaponry. That is key - very difficult to do - once it is done, all that heavy artillery, it is out of action until it is moved again. Both sides have expressed concerned about the mechanism to make it work. The key concern is if they will go back to The Bank of England has said that interest rates could fall if low inflation persists. The Governor, Mark Carney, said it was likely that inflation would turn negative by the spring. Our economics correspondent, Andrew Verity, reports. At this Essex farm, they have found out what falling prices mean for them. The plummeting price of diesel has slashed the price of getting crops out of the ground. When you come to sell them there’s so much produce around it is harder to fetch a decent price. We are seeing global prices which have fallen due to oversupply. We have seen two consecutive big global prices. Wheat prices have come done 25% from last year. What is bad for producers though can be good for consumers, who have been saving on cheaper food and petrol. With services more expensive, on average prices are edging up. But today, the Governor of the Bank of England said he expects that to change. The average price will fall for the first time in decades. Inflation is at its lowest level since the introduction of inflation targeting two decades ago. It will likely fall further, potentially turn negative in the spring and be zero for remainder of the year. What could possibly go wrong? Maybe nothing if it is temporary. If you want to make a big purchase when prices are falling, it makes sense to put it off. If we all think like that there could be a slump in spending and we might miss something about inflation, it shrinks your debts F I borrow £130O to buy this bike, that debt would not grow with inflation. As prices go up, I would have not grow with inflation. As prices go up, Iwould have more money not grow with inflation. As prices go up, I would have more money to PHY go up, I would have more money to pay it back but the debt stays the same. After so many years it will not seem much at all. With deflation, your debts grow. If prices keep falling for too long the Bank of England said it could deal with it by slashing interest rates, even from their current low of 0.5%. We have many options to provide that stimulus. The eif ekiveness of the stimulus is -- stimulus. The eif ekiveness of the stimulus is -- effectiveness of the stimulus is helped by the financial system. The falls in food and fuel could be pry. -- could be temporary. There are claims the Labour leader made in the House of Commons yesterday. Lord Fink warned he would sue for demapation in the comments were made in public. Our correspondent is in North London. Ed Miliband didn’t quite say what he said yesterday H eis tackling the Prime Minister head-on. -- said yesterday H eis tackling the Prime Minister head-on. -- he is tackling the Prime Minister head-on. We are involved in a bruising standoff between Ed Miliband and the former treasurer Lord Fink. He is at his old school, but standing by his own remarks. Asking if he stands by his comments in the Commons. Lord Fink was engaged in tax-avoiding activities, I do. Commons. Lord Fink was engaged in tax-avoiding activities, Ido. He went on the offensive and sought to crank up the pressure on David Cameron by seizing on remarks by Lord Fink in The Evening Standard - Lord Fink said, the expression tax avoidance is so wide that everyone does it. Now, Ed Miliband challenged the Prime Minister to say whether he agreed with that and whether he accepted that Lord Fink was now boosting about tax avoidance. In the last few minutes, Lord Fink has hit back with his own statement, in which he said, yesterday I challenged Ed Miliband to repeat the accusations he made that I used an HSBC bank account and I was a dodgy donor. He did not. This is a major climb down by a man who is willing to smear without getting the facts straight. No mention of legal action. Simon, this may not end up in the courts, but it is an important moment. Why? Because clearly Ed Miliband and the Labour Party are determined to brand David Cameron as on the side of tax avoiders and Lord Fink and the Conservative Party are determined to brand Ed Miliband as a man who is willing to smear the innocent for political advantage. Thank you very much. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats say protecting spending on education will be their number one priority if they’re in power after the General Election. Our education correspondent, Alex Forsyth, reports. The number of children in England’s schools is dwroing. The question is how to a-- is growing. The question is how to pay for it. Today, Labour said they could capsizes at 30 for infants and pay for it by curbing new free schools, as explained by Ed Miliband today, as he set out his party’s vision for education. Currently the Government is spending on new free schools in areas where there are surplus places. This makes no sense, particularly when class sizes are rising in the way they are, orwhen sizes are rising in the way they are, or when people cannot get their kids into the good schools they want. By ending the scandalous waste of money by building new schools in areas of surplus places, we will create more where they are needed. The Conservatives say they have doubled spending on new places and point out an existing legal limit of 30 pupils in classes taught by one teacher, saying the Labour policy merely echoes this. But the parties do differ when it comes to school funding. For the next Labour Government will protect the overall education budget, rising budgets, protected in real terms every year, not cut thaz will be under the Conservatives. -- not cut as they will be under the Conservatives. Labour says the announcements will drive up standards in schools. It is clear all parties are driving the election battle towards the classroom. And Alex is here with me now. We know where all parties stand on this Within minutes of the speech the Conservatives are picking over that policy. The Conservatives have promised to protect cash spending per pupil. So the money will follow them through the school. They say overall as pupil numbers grow that means schools will get more money. There’s no departmental protection like we have heard from Labour. We’ve had the Liberal Democrats setting out their stall. Like Labour, they will say they protect spending in real terms from cradle, so early years, right up to college - so post-16 spending and protect for the most deprived pupils and put qualified teachers in every classroom. What we are seeing here is each party trying to convince that for them education is a real priority, notjust for the sake of the children, but also because a lot of parents and teachers vote. Thank you. The leaders of Russia and Ukraine announce a ceasefire beginning at midnight on Saturday - after fighting that’s already claimed thousands of lives. And still to come: The number of Muslim children growing up in England and Wales almost doubles in a decade. In the sport, the toughestjob of my career, Paul Lambert admits to the scale of the task he faced at the relegation threatened club. The number of Muslim children growing up in England and Wales has almost doubled in a decade. A study, commissioned by the Muslim Council of Britain, also shows a rise in the Muslim population by 1.1 million, to 2.7 million. Our religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt reports. It’s a snapshot of Muslims in England and Wales today, younger than most, with a median age of 25, compared with All the wider population. One third are aged 15 or under. Many are entrepreneurs. Like this man, who runs a barber’s shop and works as a cab driver. In recent years, he says, prejudice against Muslims has got worse. You get a lot of prejudice, but also a lot of love, with people who agree with what you’re saying. just because one does bad, like a box of apples, if there is a bad apple in a box, it doesn’t mean all apples are bad. The report’s researchers say Muslims face a double penalty, race discrimination and Islamophobia, and that half of Britain’s Muslims live in deprived areas. Levels of education have risen, especially among young women. They are strategic resource at the time of an ageing population. They feel overwhelmingly British. 73% chose their national identity to be British. Half are born in the UK. That’s 1+7% of the British Muslim population are born in the UK. But just one in five Muslims has a full-time job, just one in five Muslims has a full-timejob, compared full-time job, compared with one in three in the wider population. Some sayjoblessness is behind the alienation felt by some young Muslims. But most here say theyjust want to live in peace. You’ll bring you have to get on with everyone, thatis you have to get on with everyone, that is what it comes down to. Every other country you go to, look what is happening back home, fighting, wars, it’s not good. There are a disproportionate number of Muslims imprisoned here. They form 5% of the overall population, but 13% of the prison population. Taking details from the sensors and breaking it down in relation to a particular community and how it’s doing economic leaked, socially, educationally, is important, because it gives you an idea of what’s happening with the community, and it can dispel myths around the Trinity. All that data can be better used to target areas where more resources tafgÃl BFEBS Wi’IâI’â ITIOFE FESOUFCES may target areas where more resources may be needed. A former doctor has been sentenced to 18 years in jail for indecently assaulting girls at a hospital where jimmy Savile also abused patients. Michael Salmon - who’s 80 - was convicted of nine indecent assaults and two rapes at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire between 1973 and 1988. Police say more women have made allegations against him since the start of the trial. An Egyptian court has ordered the release on bail of the two Al jazeera journalists, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. They have been injail for over a year and were convicted of associating with a banned organisation - the Muslim Brotherhood. The trial of the pair had been scheduled to begin today. Their colleague Peter Greste was deported back to Australia earlier this month. It’s called revenge porn - the publishing of explicit sexual images or videos of former partners - and it becomes a criminal offence in England and Wales today. The maximum sentence will be two years in jail. The law covers content posted online, as well on social media and text message. Our correspondent Rick Kelsey reports. Most of us are protective of our private lives, but what if your most intimate moments were made public against your will? Victims of revenge porn often find out suddenly and through others. Until now, there was no specific law dealing with the problem. 21-year-old Cazine McCarthy had made a video for her boyfriend, who worked away. He asked me to do some intimate things for him. I felt a bit uncomfortable but I did it, being a girlfriend. I didn’t see anything wrong with it, and that’s how he got them, and when we broke up he put them online. Police numbers recorded on revenge porn are tiny but go online and there are dozens of sites dedicated to putting up pictures and videos of ex-partners. And it’s apps and technology that make those images so easy to put up but so difficult to take down. There have been some high-profile cases. Tulisa, Lauren Goodger and Paris Hilton, all had videos leaked to porn sites, though victims are now protected when they haven’t given consent. I felt mortified. There’s no words to describe how you feel when everyone has seen something as intimate as that. It’s horrible. He actually mailed me to say you’ve had 60 followers in one minute, you’re a hit- making jokes about it. But some lawyers have expressed concern about how it will be policed and the potential for hundreds of young people to be criminalised. Number one, whether the police force has the resources to deal with the potential number of complaints and number two, it’s especially important that awareness of this new offence is put out there. One of the big problems with this type of crime is someone’s online footprint. It’s almost impossible to take videos down from sites as they are simply shared and spread to others so the effects can last a lifetime. MPs now hope that by making revenge porn a specific criminal offence they’ll make people think twice about abusing the trust of an ex-partner. Have you ever been frustrated when you receive your insurance renewal- and it tells you the new price but not the previous one to compare it with? The BBC’s You And Yours programme has discovered that one leading insurer has broken ranks with the industry and will provide customers with both figures so they can tell whether they are being charged more. Here’s our personal finance correspondent, Simon Gompertz. Car cover, or home insurance, what you don’t want when renewal time comes is to find, like Chris in Hertfordshire did, that the cost has gone up injumps. Well, when I checked back I found it had gone from 205, to 21+8, to 303, to 366. Each time, the old price for his buildings policy wasn’t there to compare. I felt I’d been taken advantage of with large price increases for a number of years that I hadn’t noticed. When I phoned them and kicked up a fuss they offered to take £50 off, and the last straw was when I went onto the Internet I found I could get the same insurance cover from the same provider, for less than half of the premium they’d quoted me. Another insurer, Axa, is saying that from this month it will include both the old and the new price in its motor renewals, for home as well soon, which is a sign that the reluctance of insurers to remind you what you paid before so you can compare, is crumbling. And the Association of British Insurers has proposed that renewals should include last year’s premium, plus there should be a warning that introductory discounts may not apply on renewal. We recognise the need for greater transparency. The industry is committed to greater transparency. But we want to make sure that transparency applies across the whole of the market, including insurers, brokers and comparison websites. Car and home policies are being investigated by the financial watchdog, the FCA, which could force providers to make clear when the price of insurance is being pushed up. The trial of Brusthom Ziamani, who is accused of planning to behead a British soldier, has been hearing from the defence. Police arrested Mr Ziamani in east London in August last year. He denies preparing an act of terrorism. Our home affairs correspondent june Kelly is at the Old Bailey. This morning, we got an insight into the background of Brusthom Ziamani. He said he was brought up in a very strictjehovah’s He said he was brought up in a very strict jehovah’s Witness household and he said he became eerily unaided from his parents after he developed an interest in girls. He ended up being ostracised, he said, and leaving home. He then said he turned to a life of crime. He said he was mugging and robbing people and seeing prostitutes. He said he became interested in Islam and converted and became a Muslim. He said he watched videos of the well- known preacher Anjem said he watched videos of the well-known preacher Anjem Choudary, well- known preacher Anjem Choudary, and well-known preacher Anjem Choudary, and attended a meeting of the extremist organisation Al-Muhajiroun. He was arrested shortly after he converted to Islam a few months later, and he told a security officer at the prison where he was held that it was planning to behead a British soldier. When he was arrested he had a hammer, a knife and a buzz -- black Islamic flag. This afternoon will get an explanation from him as to why he made that claim about wanting to behead a British soldier. For the first time guidance is being issued on the use of hidden cameras to monitor the care of people who are elderly and vulnerable. The regulator, the Care Quality Commission, has produced a pamphlet that sets out what worried relatives need to consider. Care home owners say they fear it will undermine the trust between families and care workers. Here’s our social affairs correspondent, Alison Holt. 321 times Yvonne Grant called out for someone to help her. Unable to walk, she needed help to get to the toilet, but at this care home it was two and a half hours before anyone took her. Her family put a secret camera into their late grandmother’s room, when they felt no one was listening to their concerns. We didn’t expect to see what we did. We were horrified, shocked. Her grandmother’s care home acted quickly once it was presented with the footage. The guidance from England’s care regulator, the Care Quality Commission, warns that using a hidden camera is a big step. It says recording equipment should only be used in a private room and only if it is in the best interests, or with the consent of the person receiving care. The COC says it will examine any concerns raised. If a provider is providing services that are safe, that are caring and that are high quality, that are effective and responding to people’s needs, then people won’t need to use cameras. At this London spy shop they are seeing a growing number of people buying hidden cameras, so they can check on a relative’s care. With it increasingly easy to get hold of tiny, hidden cameras, today’s guidance from the COC aims to encourage people to think about issues of dignity and privacy before they take that step. Massively disappointed that people felt they needed to do that. But at this meeting of care home owners many hoped families would talk to them before taking such a drastic step. They say what’s needed is better staff training and funding of care. I’m disappointed they are going down this path, which creates a mistrust and almost sinister perspective on where we’re going with surveillance in care homes. For families and those providing the care, the priority is finding ways of ensuring that anyone who is older or vulnerable get the best possible care. And you can find out more about care and how the system works by going to bbc.co.uk/care. The daughter of the boss of airline Korean Air has been jailed for one year for violating aviation safety law - after she lost her temper about the way nuts were served during a flight. Cho Hyun-a ordered a plane to turn back, while it was on a runway in New York because she had been served nuts in a packet instead of a bowl. Our correspondent in Seoul, Stephen Evans, has sent this report. And a warning- it does contain some flash photography. Cho Hyun-a, contrite but not contrite enough. The judge said he didn’t think she was really sorry, so a heavy one-year sentence was needed. Inside this plane, she had a mega tantrum because the nuts in first class were served in a bag, not a bowl. Her father is the airline’s head, so she felt entitled to order the captain to turn back to the gate to have the offending purser put off. It sparked a debate about Korea’s family-owned firms, called chaebols. Samsung is the biggest. You think electronics, but it’s everything from this amusement park to ships, to hospitals, to housing, to funeral homes. On land and the sea, from cradle to grave. Samsung’s head was convicted of tax evasion. Chaebol chairmen are often said to run the company or the group in an emperor-like way. That means they make decisions on their own, without any check or balance or monitoring by the board of the company. For the critics, that car park epitomises the problem. Hyundai motors has paid $10 billion for the whole space, to build a glitzy new headquarters. The sceptics say it’s a vanity project to aggrandise a family firm. Chaebols do give back to the community, like here, where employees hand out coal briquettes to the poor. But the debate is whether the downside of nepotism and hereditary leadership is the right way for the future. Mrs Cho may ruminate on the question in her prison cell. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today. The leaders of Russia and Ukraine announce a cease-fire, beginning midnight on Saturday, after fighting has already claimed thousands of lives. Ina moment, In a moment, the full National bmmu In a moment, the full National forecast and the weather where you are. First, the sport. TigerWoods is taking an indefinite break from golf. Is this the end for him? Yes, it could be the beginning. For him to acknowledge his game isn’t up to scratch shows a real vulnerability that we haven’t seen from Tiger Woods in his 18 years at the top of the sport. There have been 11+ major titles, though he has struggled with his form since his personal life was thrown into the spotlight in 2009-10. He has had no major win in the last seven years. There have been physical problems. He had back surgery last year. He said his current problems, which saw him withdraw from a tournament last week, have nothing to do with his back surgery. He says his current form is unacceptable. He recorded his worst ever round as a professional recently at the Phoenix Open. That is why he is taking an indefinite break. He says he intends to be back playing very soon. That could be as soon as the Honda classic in a couple of weeks. It is clear he has a lot of work to do on his game and his body. If he comes back and back to the top, we will say what a remarkable achievement. If he doesn’t, we have seen the best of one of the best players ever. He has paid tribute to the supporter, who he said were patient with him, as have the club been. Time has run out for Paul Lambert. The fans have taken to singing ""we’ll score again - don’t know where, don’t know when.""' They ""'we""ll score again - don’t know where, don’t know when.""' They have had huge ar rors pointing to the away goals. It was that 2-0 defeat at Hull which was the tipping point. A lot of fans would have liked to have seen this decision made perhaps a month earlier. When the announcement came at 8pm last night, the reaction was that it was about time that Paul Lambert went. Now the speculation begins, as it always does - who will take over here at Villa Park? The man who is the favourite is Tim Sherwood. That is a name always banded around. Perhaps surprisingly Glen Hoodle is getting a lot of backing at the bookies. He""s not been in a managerial position for a long time. Another is Gareth Southgate. Steve McLaren has been mentioned. They have got a little time to appoint a new manager T next Premier League game is not until the weekend after this. There is an important tie on Sunday. A quarterfinal place is is an important tie on Sunday. A quarter final place is something fans would be happy with. Many thanks. David Wilson is out of the Six Nations Championship. He needs surgery on a neck injury. England have named an unchanged side. joseph was among the Tri Scorers last Friday. The coach said it was important to build some consistency and warned Italy would be fired up after a heavy defeat to Ireland in Rome. The number of reported concussions in English rugby rose by 59% last season. The issue was highlighted last weekend when Graham North was allowed to stay on the pitch, despite taking two heavy blows to the head. The sports gove Nigel Farage has promised that what he calls ""Ukip’s people’s army"" will shake the political establishment in the upcoming general election. He said that the three main parties do not ""believe in Britain"" and that Ukip was the only party ""standing up for the little man."" It is his first speech of the campaign. What else did he have to say? This is the place that Nigel Farage hopes will go from Conservative blue to Ukip purple. He came here today, inside that cinema, to make a speech which was effectively a soft launch of his campaign. It was important - heavy on the rhetoric. It gave us a signal of how Ukip will fight this campaign. It will tug at the heart strings and go for the emotions. There was much mention of ""'believe""'. Believe in Britain, he said, believe in change. He thinks it will be a nasty campaign can the Tories and Labour going at him. He said Ukip will rise above However beastly the establishment is to me or to any of our candidates in winnable seats, however personal and nasty this campaign becomes, Ukip will rise above it. We will turn the other cheek. We will ignore their insults and we will get on, saying to the British people, we believe in Britain and we want yoUI’ vote because WE WSIâ1t Ci’13Iâ1gâ. Importantly though it was light on the weighty policy issues. I asked him what his deficit reduction plan was. That is at the heart of what politicians have at this election. They said it will come later. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Helen Willets. This time last year we had a red weather warning out for stormy weather. It is so quiet out there. There is more sunshine than yesterday. We are changing the weather script for tomorrow. That mass of cloud is this developing area of low pressure. That will bring us our first significant area of low pressure. That will bring us ourfirst significant rain and strong winds for some time. If it is the quiet life you like, make the most of the afternoon. One or two showers around, particularly in the far north of Scotland. Temperatures are a degree up on yesterday. They will not drop as low tonight because the winds will start to strengthen. There""ll be showers ahead of the main player across Wales and the south-west. Wintry, because it will be chilly in the north and east, with the potential for frost here. Some snow forfrost here. Some snow for a time. Strong winds and rain - not particularly nice across the roads of Northern Ireland first thing. As it comes into Dumfries and Galloway, a smattering of snow on the highest mountains. It should not last too long. Unpleasant across the south-Wales area. That driving rain across the south-west as well. Showers should be light. Nevertheless, another damp, grey start. Hill fog around. Strong winds will push that rain eastwards to all but the north of Scotland. Here we should do well with some sunshine. These showers following on behind - double figures at last. Hail and thunder and beefy showers will follow on. Through tomorrow night and into Saturday the low will diminish the intensity of the showers. It will pull away. Saturday leaves us with a lot of cloud. We are back to where we are right now - benign conditions - drizzle. Temperatures higher than we have been used to. On Saturday night into Sunday, where we see the cloud break, we will get fog, some frost again. This weather front all the time held at bay, except for the far south-west. Perhaps Northern Ireland and north-west Scotland. For many of us, on Sunday, the day does not look too bad. Useful weather, us, on Sunday, the day does not look too bad. Usefulweather, if too bad. Useful weather, if you want to get out and about. Temperatures are creeping up I will be cloudy. We will not see a great deal of sunshine over the weekend. It will be a little milder. We have that rain to contend with first thing tomorrow. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: The leaders of Russia and Ukraine announce a ceasefire beginning midnight Saturday - after fighting that’s already claimed thousands of lives. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Sonja jessup. A father whose son was killed in a cement mixer is preparing to sue Essex Police over serious mistakes they made during an investigation into his death. Les Balkwell’s son, Lee, from Rainham, was crushed as he tried to clean the mixer at a farm in 2002. Although an inquest found he’d been unlawfully killed, no-one’s been held responsible. Yvonne Hall has this report. For Les Balkwell, the pain of losing his son, Lee, is still raw. I live with it every night- every single night. Until we get some closure and justice I will live with it every night and I still do. This is Lee Balkwell at a friend’s wedding a few months before he died. The 33-year-old father from Rainham was crushed to death in a cement mixer on a farm in Essex in 2002. An inquest decided he was unlawfully killed, but nobody has been held responsible. His father believes he was murdered and it was covered up. He’s campaigned ever since against way Essex Police handled the investigation. A report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded the investigation had been seriously flawed. It found eight senior officers made 25 errors. Officers failed to secure evidence from witnesses, that the IPCC found no evidence of police corruption or a conspiracy. Now Les has won the right to sue Essex Police for failing to investigate his son’s death properly. It is not about money. It is about making these people, and making the public and the establishment of what’s gone on here. Essex Police force says it is not appropriate for it to comment on Les Balkwell’s legal action while it is still going on. Last month, in the High Court the force tried to argue that too much time had passed since Lee Balkwell’s death in 2002 and the action should be thrown out, but the court rejected that claim and told Mr Balkwell he had the legal right to go ahead and sue the police. Les cannot afford a barrister, so the 68-year-old from Hornchurch is preparing to take on Essex Police by himself at the High Court next month.

Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Inflation in the UK could turn negative in the next few months with prices falling, according to the Governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney said the downward trend was likely to be short-term - but also that wages would rise by double the rate they did last year. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is already at an all-time low of 0.5%. It sounds like good news, but as our economics editor Robert Peston reports, it could be a mixed blessing. A winter harvest, sugar beet, basic food that has been getting cheaper. And along with the fall in oil and energy prices, it is tried in inflation down to nothing which affects all of us, especially farmers. At the moment, we are seeing global prices falling due to oversupply and two consecutive really big global harvests. Wheat prices have come down 25% from where they were last year and they are now just below the cost of production. On the plus side, fuel prices have dropped significantly over the last six months. The Bank of England expects inflation to be a big fat zero for most of this year, and indeed for prices to actually fall for a period. The cause is the drop in the price of energy, oil and food which should make us feel richer because we have to buy that stuff. The Bank of England thinks that if we feel richer, we will spend more. So what does the governor, Mark Carney think this record low inflation means for our prosperity and prospects? The combination of rising wages and falling energy and food prices will help household finances and boost the growth of real take-home pay this year to its fastest rate in a decade. This will support solid growth in consumer spending. The bank thinks inflation will be back to its 2% target by the middle of 2017, but it says there is a risk that price wars could become more widespread, that deflation could become serious and persistent. That would hobble the economy because we would boost bone spending to buy cheaper tomorrow. Across the world, we are in deep the evolutionary times, in particular, a very major downturn in the Chinese economy occurring which is one of the reasons why energy prices around the world have come down. I think the Eurozone is in danger of being in quite a severe deflation trap. The specific chance that in the UK, we have sustained negative inflation is relatively low. But I think these are headwinds against our rate of growth. If you were to judge that good price falls were turning into finishes deflation, what would you do about it? If we were in a situation, which we are not in, but if we ever were in a situation where we needed to provide additional stimulus, we have many options. We have many options to provide stimulus. And the effectiveness of that stimulus is reinforced by the relative health of the financial system. In other words, relative health of the financial system. In otherwords, interest rates including mortgages could be cut even from their current record low, although the bank’s expectation at the moment is that they will rise a bit, probably next year. This stuff gets turned into sugar, which is a bit like deflation. The right amount makes life sweeter but too much and we could end up in hospital, economic is speaking. -- economically speaking. And Robert’s with me now. Going into deflation is uncharted territory but should we be worried? It is being driven by two important in, oil prices collapse which is cutting fuel and energy prices and food prices are weaker. At the moment, it increases our spending power because we have to buy those things and so we have more money to spend on other goods and services. But they reflect a weakness in the global economy. China is slowing down, the Eurozone is in a mess and so is japan. down, the Eurozone is in a mess and so isjapan. It so is japan. It is possible that actually the price falls will go more widely and we will get into a period of genuinely worrying deflation. Right now, the Bank of England does not think that is likely but the governor of the Bank of England said they had to be alert to that risk, and he also said that they do have the tools to deal with it, should it happen. They could cut the official interest rates to zero or even turn it negative. They could create a lot more money. There are things that can be done about it but the one thing to focus on is that this is extraordinary. In our lifetime, the problem has normally been inflation and the fact we have the opposite is remarkable. Thank you forjoining us. An agreement to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine has been reached. The Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart announced a cease-fire - beginning this Saturday. The deal includes the withdrawal of weapons and the exchange of prisoners. But a previous cease-fire in the east didn’t hold, and a number of key issues still remain unresolved. The talks took place in Belarus. From Minsk, our chief international correspondent Lyse Douset reports. A brutal war on Europe’s doorstep. In ten months, it has killed nearly 5500 people, forced more than 1 million from their homes. Now a new deal to try to end the carnage has been agreed. The summit started here last night and started badly. The Presidents of Ukraine and Russia could barely look each other in the eye. They ended up negotiating for nearly 17 hours. The images that emerged underlying the deep divide that brought the talks close to collapse. But somehow, the deal was done. TRANSLATION: We now have a glimmer of hope. We have agreed on a comprehensive implementation of the Minsk agreement. But of course, concrete steps have to be made. We will be facing big hurdles. But on balance, I can say that what we have achieved today gives us more hope than if we had not achieved anything at all. This new agreement to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine includes a cease-fire, starting Saturday night British time. The withdrawal of heavy weapons, and importantly, the release of prisoners. It also mentions constitutional reform, to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy. Never had the Russian leader negotiated so long. When he emerged, he admitted it was not the best night of his life. And yet, a lot of hard bargaining still lies ahead. TRANSLATION: We have issues concerning border problems and an agreement with the separatists and the militia, humanitarian issues. The talks in Minsk were exceptionally tough. That is because they are notjust about a major war in Ukraine, as hard as that is. There is another significant political battle at play here, as the nations of Europe and Russia struggle to defend their competing strategic interests in the most sensitive of regions. In eastern Ukraine, this deal will be tested. In recent weeks, Russian backed separatists gained more ground and more confidence. But it is still not clear where the line will be drawn between their territory and Ukrainian government’s and whether it will still be drawn in blood. ""Everyone avoids tax"". That was the view of a former Tory Treasurer today - as he backed away from suing Ed Miliband over sharp criticism from the Labour leader. Lord Fink admitted using what he called ""vanilla measures"" to reduce his tax. But Mr Miliband stressed he wasn’t referring to him when he spoke about ""dodgy donors"" - as our political editor Nick Robinson reports. Does EVE I’yoI’Iâ EFIQBQE Does âVâI’yoI’Iâ EFIQBQE iI’I Does everyone engage in tax avoidance? Or is it dodgy to play as "" PHY avoidance? Or is it dodgy to play as -- pay as little as you can? That is what lies at the heart of the battle between the Labour leader and the former Tory treasurer, between the Labour leader and the formerTory treasurer, Lord Fink. It began with the revelation that one of those secretive Swiss HSBC accounts belonged to a man who has given the Tories £3 million. Yesterday, a Conservative donor, Lord Fink challenged me to stand by what I said in the House of Commons that he was engaging in tax avoidance activities. I do. What you have just seen and heard could have landed Ed Miliband in court. After all, that is what Lord Fink threatened just 24 hours ago. I challenge Ed Miliband to either repeat his allegations outside the House of Commons, or perhaps withdraw them publicly. But this morning, the Tory peer made a spectacular U-turn, saying he did not want to sue Ed Miliband and then telling London’s Evening Standard that everybody does tax avoidance at some level, before adding, ""what I did was at the vanilla, bland end of the spectrum"". Ed Miliband has long been itching to pick a fight with the Tories Verza rich supporters. Let’s ta ke Stanley Let’s take Stanley Fink. The Labour leader did not stop at accusing Lord Fink of avoiding tax. He went much further. You can’t get away from it. He is a dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors. This morning, labour’s education spokesman was asked again and again if his leader would repeat that attack as well. Ed Miliband will repeat his assertion that there is a pattern of behaviour... It looks like tax avoidance. It could well be described as dodgy. Four hours later, Mr Miller band was not at all clean on repeating -- later, Mr Miller band was not at all clean on repeating -- keen on repeating the word he used yesterday. The next sentence after talking about tax avoidance, you referred to dodgy Tory donors. Are you saying that Lord Fink is dodgy? The answer, it seems is known. I made a general comment about dodgy donors in the Conservative Party and I totally stand by it. I’m not saying it about Lord Fink. He also denied that his party’s biggest donation had avoided tax, even though the man who made it says he did. When David Cameron arrived at an EU summit in Brussels today, you are challenged to back his former treasurer. Is tax avoidance normal, Mr Cameron? Mrthink said it treasurer. Is tax avoidance normal, Mr Cameron? Mr think said it was. Mr Cameron? Mrthink said it was. No surprise, perhaps, that he did not seem overly keen to do it. Ed Miliband has been looking for a moment to demonstrate that he is, in his own phrase, on your side, whilst the Tories on the side of the rich. He sees this as rather like the moment when he challenged Rupert Murdoch after the revelation that the murdered teenager Milly Dowler’s phone had been hacked. Nick Robinson, BBC News Westminster. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories. A former paediatrician who raped and sexually assaulted girls during the 1970s and 80s has been sentenced to 18 years in jail. Michael Salmon, who’s now 80, committed most of the offences at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire. His crimes coincided with those of jimmy Savile at the same hospital, but they weren’t connected. A court in Egypt has ordered the release on bail of two Aljazeera journalists - Baher Mohamed and Mohammed Fahmy. They had been held for more than a year over allegations of aiding a terrorist organisation. Their colleague, the Australian Peter Greste was freed earlier this month. All strenuously denied the claims against them. A teenager accused of planning to behead a British soldier has told a court he only expressed extremist views to ""fit in"" with a Muslim group. Brusthom Ziamani said he fell in with members of al-Muhajiroun - an extremist organisation - after he was ""kicked out"" of home for converting to Islam. For the first time, guidance is being issued on the use of hidden cameras to monitor the care of people in hospitals and care homes in England. The regulator, the Care Quality Commission has produced a pamphlet that sets out what worried relatives need to consider. Care home owners say they fear it will undermine the trust between families and care workers. Here’s our social affairs correspondent, Alison Holt. 321 times, Yvonne Grant called out for someone to help her. Unable to walk, she needed help to get to the toilet. But at this care home, it was two and a half hours before anyone took her. Her family put a secret camera into their late grandmother’s room when they felt no one was listening to their concerns. We did not expect to see what we did, the extent of it. It was just horrified shock. Vanessa Evans welcomes today’s guidance on the use of hidden cameras to monitor care. Her grandmother’s care home acted quickly once it was presented with the footage. Her advice to other worried families is clear. Don’t be afraid to do it. It is heartbreaking, what comes out of it, but don’t let your relatives go through it. If there’s any kind of doubt, check it out. The guidance from England’s care regulator, the Care Quality Commission warns that using a hidden camera is a big step. It says recording equipment should only be used in a private room and only if it is in the best interests or with the consent of the person receiving care. The COC says it will examine any concerns raised. If providers are providing services which are safe and caring and high-quality, that are effective and responding to people’s needs, people won’t need to use cameras. They will have confidence in the care that they or their loved one is receiving. Hidden camera, here. At this London spy shop, they are seeing a growing number of people buying hidden cameras to check on a relative’s care. With it increasingly easy for people to get hold of tiny hidden cameras, today’s guidance from the COC aims to encourage people to think about issues of dignity and privacy before they take that step. Massively disappointing to think that people felt they needed to do that. At this meeting of care home owners, many hope families would feel able to talk to them before taking such a drastic step. They say what is needed is better staff training and funding of care. I’m disappointed they are going down this path, which creates a mistrust and an almost sinister perspective on where we are going with surveillance in care homes. For families and those providing the care, the priority is finding ways of ensuring that anyone who is older or vulnerable gets the best possible care. And you can find out more about care and how the system works by going to bbc.co.uk/care Our top story this evening. Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, could turn negative by the spring. That’s according to the Governor of the Bank of England. And still to come: Later on BBC London: Could you be brainwashed into lowering your energy bills? One London Housing Association thinks you can. And as the cricket World cup gets underway, we speak to the Middlesex team-mates of England skipper Eoin Morgan. From today, anyone posting intimate pictures of former partners on the internet will be committing a criminal offence. It’s thought the number of people engaged in so-called ""revenge porn"" has risen sharply with the widespread use of smartphones and digital cameras. Now perpetrators will go to jail for up to two years, as Rick Kelsey of BBC Radio One Newsbeat reports, from Chelmsford. They’re private pictures for partners only. They take seconds to upload but can cause years of misery and are almost impossible to remove from the Internet. Hazel Higgleton had no warning when her boyfriend posted an intimate video online. We saw pages and pages and pages on Google of, like, my name in capital letters on all these porn sites, and we clicked on it and I literally couldn’t watch it. I saw about five seconds of the video. I knew what it was, obviously. And Ijust couldn’t look at it. It was horrendous for me. Until now, cases like Hazel’s have been an illegal grey area. Police have used existing laws on offences such as harassment but now it’s a specific crime. As the way we take images has changed, so has the way we share them. Over the past few years there’s been an explosion of revenge porn due to the impact of new technology. But figures suggest very few cases have resulted in charges. The hope for the victims is that that will now change. And locals here are convinced that change could mean putting many more on the wrong side of the law. A mate sent it to his ex and they’ve just have had a nasty break-up and they have stuck it on Facebook, Twitter, everything. I still think people are going to do it, just to try and get revenge back because if it’s a long-term relationship they’re going to want to get revenge, so... I don’t know. Hopefully it stops but I don’t think it will, to be honest. And if it doesn’t, some legal experts see trouble ahead. The problem with this new law is that it will not resolve something which is ultimately a social problem, not a legal problem, and it’s also likely that it will result in prosecuting everyone who engages in this sort of conduct. The new law will be in force within weeks. For some like Hazel, the damage is already done. But she’s hoping that others will now be protected. Labour has promised to increase spending on education in England by at least the rate of inflation if it gets into power. It comes after the Conservatives said last week that they’d protect the schools budget in cash terms. Today, Ed Miliband said he’d go further, protecting the budget for schools, early years, and education for the over 16s. Alex Forsyth reports. The number of pupils in England’s schools is on the rise. It’s down to a spike in the birth rate and immigration. The question is how to accommodate these extra children and how to pay for their education. At this North London primary school, things are already tight. We’ve never got enough. We could always do with more. And with more money we could enrich the learning experience for our children. But it really is important that levels are maintained. Today, Ed Miliband set out Labour’s vision for education, saying he would cap class sizes, drive up standards and protect Department for Education’s spending. The next Labour government will protect the overall education budget - rising budgets, protected in real terms every year, not cut as they will be under the Conservatives. Labour says it will protect the education budget in line with inflation. That’s all children aged from birth up to 19. The whole pot is protected. Spending on each pupil, however, isn’t. It’s not clear the impact rising pupil numbers will have. Conservatives will allocate money to each pupil but they will only protect funding in cash terms, not in line with inflation, which may rise or, as we’ve heard today, fall. And their pledge is only for children aged five to 16, so early years and post-16 funding is vulnerable. Our policies take into account the increasing numbers of pupils going into schools. Parents can be sure that the money that follows the people will stay the same over the next four years and as the pupil numbers increase come so the funding going into schools increases. Meanwhile, at a school in Oxfordshire, the Lib Dems painted a picture of their education policy. Like Labour, they will protect spending from cradle to college and for the most deprived pupils. According to their manifesto from Page, education is a priority. We will protect not only the schools budget in real terms but funding for early years and colleges, too. We will make sure that every child is taught by a qualified teacher. We will triple the extra funding that goes to children from the poorest backgrounds in nursery. So for pupils and their parents, the office of three political parties on the table. ~ -- the offers. But when it comes to the maths, the question remains - if you protect spending on schools, what will be cut to pay for it? It’s one of the biggest and most prestigious arts institutions in the country, with a history dating back over 80 years. But The English National Opera’s immediate future has been thrown into doubt by the Arts Council of England, who’ve ejected it from its group of elite organisations. It’s asked the ENO to make improvements or face sharp cuts in its funding. Our arts editor Will Gompertz is at the English National Opera House in Central London for us this evening. Will, what’s gone wrong? Well, quite a lot. They have lost their Chief Executive and chairman and now they have this dictum coming down from the Arts Council in England saying their funding will be cut altogether unless they turn their situation around. That would be extraordinary. This is a major national arts institution with a history which goes back over 80 years. It was set up to provide popular operatic performances for the public which it has done and still does to an extent. It also produces really avant-garde and challenging new productions by unknown directors and there is a sense that that has lost their core audience, and when you are running a place as big and expensive as the Coliseum here in London that is a real problem. So it is a matter of how they balance the books. They need to find a solution really, really quickly. Otherwise I will be standing here telling you not about the latest production, but telling you that one of the biggest arts institutions in this country is now finished. Fifty Shades of Grey the film has its UK premier tonight and, as they say, is coming to a cinema near you. It’s already generating a lot of interest among film-goers despite a mixed reception from the critics. And, as David Sillito reports, from Wellington in Somerset, some unlikely enthusiasts have been inspired to put their enthusiasm in writing. There is some flash photography in this report. The glitz, the glamour. Emotions have been running high. This, the premier for the film of that book. Fifty Shades Of Grey. I think everyone is going to be really pleasantly surprised. It is funny and sexy. It’s behind the store. What is? My playroom... It is perhaps best if we leave it there. Here in Wellington in Somerset, even the local women’s Institute film group will be queueing. Millions have read it. It has also inspired one group of women to have a go for themselves. A bit of creative writing. Which has caused a bit of a stir. You must be Bridget? Iam! Welcome! It wasn’t very Telegraph, was it? They met through the Women’s Institute and the reaction to the group’s experiment in erotica has caused something of a stir. We’ve had responses from all over the world, actually. America, Ireland, also is of places! Did you expect this? To be honest, no! I don’t think any of us did. But reading and in -- think any of us did. But reading and in -- being inspired by Fifty Shades doesn’t mean they liked it. It is all for! It was inspiring to show others could do better, or certainly we could do better. So with orders around the world and a third print run, who wrote the erotic story in this collection? That is something you will neverfind this collection? That is something you will never find out! You are never going to tell us? A slightly saucy experiment, then, that will remain a secret. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Sarah Keith Lucas. Well, there have been 50 shades of 9""âY Well, there have been 50 shades of grey in the clouds today! Some sunshine on offer as well. In Aberdeenshire we saw the brakes on the cloud with temperatures up to 11 degrees or so, but underneath that, temperatures more like three or A degrees. So we end the day on a bit of a gloomy note but the wind is picking up from the West with some showery rain pushing in, and with a weather front which pushes in tomorrow. Some mist and fog around and even a few pockets of frost first thing Friday morning, but by 8am, the rain will be quite persistent across parts of Northern Ireland and knocking on the door of south-west Scotland. Some very wintry showers across the hills of Scotland. The Grampians, parts of Dumfries & Galloway. Snow on the highs tells and over Cumbria possibly some wintry feel to those showers. -- possibly some wintry feel to those showers. -- snow on the high heels. The main bulk of rain and wind pushes west to east across much of the country. Some bright spells across parts of Northern Ireland and towards the south-west of England with temperaturesjust towards the south-west of England with temperatures just about in double figures. The North of Scotland having the best of the weather there. The weather front will gradually move south and east as we move to the weekend so Saturday starts with some cloud, mist and fog. Through the day, again, some showers the central and eastern areas. Probably the best of the sunshine further west with highs of 7 degrees up to 9 degrees. A similar day on Sunday. Fairly cloudy and reasonably mild with further rain pushing in later on on Sunday.

The Mayor has said he’ll ask Scotland Yard to see if issuing radiation devices to police officers could help in the fight against terrorism. Boris johnson was speaking after a meeting with New York police chief Bill Bratton, who explained how the devices help them search for weapons. In a moment we will be speaking to an expert in terrorism and risk about the threat to London. But first this report from our political correspondent Karl Mercer. You wouldn’t know it to look at them but thousands of New York police cars and officers are mobile radiation detectors. This one fits on the belt and a significant number of our officers carry it. The city has spent millions of dollars on devices like these. Bill Bratton is keen to show them off as a weapon against the terrorist dirty bomb. It might be beyond the capability of the existing terrorist networks in the world at the moment but it is something, as we have watched the evolution of terrorism and the creativity and the desire to obtain this type of capability, it is something that we are preparing for. On any given day we have these devices hit very frequently because we have any number of people who, because they have had radiation in terms of dealing with cancer, it is that sensitive that they can pick up that type of dose. The device is just one tool that New York is using and London is learning about. The mayor is riding the subway with the Big Apple’s police chief. At one stage it was thought Bill Bratton could be brought over to London as a Police Commissioner but it will not be happening but some of his ideas could cross the pond. Are you saying that you will consider a similar system in London? I think what we need to do is get a better understanding of the risks versus the investment and I think what I am thinking of doing is going back to Bernard and to the Metropolitan Police and to try and evaluate what we think the likelihood is of a dirty bomb or an attack of that kind. New York may have the latest gadgets but even its police chief warned that London is facing a much bigger terrorist problem. It is a much more real threat for you, England, and the rest of Europe. Boris talked about the fact that the British police services have hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals of concern, persons of interest is the term that I would use. We have nothing approaching that here in New York City, in the United States at the moment. The two men say they will continue talking and our mayor will have to talk to his own chief of police.

They were a very early Al-Qaeda threat which is why New York really geared UP which is why New York really geared up for it and they have put billions into those systems. We run by a thread. The police in the UK may well say that if they have to go into any contaminated area it is very good for them then to have a radiation detector and to have some training in how to detect radiation, with that or other types of equipment, but it is really to give the police some security that they are not taking radiation home to theirfamilies if they are not taking radiation home to their families if they are in an incident. Are you saying we should be more concerned perhaps the threat of people coming back from Syria or using conventional terrorism methods like the rucksack suicide bombings that we saw on 7/7? Even the terrorists have learned and they learned it years ago, that it is an inefficient weapon. The use of radiation compared to explosives or sharp knives, itjust doesn’t have the effect on people. People can have a good wash down and go away and be quite OK but explosives have a terminal point. It is interesting because with the quite high profile case of the poisoning of Alexander littering Inco it will make people worry about the threat of radiation. It is very specifically because my experience with him is that some police who went to that house were contaminated and they were very worried about it. It is notjust them, it is taking the radiation home to theirfamilies them, it is taking the radiation home to their families so if you have equipment they can put on and, quite frankly Britain has loads of this type of mechanism anyway, we have got experts and we are way ahead of the rest of the world and actually it is not a worry in this country. Perhaps spending or investment in any radiation in -- detectors, you would have concerns about. If you were in charge of the police budget, what would your priority be? The priority would be to really protect the police with as much body equipment and training as possible so that they, as the front line, do not become the victims, and they are the intended victims of the current terrorist threat. What sort of things do you mean? It means in their clothing, we are looking at knives, and the way in which they are co-ordinated so that intelligence gets to them very quickly. OK, we must leave it there. Thank you. Coming up later in the programme: Could you be brainwashed into lowering your energy bills? One London Housing Association thinks you can. The trial of Brusthom Ziamani, who is accused of planning to behead a British soldier, has been hearing from the defence. Police arrested Mr Ziamani in east London in August last year. He denies preparing an act of terrorism. Richard Lister reports from the Old Bailey. Brusthom Ziamani spent much of the day in court explaining his association with supporters of a banned Islamic extremist organisation. He said that his parents are devout jehovah’s Witnesses and when they discovered he was converting to Islam he told the court that they threw him out of the house. He sought refuge at Camberwell Mosque and it was there that he met supporters of this group who took him in and gave him clothes and shelter. He said he wanted to fit in with them because, he said, I had no one and if I did not have them I would be back on the streets. He did acknowledge posting extremist statements on Facebook, including questioning, in his words, why people made such a big deal about the murder of Lee Rigby. He told the court that he did not disagree with that murder but he insisted he did not have any plans himself to carry out anything like that in the UK. He said it was not something that we would do himself. We expect him to continue giving evidence tomorrow. It’s official, rail regulators say the Christmas engineering work led to unacceptable service levels.

The question is, what will be done to make sure it can’t happen again? Our reporter Katharine Carpenter is at King’s Cross station for us now. Katharine. Well, just take a look at how busy this station is this evening. For a holdout on the Saturday after Christmas it had to shut because Network Rail engineering works overran. There were similar problems at Paddington and it is estimated that around 115,000 passengers were affected. Many of them were caught UP affected. Many of them were caught up in scenes like this at Finsbury Park which was being used as a back-up station but it simply could not cope as in the end it had to shut down for a short time, leaving passengers stranded. Network Rail released its report into all of this a while ago and today it was the turn of the rail regulator. It simply said that what happened at Christmas was unacceptable and it made a number of regulation -- recommendations about how to prevent it happening again. These included developing clear contingency plans which put passengers first and were better communicated to all involved. Network Rail have already been fined £14 million for causing similar delays in a previous festive period so I asked the network -- delays in a previous festive period so I asked the network -- the rail regulator later -- so I asked the network -- the rail regulator later -- the rail regulator White has not fined the company this time. Network Rail from the outside recommended the problems and the failings in what they have done at King’s Cross and they worked very openly with us and they accepted our recommendations and the need to implement them so on that basis we do not think it is appropriate to find them. Where does this leave future work? The next load due to take place at Easter. Network Rail says it will have contingency plans that are fit to purpose in place by then and it says it will have implemented all the recommendations the regulator made by Christmas. A father whose son was killed in a cement mixer is preparing to sue Essex Police over serious mistakes they made during an investigation into his death. Lee Balkwell was crushed as he tried to clean the mixer at a farm in 2002. Although an inquest found he’d been unlawfully killed, no one’s been held responsible. Yvonne Hall reports. For this man, the Forthis man, the pain son is still raw. I live with it every night, every single night, until we get closure and justice I will live with it every night and I still do. I am very proud to be his mates... This was Lee Balkwell at a wedding just a few months before he died. The 33-year-old father was crushed to death in this cement mixer at a crushed to death in this cement mixerat a farm mixer at a farm in Essex in 2002. An inquest decided he was unlawfully killed but nobody has been held responsible. His father believes it was a murderand it responsible. His father believes it was a murder and it was covered up. He has campaigned ever since about the way that Essex Police and it was covered up. He has campaigned ever since about the way that Essex Police handled. It found eight senior officers made 25 errors including failing to supply evidence from witnesses -- including failing to supply evidence from witnesses -- secure evidence from witnesses but they found no evidence of police corruption or conspiracy. Now he has won the right to sue the police for failing to investigate his son ‘s death properly. It is not about money, it is about making these people and making the public and the public antiestablishment aware of what has gone on you. Essex Police say it is not appropriate to comment on this legal action while it is still going on. Last month in the High Court the force tried to argue that too much time had passed since the death of Lee Balkwell in 2002 and the action should be thrown out. The court rejected that claim and told his father that he has the legal right to sue the police. He cannot afford a barrister so the 68-year-old from corn church is preparing to take on Essex Police by himself at the High Court next month. -- Essex Police by himself at the High Court next month. -- Hornchurch. Detectives investigating the murder of a student in south east London say someone dialled a number from his mobile phone minutes before he was stabbed. It’s exactly four years since Samuel Guidera, who was 24, was attacked and robbed in Sydenham. Police believe his killer may have pretended they wanted to use his phone. Although officers have spoken to almost 900 witnesses, no-one’s been convicted of Samuel’s murder. Essex Police have confirmed that a hand grenade found at Southend Hospital yesterday was a live device. Bomb disposal experts were brought in to examine the grenade. A cordon was in place around the hospital for three hours and parts of the building had to be evacuated. Police are urging anyone with information to contact them. Nigel Farage chose Canvey Island in Essex today to launch what he calls Ukip’s people’s army. He claims it’ll shake the political establishment in the upcoming general election because the three main parties do not believe in Britain, and that his party was the only one standing up for the little man. Our Political Editor Tim Donovan has more on this and joins us now. So Tim why Essex? Well, this was his first big set piece event. His first speech of the year. The reason he chose Essex is because they have such high hopes for this area. Before he made the speech he went for a walkabout in Canvey Island and went around a boat yard where they have high hopes of hanging on to Clacton and winning and doing well in Castle point and South Basildon and also in Thurrock where they have recently selected one of their senior officials, someone who was writing the manifesto. As you say, the overarching theme is one of standing UP overarching theme is one of standing up for the little man, the small man if you like. Giving them a voice against the establishment. Nigel Farage said he expected the campaign to be quite nasty and there would be a lot of mud slung. However beastly the establishment is to me or to any of our candidates, however personal or nasty this campaign becomes, Ukip will rise above it. We will turn the other cheek and ignore their insults and we will get so on, saying to the British people that we believe in Britain and we want your vote because we want change. So, that is Essex but what progress could they make in London? First off, Nigel Farage claims that Ukip was the only party that represented all parts of the United Kingdom. He said the Conservatives were confined to the south and Labour were concerned about their stronghold in the north. It skipped over an inconvenient truth about London where the record shows that they have not yet breached its battlements. It may be that their significance is more the indirect impact that they end up having and they started to show the kind of damage they could do to the Conservatives in the local elections last year where their results ensured that the Conservatives lost quite a few council seats and it is possible that conservative candidates in a marginal seats in the election are going to be vulnerable because of the vote for Ukip. Many thanks. Still to come tonight: Can Middlesex batsman Eoin Morgan lead England to victory in the Cricket World Cup? ~ I speak to his team-mates and get their good luck messages. And a hard act to follow, the drama school that taught these famous faces takes a new direction. The famous faces that he did not see there! Next, we’ve all heard the tips on how to lower our energy bills, turn down the heating, turn off our lights - all pretty much common sense. But do we do it? And the simple answer is that many of us don’t. So now a London Housing Association has come up with a way of helping us, and it’s all to do with mind over matter. Ayshea Bu ksh explains. Nicola is a single mum who lives with her four kids in Penge in south-east London. She increasingly gets massive gas and electricity bills. It is a constant worry when the bill will come in and for me thatis the bill will come in and for me that is more... It is easy to be blase and carry on with what you are doing but the reality when the bill comes in is like, oh, my God, you know, and that is when you think this is really hard now. Nicola rents her home from a housing association who have spent £2 million on a scheme that relies on the scientific art of persuasion. What people always tend to do is they think their house is insulated and there walls are insulated and the loft is insulated so why should be saving a huge amount but it doesn’t normally work that way. The energy assessor analyses Nicola’s bad habits and has installed some energise saving gadgets and like a personal trainer he keeps in touch with her to check she’s following his advice. If you are not aware of what you are using, even if your home is well insulated, you still will not be saving what you ought to be saving and that is part of the reason why we go out and let people know that you need this change as well. The scheme was devised by a company that uses behavioural psychology to get people to use less energy in their homes. Are you trying to brainwash people? It is a subconscious activity, you are right. It is a case that we do not like instilling new things in our lives so in a small way, yes, it is a way of making the change so small that you do not notice it and then slowly scaling up that change and making it easier for you to take on board. I am early in the programme andI board. I am early in the programme and I am still learning but when you see it in front of you it is a good thing for me and I can show it to the kids. You know, having kids, they do not have to worry about paying for the bill at the end of the day so it is really good to get them involved. While Nicola may be slowly changing her mind set it may take our children a little bit longer to turn their lights off. The BBC understands Chris Ramsey will be given the job of QPR manager until the end of the season. He’s been caretaker manager since the departure of Harry Redknapp and oversaw their victory at Sunderland on Tuesday that lifted them out of the Premier League relegation zone. He has never managed in the Premier League before. The Cricket World Cup starts this weekend with England facing co-hosts Australia. Middlesex batsman and England captain Eoin Morgan is looking to lead his side to an unlikely victory. The Aussie’s are favourites, having won 13 of their last one-day games Down Under. Sara Orchard has been to Lords today to see if Morgan’s Middlesex team mates think England can cause an upset. Whilst we were all eating our breakfast, the hot air was in full flow in New Zealand and Australia. Welcome to Melbourne and Australia, the sporting and major events capital of the world. We will argue the case were London on another day but this giant puppet represented the size of the task facing the cricketers from England who face the Aussies in their opening match. I think if we can produce what I believe is our best cricket on Saturday we can beat Australia. At Lord’s today the Middlesex team-mates were all anticipating the start of the tournament, but we did discuss the elephant in the room. Considered one of England’s most bankable limited over performers, there is no doubting that since being named captain last year Eoin Morgan’s form has dropped. He was out for a duck against Pakistani and he was third in his last four openings. He is not fazed by that. He is a playerfor the big occasion and I would always back in to score more runs in the World Cup than in a warm up game when there is no one at watching. We trust him explicitly here. We are all rooting for him because it is a hard job, captaining a team and keeping you informed. He has played in big tournaments all around the world and he has had a couple of low scores but obviously I look to cash in and get past ten or 20 balls. As Eoin Morgan hopes to cash in his mates are happy to sell out as I asked them to describe the absent batsmen. Pale, Irish and wristy. Gritty, fearless and is determined. How would you describe Eoin Morgan in three words? Irish, obviously, pale, freckly, and a damn fine batsmen. Not quite three words but there is respect behind the smiles are nothing but good wishes for Eoin Morgan and is England. From all of us, England the best of luck in the World Cup, you will smash up there. Go well. Absolutely, good luck. It’s the country’s oldest drama school and has trained the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, jim Broadbent and Patricia Hodge. Now, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, or LAMDA as it’s commonly known, is getting bigger, with a multi-million pound redevelopment, as Emilia Papadopoulos has been finding out. Today it isjust Today it is just a in the years to come some of the country’s biggest stars will learn their trade here. This year’s graduates perform a contemporary version of a Midsummer nights dream in hard hats and high vizjackets, of course, to mark the start of construction of the redevelopment. By the end of next year this I will be transformed into a new extension. Will have two letters and state-of-the-art training facilities. The school managed to raise £23 million for the project through private donations and fundraising and it now needs £5 million more. Today it asks the government for help, of course in the most theatrical way. We are the only drama school in this country that has had no central government help so far. It is fantastic, therefore, to see the secretary of state for DC MS here today. Thank you so much for coming. Now, maybe, you would just like to say whatever it is you would like to say. My left hand is always out there if you want to pass me the cheque! It is something we would take up. It is really important to see what is going on. LAMDA say the new facility, which will be joined on to its current campus, will allow them to train some of the best actors in the world. It is not hard to believe, Benedict Cumberbatch, jim Broadbent and Patricia Hodge are just some of its star in life. There are people who see the arts as some kind of a amusement, as something thatis kind of a amusement, as something that is peripheral to life and there are those who see it is fundamental to life and I do not think we can ever underestimate how fundamental the arts are. As the culture secretary put it today, this is not just about an investment in bricks and mortar but an investment in future talent. Time for a check on the weather with Helen Willetts. What have you got for us? Similar to what we just have their outside. At the moment it is a really boring and static weather system. just four Celsius today, cold. In the sunshine it makes a difference at this time of year and we saw 11 degrees in Aberdeen. We are going to change the weather script for tomorrow. We have been static for a few days but instead we are watching this loop or curl of cloud in the Atlantic. It will not necessarily bring sunshine but it will bring the first significant rain for some time. The lines are tightening up and we will have windy weather for some time. The wind will tend to lift and break the cloud up this evening and overnight. Temperatures will come close to freezing and as the wind picks up there will be splashes of rain and the forklifts onto the Downs to the south. It could be a bit on the grey side again tomorrow morning for the commute to work. A few splashes of rain before the main event comes in. That will be the second half of the day when it clears away and we will see sunshine later. The temperatures are higher. We have wind and rain tomorrow and then squally showers coming through the evening and they will be heavy with hail and Sunday at-- the evening and they will be heavy with hail and Sunday at -- thunder as this low migrates to the south. We are hoping it might lose the intensity as we move towards Saturday morning so hopefully at the weekend the showers will diminish through Saturday morning and become fewer through the day. Saturday is looking as though it will be dry for many of us but with a lot of cloud. Slightly milder than it has been. A similar, if not drier day on Sunday. It will then revert back to offering cloudy and then Sunday will stay dry but late on the day on Sunday and into Monday more rain is on the way. Thank you very much. The main headlines: The Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney says inflation will stay low and could turn negative this spring. He says interest rates could be cut further if it persists longer. A ceasefire in Ukraine is to begin at midnight on Saturday after a peace deal was agreed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. German chancellor Angela Merkel calls it a glimmer of hope. Labour has promised to increase spending on education in England at least in line with inflation. Ed Miliband says his party will also cap school class sizes at 30 pupils if they win the general election in May. Borisjohnson has said he’ll ask Scotland Yard to see if issuing radiation devices to police officers could help in the fight against terrorism. The Mayor was speaking after meeting New York police chief Bill Bratton. And rail regulators say the Christmas engineering work led to unacceptable service levels at Kings Cross, Paddington and Finsbury Park stations. Network Rail has been warned that scenes like these can’t be repeated. That’s it for now. We’ll be back later during the ten o’clock news. And plenty, of course, on our website.

85,BBC1 London,12-feb-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten: A peace deal in eastern Ukraine - the ceasefire will start in A8 hours. The talks, hosted by Belarus, and involving Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine, lasted over 16 hours - but important issues remain to be settled. We’ll be reporting from eastern Ukraine on reaction to the ceasefire deal- and what it means on the ground. Under the details of this peace deal, all heavy weaponry - which we’ve just heard being used in the last few minutes - will have to be withdrawn. We’ll also have reaction from Moscow, and we’ll be asking who gains most from the terms of the deal. Also tonight: Britain is heading for its first period of falling prices since current records began in 1989. We speak to the man who says he alerted Nigel Farage launches UKIP’s election campiagn - and sets out his terms for supporting a minority government. And remembering the bombing of Dresden 70 years ago, in which 25,000 people were killed. Later on BBC London: Network Rail escape a multi-million pound fine following the chaotic scenes faced by passengers over Christmas. And coming to the capital- the Mayor visits one of the world’s most famous museums in Washington. Good evening. A peace deal to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine has been agreed after more than 16 hours of talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. Chancellor Merkel said the agreement offered ""a glimmer of hope, no more, no less"". The ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels will begin at midnight on Saturday. The two sides will withdraw their troops and heavy weapons behind an agreed ""separation line"", with a demilitarized buffer zone to keep the forces apart. Our correspondent Ian Pannell is in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk and sent this report. It’s an image more in keeping with the last century than this one. But this was today, on the fringes of modern Europe. These men fight for the Ukrainian government. Battling to hold ground against an uprising in the east of the country. And these young recruits are training to fight them. The rebels reject the rule of the government in Kiev. They reject its plans to join the EU. Instead, they look east to Russia and want more powers for this region. The battle has brought devastation to Ukraine’s economic heartland. More than 5000 people have been killed. 1.5 million uprooted. But while we were filming news came through that a peace deal hasjust been signed. TRANSLATION: I hope there’s a cease-fire but maybe it won’t last forever, like before. People will be able to rebuild their homes, buy shopping, buy food and somehow start living again. What will happen in the future, I don’t know, I can’t say the war will be over. The peace deal has been brokered by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine. Desperate to stop a conflict that threatens regional chaos. TRANSLATION: We now have a glimmer of hope. We have agreed on the comprehensive intimidation of the Minsk agreement, but concrete steps have to be made and we will be facing big hurdles. But on balance I can say that what we have achieved today gives us more hope than if we haven’t achieved anything at all. The brief grip but no grim, as the Russian and Ukrainian presidents met. Kiev has accused Moscow of sending troops and weapons to help the rebels, an allegation Russia denies. Even so, this agreement noticeably deals with the role of outsiders. TRANSLATION: All foreign troops will pull out from Ukraine’s territory. Mercenaries from Ukraine’s territory, they should be withdrawn as soon as possible. TRANSLATION: It wasn’t the best night of my life, but it has been a good morning because we have managed to reach a major agreement. On Saturday night the guns are supposed to fall silent. The political process starts after that. Perhaps most importantly this deal should mean an end to the killing. This is the forward most position for rebel troops. Ukrainian forces are a few hundred metres down that road. Under the details of this peace deal, all heavy weaponry which we’ve just heard being used in the last few minutes, will have to be withdrawn. But both sides have been here before. And with so many lives lost, positions have only hardened. So restoring peace to the streets of Eastern Ukraine isn’t guaranteed. Our diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall is in Moscow. What is the view on who has gained the upper hand in these negotiations? Well, you saw President Putin looking pretty pleased as he came out of the negotiations. You could say that Russia has the upper hand. The Ukrainian president has admitted he didn’t get all he came for. He wanted an immediate cease-fire. It’s not going to happen for two days. He wanted foreign troops out of the country. It’s in the text, but will President Putin take any notice of it, when he denies Russian troops are there? The Ukrainians want control back over their Russian border to stop the heavy weaponry coming in, but it is not supposed to take effect until the end of this year. However, if this plan were to work in the longer term it could work to Ukraine’s advantage. It would mean the end of fighting and the reassertion of Kiev control over this region. Even the Russians are saying they want the Ukraine reintegrate these regions into the country economically. If the guns go silent, maybe Russia’s grip would slip away. The deal is fragile. David Cameron was saying what is on paper is all very well, we have to see if it is implement it. We have been here before, the accord last Septemberfailed. What might been here before, the accord last September failed. What might this Septemberfailed. What might this -- what might make this work? Everyone is so scared what might happen if it doesn’t. People are saying this is the last chance for peace. 5000 people killed already, many thousands have lost their homes. The fighting in the region could escalate out of control and it could lead to a confrontation between Russia and the West. If the United States decided to arm Ukraine, we could have a hot war between the United States and Russia and nobody, not even in Moscow, wants to contemplate that. Britain is heading for its first period of falling prices since current records began in 1989, and interest rates, which are already at a record low level, might have to be reduced further. The inflation forecast was presented by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who insisted that there was no danger of the economy falling into a dangerous spiral of deflation. Our economics editor Robert Peston explains. A winter harvest, sugar beets, basic food that’s been getting cheaper and along with the fall in oil and energy prices that’s driving inflation down to nothing which affects all of us - and especially farmers. So at the moment we’re seeing global prices that have fallen due to oversupply. We’ve seen two consecutive really big global harvests, so wheat prices have come down 25% from where they were last year and theyre nowjust below the cost of production. On the plus side we’ve seen fuel prices have dropped significantly over the last six months. The Bank of England expects inflation to be a big fat zero for most of this year and indeed for prices to actually fall for a period. Now the big cause is the drop in the price of energy, oil and food, which should make us feel richer because we have to buy that stuff and the Bank of England thinks that if we feel richer we’ll spend more. So what does the Governor Mark Carney think this record low inflation means for our prosperity and prospects? The combination of rising wages and falling energy and food prices will help household finances and boost the growth of real take-home pay this year to its fastest rate in a decade. This will support solid growth in consumer spending. The bank thinks inflation will be back to its 2% target by the middle of 2017, but it says there is a risk that price falls could become more widespread, that deflation could become serious and persistent. That would hobble the economy, because we would postpone spending to buy cheaper tomorrow. Across the world we are in deep deflationary times and particularly there’s a major downturn in the Chinese economy now occurring, which actually is one of the reasons why energy prices around the world have gone down. I think the eurozone is in danger of being in quite a severe deflationary trap and I think the specific chances in the UK we have sustained negative inflation, I think that’s relatively low. But I do think these are headwinds against our rate of growth. If you were to judge that good price falls were turning into pernicious deflation, what would you then do about it? If we were a situation - which we are not in at the moment- but if we ever were in a situation where we needed to provide additional stimulus, we have many options. We have many options to provide that stimulus and the effectiveness of the stimulus is reinforced by the relative health of the financial system. In other words, interest rates including mortgages could be cut even from their current record lows, though the bank’s expectation at the moment is that they’ll rise a bit, probably next year. This stuff gets turned into sugar, which is a bit like deflation. The right amount makes life sweeter, too much and we could end up in hospital, economically speaking. The former Conservative Treasurer Lord Fink has suggested that tax avoidance is widespread in British society and he’s admitted taking action to reduce his own tax liabilities. Ed Miliband immediately accused the peer of an ""extraordinary U-turn"". The Labour leader had been threatened with legal action by Lord Fink yesterday, following his comments about ""dodgy donors to the Conservative Party"". Mr Miliband said today he had not been talking about Lord Fink. Our political editor Nick Robinson has the story. Does everyone engage in tax avoidance, or is it dodgy to pay as little as you can? That’s what lies at the heart of the battle between the Labour leader and the former Tory treasurer, Lord Fink. It began with the revelation that one of those secretive Swiss HSBC accounts belonged to a man who has given the Tories £3 million. Now yesterday, a Conservative donor, Lord Fink, challenged me to stand by what I said in the House of Commons, that he was engaging in tax avoidance activities. I do. What you have just seen and heard could have landed Ed Miliband in court because MPs can say what they like in the Commons without being sued, but Lord Fink threatened legal action just 24 hours ago. I challenge Ed Miliband to either repeat his allegations outside the House of Commons, or perhaps to withdraw them publicly. But this morning the Tory peer made a spectacular U-turn, saying, ""I don’t want to sue Ed Miliband,"" and then telling London’s Evening Standard, ""Everyone does tax avoidance at some level."" Before adding, ""What I did was that the vanilla, bland, end of the spectrum."" Lord Fink says he was paid into a Swiss bank account when he lived and worked in the country, and set up what he called simple family trusts for his wife and children. Ed Miliband has long been itching to pick a fight with the Tory’s rich supporters. Let’s take Stanley Fink... The Labour leader did not stop at accusing Lord Fink of avoiding tax - he went much further. He can’t get away from it. He’s a dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors. This morning, Labour’s education spokesman was asked again and again if his leader would repeat that attack as well. Ed Miliband will be repeating his assertion today... That he is dodgy? That there is a pattern of behaviour that looks like tax avoidance. It could well be described as dodgy. just four hours later, Mr Miliband wasn’t at all keen on repeating the D word he used yesterday. The next sentence, after talking about tax avoidance, you referred to dodgy Tory donors. Are you saying that Lord Fink is dodgy? The answer, it seems, is no. I used a general comment about dodgy donors in the Conservative Party and I totally stand by that comment. I’m not saying it about Lord Fink. Lord Fink issued a statement claiming that was a major climb-down, by a man willing to smear without getting his facts straight. When the man who gave him his peerage arrived at an EU summit in Brussels, he was challenged to back his former treasurer. Is tax avoidance normal, Mr Cameron? Mr Fink said it was. No surprise, perhaps, that he didn’t seem awfully keen to do it. Ed Miliband has seized on this week’s revelations about tax avoidance to present himself as being on your side and prepared to stand up to the rich and to the powerful. His aides say it’s just like the moment he chose to challenge Rupert Murdoch in the aftermath of another revelation - the revelation that the murdered teenager Milly Dowler’s phone had been hacked. The BBC has seen correspondence sent to the British tax authorities back in 2008 which gave details of HSBC account holders in Switzerland. The bank has been criticised for helping wealthy clients, including British citizens, to avoid or evade tax. The emails sent by Herve Falciani were obtained by Le Monde newspaper. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, met Mr Falciani in Paris this evening and sent this report. He is the man at the heart of the biggest league of private banking data in history. Herve Falciani now says that he feels vindicated after a seven-year campaign culminated in revelations this week over HSBC and tax evasion. It required seven years of struggle, of battles, to get to the point we are just now. Much of the HSBC controversy hangs on what Britain’s tax collectors knew and when. HMRC said that it had no record of eight 2008 e-mail that Mr Falciani said he sent revealing the HSP evidence. In Parliament yesterday, the head of HMRC was questioned about whether she knew about the e-mail. Were you offered the data in 20087 Not to my knowledge. Does anybody know if you were offered the data7 At tonight the French newspaper Le Monde published the e-mail. How does it make you feel? Great! You can ask me many times, it would be great, the same. And it proved that I am right. He said that HSBC should be prosecuted for its behaviour in 2005 and told the BBC that the issue of invasion went far wider in banking. In HSBC, it was natural, but it was dealing with many banks, hundreds of banks, so what is the HSBC case tomorrow? Tomorrow it can become the case of hundreds of banks. Not everyone is a fan of Herve Falciani, who has been accused of stealing data and demanding money. He denies both. What he does say is that he has paid a huge personal cost for bringing this information into the public domain. What personal cost has that been for you? Tremendous. Personal, of course professional is not even a question to mention. And also physical. The risk, the evident risk. But you know, more than that, the reputational one. HSBC says it has reformed, but it is now facing a Parliamentary inquiry. One person who would be more than happy to give evidence is Mr Falciani. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News, Paris. Chancellor Merkel of Germany says a compromise is possible with Greece, whose new government wants to renegotiate the terms of the country’s bailout. At an EU summit in Brussels, Mrs Merkel said that Germany was ready to reach a deal if the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. The new Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, shook hands with Mrs Merkel at the talks earlier. He said he was confident that a solution that respected all parties could be found.

Nigel Farage has launched Ukip’s general election campaign predicting that no party will secure a majority at Westminster on May the 7th. He said that Ukip would not prop up any government unless it offered an immediate referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. Mr Farage went on to claim that Ukip would be seen as the only truly national political party in the UK. Our deputy political editor james Landale reports. Movie time at Canvey on the Essex Riviera - popcorn and paparazzi, but the carpet was more purple than red. The star of the show was Nigel Farage, after weeks out of the limelight, making his premiere public appearance of the year. Fifty Shades Of Grey starts today! And his message today - he would never tie Ukip into coalition with another party and he would demand a high price before getting into bed with a minority government. It is absolutely impossible that Ukip in Westminster would help one or other of the parties if they did not have a credible programme for a referendum, a proper, full, free and fair referendum, conducted correctly and within the right timetable. Apart from an immediate EU referendum, what else would Ukip demand as a price for its support? I’ve made it clear that, post May the 7th, if we find ourselves in the right position, the absolutely key issue is the referendum. That doesn’t mean it would be the only one, but let’s not presuppose what negotiations might happen on May the 8th or afterwards. So what might those other demands be? Well, Ukip wants tighter immigration controls, £3 billion more spent on health, and some tuition fees to be scrapped. But they’ve yet to make it absolutely clear how the party would fund these and other policies, nor have they set out their plans to cut the deficit. But this lack of detail doesn’t seem to worry Ukip supporters. So why vote Ukip? Is it because of their policies, or because of their attitude? It’s their attitude, they’re positive, and it’s the policies, they want England to remain England. It’sjust a change, isn’t it? It’s somebody new. If you look at their whole manifesto, it’s got a lot of holes in it. Theyjust seem to have one idea, they’ve put that forward. The reason Nigel Farage can talk so openly about what may or may not happen after the election is notjust because the polls are suggesting there might be a hung parliament. It’s because he is confident that there will be what he calls a good number of Ukip MPs at Westminster after May. His opponents say that’s overconfidence and Ukip may win a few MPs at most, but Mr Farage has outperformed expectations in the past, and he’s hoping to do so again. james Landale, BBC News, Canvey Island. Labour has pledged to keep the education budget in England at least in line with inflation if the party wins the general election. He also said no child in the early years would be taught in a class of more than 30 for longer than a year. The Liberal Democrats said Labour’s plan would require reckless borrowing, as our education correspondent Alex Forsyth reports. The number of pupils in England’s schools is on the rise. The question is how to pay for their education. At this north London primary school, things are already tight. We’ve never got enough. We could always do more, and with more money, we could enrich the learning experience for our children. Today Ed Miliband said Labour would cut class sizes and focus on standards, but the big announcement was about spending. The next Labour government will protect the overall education budget, rising budgets, protected in real terms, every year- not cut, as they will be under the Conservatives. Labour’s promise is to protect the education budget in line with inflation, that is for all children from birth aged up to 19, but while the total budget is protected, spending on each pupil isn’t, so the impact of rising numbers is not clear. The Conservatives will allocate the money for each pupil, but they’ll only protect funding in cash terms, not in line with inflation, which may rise or, as we’ve heard today, fall, and their pledges only for schools. That’s children aged five to 16, so early years and post-16 funding is vulnerable. Teaching unions welcome Labour’s cradle-to-college funding pledge, which they see as more generous. But as the Tories were keen to point out, whether schools are better off will depend on future inflation and the impact of both immigration and the birth rate on pupil numbers. We will be protecting school funding on a cash per pupil basis, and as pupil numbers increase, so the funding going to schools will increase. But Labour have not taken that into account in the calculations they have made on public spending. Meanwhile, at a school in Oxfordshire, the Lib Dems painted a picture of their education policy. Like Labour, they’ll protect spending for all ages and for the most deprived pupils. We’ll protect not only the schools budget in real terms, but funding for early years and colleges too. We will make sure that every child is taught by a qualified teacher. We will triple the extra funding that goes to children from the poorest backgrounds in nursery. So the education offers of three political parties are on the table, but do the maths and the question remains - if you protect spending on schools, what will be cut to pay for it? Alex Forsyth, BBC News. Commemorations will take place in Germany tomorrow to mark the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Dresden. Tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the Allied bombing raids which created a firestorm that destroyed 13 square miles of the city. Today many of Dresden’s historic buildings have been restored, but questions are still asked about the scale and intensity of the attacks in the final stages of the war. This report by our special correspondent Fergal Keane includes some graphic detail of the effects of the bombing. BELL TOLLS Dresden is remembering a storm of fire. It came near the end of the most savage war humanity had known, a total war in which the Nazis deliberately murdered millions of civilians. By 1945, the Allied imperative was to end that war quickly, and German civilians would pay a heavy price. On the 13th and 14th of February, RAF and then American bombers attacked Dresden. Nearly 4,000 tonnes of explosives and incendiary devices created a vast firestorm. An estimated 25,000 people were killed. Anita and Nora were childhood friends in the city. Nora’s family survived, Anita’s were killed. TRANSLATION: My parents suffocated in the cellar, and out of the 14 people there, I was the only survivor. It was terrifying, at first I thought it was the end of the war, but when it didn’t stop, I believed it was the end of the world. On our streets, all I saw was rubble, rubble, rubble, burned houses, and people searching for loved ones. They had no belongings anymore, and the dead were everywhere. Dresden was known to be crowded with refugees fleeing the Soviet advance from the east. There were also thousands of slave labourers and prisoners of war, like Victor. Women carrying their kids or anything like that didn’t stand a chance. They was just wheeled straight up into the air. I’ve seen that, I’ve seen bodies burning in the air. I’ve seen people get stuck in rivers of tar which had melted. They tried to cross it and got stuck. And their bodies get so hot, so hot that they explode. I’ve seen all that. Dresden was one of Europe’s most beautiful cities and a Nazi stronghold and military production centre. The main aim of the bombing was to aid the Soviet advance by creating chaos on the ground. The crews of Bomber Command felt the raids would help end the war against an evil enemy. When we looked down, we could see the huge blazes down there, and we realised it was a big fire, but we didn’t realise it was going to be as big as what happened eventually. Did you ever feel guilty after the war about what had happened at Dresden? No, not really. I think because we was very young, and we lost so many boys ourself. The dead of Dresden are remembered here along with the victims of Nazi Germany. There is no moral equivalence between the war records of the Nazis and the Allies. But Dresden did show how democracies, acting in a just cause, could deliberately unleash devastation on civilians in pursuit of their war aims. It’s that knowledge which gives the memory of Dresden its troubling power. Fergal Keane, BBC News, Dresden. Those commemorations will be taking place in Dresden That’s all from us.

Brand-new series The Gift: Danish police say they’ve killed the man responsible for two deadly shootings in Copenhagen. The suspect was shotjust hours after an attack outside a synagogue. Denmark’s Prime Minister vows to protect the jewish community. They belong in Denmark, they are a strong part of our community, and we will do everything we can to protect the jewish community in our country. A cease-fire in eastern Ukraine comes into effect. Fighting diminishes, but both sides accuse each other of firing shells. And Bradford shock Sunderland to book a place in the FA Caup quarterfinals. Good evening. The authorities in Denmark say a man shot dead after two deadly attacks in the capital, Copenhagen, was known to the intelligence services. They say he may have been inspired by Islamist propaganda. One person at a freedom-of-speech event yesterday was shot dead, and a jewish man was killed outside a synagogue in the early hours of this morning. The Danish Prime Minister says her country is devastated by the attacks. Lucy Williamson reports now from Copenhagen. As midnight passed in Copenhagen, Denmark’s gunman struck again. This synagogue the scene of its final killing, the victim a security guard drafted in after the earlier cafe attack. Inside were dozens of children celebrating a bat mitzvah, the jewish ceremony to mark the end of childhood. For them, the jewish ceremony to mark the end of childhood. Forthem, it of childhood. For them, it marked the end of innocence too. We didn’t hear anything and ill these swat people from the police entered the streetjust in people from the police entered the street just in front. people from the police entered the streetjust in front. -- until these SWAT people. We looked outside the window and saw this guy lying on the pavement. It was the second time the gunman had struck. On Saturday afternoon, he shot and killed a guest taking part in a debate on freedom of speech. Hours later, he fired at the synagogue, killing one man and injuring two police officers. Around dawn on Sunday, the suspect was confronted by police near his apartment and died in an exchange of fire. Passengers filmed this early-morning footage as police evacuated a train station near the suspect’s home. His body was left in the street as forensic officers moved in to start their investigation. I heard shootings and a lot of shouting from people on the street. I looked out, and there was a lot of policemen. A 9UYÂ and there was a lot of policemen. A guy, man laying on the ground, possibly dead, I think. Police say the man shot last night was already known to security services and that these shootings seems to have been inspired by the attacks in Paris last month. There’s no reason to believe that this gunman was working with anyone else, they say, but the threat from attacks like these is being felt across Europe. Today, new footage emerged of the gunman’s first victim, lying on the ground outside the cafe as someone runs to help. Across town, at the synagogue tonight, Denmark’s Prime Minister began the task of mourning the country’s loss. Our thoughts go to the whole of the jewish country’s loss. Our thoughts go to the whole of thejewish community today. They belong in Denmark, they are a strong part of our community, and we will do everything we can to protect the jewish community and we will do everything we can to protect thejewish community in our country. Outside the cafe where the attacks began, the familiar gestures of grief as another European pavement becomes a place war memorial is, another tribute to Europe’s faith in the freedom of speech. And we can speak with Lucy Williamson now, and the police operation, Lucy, after yesterday’s shootings is continuing, what more can you tell us? Well, here at Copenhagen’s main police station tonight more developments in this investigation. A large raid this evening was carried out at an internet cafe very close to where this aspect was shot dead last night. At least two people have been detained by police in that raid, and in the last few mum and some details have emerged about the suspect himself full stop -- have emerged about the suspect himself full stop -- moments. Police as saying he was 22 years old, he was born in Denmark, he was known to be a member of a gang and had a previous record for criminal acts, violent acts.

Support for them here is very strong at the moment, but this aspect was known to police, and they are going to be under pressure in the coming days to provide some answers. -- under pressure in the coming days to provide some answers. -- this suspect. The roll-out of the Government’s major reform to the benefit system begins tomorrow. Universal credit will replace six means-tested benefits and tax credits, including jobseeker’s allowance, and it will be paid once a month. Alljobcentres are expected to use the new system by this time next year. Here is our political correspondent Alex Forsyth. Plagued by problems and long overdue, universal credit is finally on the way. The flagship welfare scheme combines six benefits into one payment, which reduces as people find work. The idea is claimants don’t lose money overall by taking a job, and ministers say it’s working. People are going into work quicker, they’re staying in work longer, and are earning more, and that is as a result of universal credit. So far, the programme has been piloted in 96jobcentres. In the next two months, it’ll be in another 150, but for single people only - couples and families will have to wait. It’s due in alljobcentres by next year, but not for all claimants. It’ll be tested on simple cases first to ensure systems can cope with more complex ones. Labour backs the principle but has criticised the implementation, including costly problems with a flawed IT system. They’re now running about four years late, and they’ve wasted hundreds of millions of pounds, and I don’t think anyone at the moment can have any confidence that there is a plan in place that actually going to deliver. This policy is key to Conservative plans to get benefit claimants back to work, and making billions of pounds of welfare savings in the next Parliament, so they say it’s better to get it right than rush it through. So while the national roll-out of universal credit is about to start, it might be some time before it’s universally available. Alex Forsyth, BBC News. In Ukraine, the cease-fire between government forces and Russian backed separatists is largely holding in the east of the country. But both sides say there have been exchanges of fire near the town of Debaltseve, from where our international correspondent Ian Pannell reports. EXPLOSION Peacetime in Ukraine, apparently. But these families aren’t heading home. They’re leaving, and this is why. EXPLOSION It’s telling how no-one flinches. Accustomed to war, but tired of having to live with it. The cease-fire may have largely held, but not here, near the front-line town of Debaltseve. This area is testament to the ferocity of a war about identity and sovereignty, a battle that pits a Western leaning government against a rebel army that turns to its Russian neighbour. This was a front-line town in World War II. Imagine seeing this twice in one life. 87-year-old Matrona says she hasn’t got any power or bread. Her daughterjust thanks God they’re still alive. Rebel leaders say they’ll stick to the cease-fire in most places but not here, an area they insist isn’t covered by the peace deal. So this is day one of the cease-fire in the Ukrainian war, and while it appears to be largely holding in many front-line positions, that doesn’t seem to be the case here. We’re not far from Debaltseve, which is a key front-line area that is being heavily fought over by both sides. And for the entire time we’ve been here, we’ve been hearing the sound of fighting. It appears to be the sound of mortars, perhaps shells. It’s difficult to know which side is firing, but it does show quite how fragile this cease-fire really is. If progress can be made elsewhere, then perhaps Ukraine can move forward. For now, it’s peace of sorts, but with deadly imperfections. Ian Pannell, BBC News, Uglegorsk.

Researchers here are storing detailed 3D videos of the hearts of more than 1,500 people. Everything’s going really nicely. They’re also collecting all their genetic information as well. By getting really clear three-dimensional pictures of the heart, we hope to be able to get a much better understanding of the cause and effect of heart disease. The researchers here are sifting through huge amounts of data to try and spot slight differences. Doctors have collected so much information on so many hearts so that they can compare them and find out what the common factors are that contribute to illnesses. And this isjust one of many new scientific research projects were the experiments carried out on a computer rather than in a lab. Having large amounts of data will speed up the pace of research. Researchers at one of the world’s largest scientific meetings in California are developing better ways to compress the data. That is the type of faster discovery, because we can just learn things that we’ve never seen before. The emergence of big data can be thought of like the development of the microscope - a powerful new tool for scientists to study intricate processes in nature. Pallab Ghosh, BBC News, Sanjose.

League One side Bradford City are through to the quarter finals of the FA Cup after knocking a second Premier League club out of the competition. They beat Sunderland 2-0 today.

The authorities in Denmark say the man responsible for killing two people in separate attacks in Copenhagen yesterday, was born in the country and known to the police because of a history of gang related violence. He’s been named locally as Omar El Hussein, and he died in a shootout with police in the early hours of this morning. Tonight officers raided several premises including an internet cafe and at least two people have been detained. The Danish Prime Minister says her country is ""devastated"" by yesterday’s attacks on a cafe and a synagogue. Our Correspondent Lucy Williamson is in Copenhagen for us. As you mentioned there, the investigation here has been expanded tonight with that raid on the Internet cafe close to the apartment owned by the suspected gunman and those two people detained by police. Support for police action over the past couple of days here is very high at the moment that these attacks have stunned this nation and in the coming weeks, crossing Europe, the pressure for answers will grow. This is where Denmark’s night of terror ended, in the quiet shuffle of forensics teams around the body of its most wanted man. Wanted for crimes that had left two people dead, several police officers wounded and security of the whole country shaken. This is the man people believe that terrorised the nation, a 22-year-old gang member with a violent criminal past. Born in Denmark and named as Omar El Hussein, shot dead on a Copenhagen Street. A lot of shooting and a lot of shouting from people in the street, a lot of policeman. And a 9UY street, a lot of policeman. And a guy laying on the ground. The gunman shot twice before he died. On Saturday he shot and killed a man attending a meeting on freedom of speech. Hours later he fired at a synagogue, killing another. On Sunday he was met by police near his apartment and died in an exchange of fire. But this one-man rampage could have been so much worse. Inside the synagogue, dozens of children have been taking part in a ceremony to mark thejewish end of childhood. All that separated them from a gunman was a door, police officers and the security guard who died in the attack. He was 37 years old. Hours earlier, the gunman had claimed his first victim, a 55-year-old film director. Amid the chaos outside the cafe, he lay dying as people ran to his aid. Today the cafe window shows the brutality of that attack. This man was inside when the shooting started. They were gunshots then there was somebody who shouted, Doctor, go to the floor, they were searching the back entrance. I saw the guy with the gun, I was afraid he saw me, sol ducked behind a car. Police say the man they shot here was already known to security services and that these shootings seem to have been inspired by the attacks in Paris last month. There is no reason to believe this gunman was working with anyone else, they say, but the threat from attacks like these is being felt across Europe. Today the Prime Minister began the process of mourning these attacks and of answering them. To the whole of the jewish community today, they belong in Denmark, they are a strong part of our community and we will do everything we can to protect the jewish community in our country. One by one, Denmark’s citizens followed her in the familiar gestures of grief as another European pavement becomes a place for memorials, another tribute to Europe’s faith in freedom of speech. As security correspondent is here. We are fed these latest shootings in Denmark and of course the recent attacks in Paris. -- and of course the recent attacks in Paris. -- we have had. They worried these attacks are spreading? Yes, Europe has been itchy since the attacks in Paris, fearful of a new wave of violence and in Copenhagen, we have seen why. Here there was only one attacker rather than three in Paris, so less deadly, he appears to have been less capable but in many ways it was a copycat attack. An individual than to the authorities in the past with a record of violence, at least inspired byjihadist ideology, we don’t know whether he travelled to Iraq or Syria. Specifically targeting people associated with the cartoons of the Prophet and secondly, the jewish cartoons of the Prophet and secondly, thejewish community. The fear is that we may see more of these attacks by one or two individuals which are hard to stop hard to detect. In Germany today they cancelled a carnival in one city because of what they called credible fears of attack. In Britain, we don’t have any cartoonists or publications with the same profile as Charlie Hebdo in Paris or the cartoonist who was apparently the target of the first attack Copenhagen. We do have a jewish community, who are worried, although security has been improved. The is a worried that other targets could be found in Britain and the overall worry is that there is this fear that this kind of attack, not sophisticated but still deadly, could be the new reality in Europe that we see in the future.

It’s unclear exactly what form that will take. There is speculation government might carry out air strikes across the board.

The studios have remained empty since 1981 when the last programme-makers left, but now a plan is underway to turn them into a visitor attraction, celebrating television’s early years, as Nick Higham reports. It’s a giant Victorian people’s palace, and a place where history was made. Today it’s a thriving venue for concerts and exhibitions. But one end, beneath that great transmitter mast installed by the BBC, is underused and decaying. But this is where, in 1936, the world’s very first television service started. Vision and sound are on... The station goes on the air! # A mighty maze of mystic magic rays... # Yvonne Littewood worked here in the 1940s, one of the pioneers, making it up as they went along. It was very challenging, yes, because there was nobody to actually tell you what to do. It was a very, very basic setup, trial and error all the way. It is a bit of a mess, it was lined with hardboard in the 1970s... Now the man in charge has a plan - to turn these old studios into a BBC experience celebrating 80 years of television. We’ve got to tell the story of the amazingly cobbled together but dramatic moment when they began to broadcast from Alexandra Palace, and then beyond into colour television and all the things that happened here. So this is where it all began, but there’s virtually nothing left from those earliest days of television except the window of the control room high up on the wall there. It’s a big empty space. The question is how best to fill that space in a way that tells the story of television. The proposal is for a display featuring giant screens alongside objects from the early days. Part of the balcony on the main facade was enclosed to make room for additional apparatus... In 1936, the BBC bricked up this colonnade. Now the idea is to open it up again. But campaigners say it all means virtually nothing will be left of the BBC’s Ally Pally. Critics say the building’s uniqueness will be destroyed. Supporters retort, with so little left, what’s the alternative? Now, time for the sport. Good evening. The Wales captain, Sam Warburton, admitted they needed to beat Scotland today to maintain any hope of winning the Six Nations for the third time in four years. It was a close encounter with a somewhat controversial ending. Wales winning by 26 points to 23 at Murrayfield. For years, Scotland have into the six Nations looking a bit lost. Times are changing and they know it. Few in the world can catch Scotland’s fullback when he sets off, cruising to their second try of the tournament. But international rugby is about taking chances. Later in the half, the Scots had a man in the sin bin and redshirt flooded the space left. Rhys Webb found the space for Wales. The Welsh were also reduced to 14 and Scotland piled into punish them. Crucially, Wales held them off. In such uncomfortable spaces hatches are decided. jonathan Davies came into his own. Wales record closer to victory. There was a late Scottish charge, playing fast and with Blair but with yards to go, it was not forward. No try. With the court against them, the Scots made one last heave for the line. Welsh got there, the gap was down to five points. The gig went over with five seconds remaining. But that was where the referee left it. Fresh rating for us because we were playing good rugby. -- rating for us because we were playing good rugby. -- frustrating. I don’t know how much there was left at the end. A matter of seconds, a matter of inches, just not quite enough for Scotland. In the Women’s Six Nations, World Champions England beat Italy by 39 points to 7 at The Stoop.

The richest man in Italy and head of a global chocolate empire, Michele Ferrero, has died. He was 89. He built his company’s success on the hazelnut spread Nutella, and held a fortune estimated to be worth £15 billion. Caroline Hawley looks back at his life. This is the product that made Michele Ferrero, in the words of Forbes magazine, the richest county man on the planet. They misty publicity shy, the multi-billionaire headed a family chocolate empire with a fairy tale story. It began with one pastry shop turned by his parents into a factory. Coco was rationed in Italy during the Second World War so his father mixed it with hazelnuts from groups around the northern town of Alba, where the business was based. This was the original product, a spreadable version soon followed. It was affordable luxury and by the 1950s he is reported to have a fleet of trucks second only to the Italian army. The popularity of its products spanned generations. The brand and Teller launched by Michele Ferrero in 1954 and the world went nuts for it. The business now uses a quarter of the world’s entire Hazelnut production and earlier this year a French court stepped in to prevent a couple calling their daughter Nutella.

Egyptian warplanes have attacked so-called Islamic State targets in Libya as a response to the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian hostages, a video of which emerged last night. F-16jets took off during the night and in the early morning to strike training camps and weapons stores at Derna, in a country where Islamist extremists are seen as a growing threat. Our Cairo Correspondent Orla Guerin reports on the strikes, and also from the village close to Minya, which was home to 13 of the 21 Christians murdered by IS. Under cover of darkness, Egyptian warplanes setting out for a bombing mission inside Libya. Swift retribution for the beheading of Coptic Christians and the opening of a new battlefront in the Middle East.

Coptic Christians are a minority here and often complain of neglect, but this time they are being avenged. The village streets tell their own story of despair and hardship. Relatives say that the men were driven from their homes here in the village by grinding poverty and lack of work. They followed a well trodden path to Libya. It is the only option for many desperate Egyptians, and locals here tell us that in spite of what has happened, men from this area will continue to make thatjourney. We men from this area will continue to make that journey. We could go to Libya tomorrow, this man says, and the day after. People prefer to die there than Olivia. -- the day after. People prefer to die there than Olivia. -- than leave here. The loss of so many in such a brutal way has shaken Egypt. The country’s responds to the killings may have implications for the wider Middle East. As you heard there, the Egyptian air strikes in Libya have opened up a new front in the war against Islamic State with the extremists there exploiting a power vacuum after the fall of Colonel Gaddafi. Our Diplomatic Correspondent james Robbins is here to explain. Of course, we’re used to the idea of so-called IS - Islamic State - being in Iraq and Syria where the movement is thought to have up to 30,000 fighters operating in both countries. It’s now very clear IS is in Libya too, spreading its influence in that ungovernable country which borders Egypt. The IS stronghold is the city of Derna, but they are only one of hundreds of militias vying for power in Libya, a country torn apart by factionalism. It’s a very far cry from the country which Britain and France thought they had helped save less than four years ago. David Cameron and the then French President Nicolas Sarkozyjointly President Nicolas Sarkozy jointly celebrated President Nicolas Sarkozyjointly celebrated with the Libyans of Benghazi after leading Western air strikes which helped save the city and bring down Colonel Gaddafi, a ruthless dictator. Colonel Gaddafi said he would hunt you down like rats, but you show the courage of lions, and we salute your courage. This is the moment that David Cameron told them that the Arab Spring could become the Arab summer, but instead what followed? The rebels turned on each other, and Libya simply fell apart. Fast forward three and a half years, and this is Benghazi last month, a city largely undamaged in the revolution to bring down Gaddafi, but now ruined by those same rebels killing each other. Literally hundreds of rival militia fight for control of a collapsing state. Amid the bloodshed, with two competing Libyan governments, in effect a civil war, the extremists of Islamic State saw their chance and started building their own power base inside Libya as well. Last month, suicide bombers got into the Carinthia, one of Tripoli’s luxury hotels, used by foreign visitors. Islamic State claimed it was their work, as proof that they can even reach into the capital city. So how will the West respond? The Prime Minister of Italy, former colonial power of Libya, is backing away from Western military intervention. I think this is a time to exercise wisdom, prudence and understanding. This is a serious situation and we must not go from total indifference to hysteria and unreasonable concern. And David Cameron, who told Libyans on a return visit in 2013 that we would stand with you every step of the way, he is also sending strong signals from Downing Street today that the only hope from -- signals from Downing Street today that the only hope from -- for Libya is a political not military solution. It’s no surprise that Western powers will not easily get drawn into military intervention again, but many voices are warning that the extremists of IAS in Libya are edging closer to Europe. Egypt wants others tojoin are edging closer to Europe. Egypt wants others to join the strikes are edging closer to Europe. Egypt wants others tojoin the strikes in Libya, warning that boats carrying migrants from Libya to Italy could soon be full of extremist fighters as well. More than 2000 migrants were rescued between Libya and Italy by the Italian coastguard this we in. The migrants, mostly from North Africa but had saved -- migrants, mostly from North Africa but had saved -- sailed in boats provided by people smugglers and 3000 died in rough seas last week -- 300. Two men have appeared in court in Copenhagen accused of helping the gunman suspected of murdering two people on Saturday. The charges include hiding the killerand helping him dispose of a weapon. Flags have been flying at half mast across Denmark, as a sign of respect for the victims. Our Special Correspondent Lucy Manning is in Copenhagen. Lucy. Behind me people are still coming to leave flowers outside the cafe where the first shooting happened. Thousands are expected here in the next hour for a vigil. The people and politicians of Denmark are coming to grief, to remember. The Crown Prince, the Prime Minister, the French ambassador to Denmark who was in the cafe when the shooting happened, and members of the jewish community. All this on the day that we found out more about the man suspected of carrying out the attacks. Omar Al Hussein in the black shorts showing his aggression inside the ring. Named by local media as the gunmen it was his violence outside on the streets of Copenhagen that Denmark is struggling to understand. The 22-year-old, a gang member, had only just come out of prison for violence. Prison authorities had identified him as having radical views while inside. At the college she attended, -- views while inside. At the college she attended, -- he attended, this woman knew him. When you saw him in the hallway, he always said hi to people, but he was very quiet, and he was a loner, and he walked a lot by himself. Today, two men were charged with helping him. They are charged with hiding the firearm and providing shelter for the perpetrator. And they are denying the charges. The suspected of-- respective governments murdered two men at the cafe. This man had been protecting this girl and her family and friends who were celebrating her bar mitzvah, her coming-of-age ceremony. They ended the night barricaded in a panic room. My main focus was keeping the children calm and safe. Was the door bullet-proof? What is going to happen next? How am I going to explain this to my children? And how... What will I say to his parents? What will I say to the security guard’s parents? Although grateful to the police men who were also injured, they believe they should have been greater security. But the Prime Minister does not believe the attacks were part of a wider terrorist network. He was also known to be linked to a criminal gang in Copenhagen. But I want to make very clear that we have no indication, at this stage, that he was part of a cell. Denmark is defiant nervous. -- but nervous. Every school leaver in England with the required grades will be eligible for an apprenticeship, if Labour wins the General Election. The leader Ed Miliband said Labour would create at least 80,000 new apprenticeships by the end of the next parliament. But the Tories said their plans included putting a further three million people onto the schemes. Our Political Correspondent Ben Wright has more. A growing business in a growing economy. As Labour bashes out its manifesto plans for business, it is companies like this that need convincing. For me, they should focus on infrastructure, transport, training, all the things we know we have got a shortfall in, particularly around this area where transport connectivity is a real issue. If they can help is with that, then businesses will take the risk. We are quite good at creating opportunities and taking advantages of them. Today at jaguar Land Rover, Ed Miliband set out his party’s stall, repeating promises to freeze business rates and keep Britain in the EU. And there was a new pledge on apprenticeships. We need a better plan to create an economy where tens of billions are lost in tax avoidance, and an economy where tens of thousands of young people need apprenticeships. We need a better plan to help businesses, grow, succeed and create wealth. Labour say they will guarantee an extra 80,000 on-the-job training places by 2020, open to people with the equivalent of two A-levels. The party’s recent attack on tax avoidance through Ed Balls into an attack about trimming the garden hedge. He said people should seek a receipt for a cashjob, no matter how small. Do you think it is always wrong for small businesses to accept cash in hand for work? People need to pay theirfair share cash in hand for work? People need to pay their fair share of taxes. That is what counts. Hedge funds is dealing with these issues are more important than the hedge cutters, and that clarity of you is right across the Shadow Cabinet. -- clarity of view. The Conservatives said Labour did not understand how business works. Ed Miliband, who has never run a business and has never done anything but politics, is the last person in the world we should listen to on this. He wants to destroy business. Some business group -- destroy business. Some business group -- groups said the plan from Labour today was a welcome change in tone. With the election tight, and economic credibility key, Ed Miliband seems to have found his pro-business boys. While the Tories say they will run the economy more efficiently and Labour say they will run it more fairly, companies like they say they hope for stability. -- pro-business voice.

The ceasefire in eastern Ukraine is looking increasingly fragile, just a day after it was meant to start. The Ukrainian military command said pro-Russian rebels had attacked 112 times since early yesterday, and the rebels, who hold Donetsk airport, accused Ukrainian forces of shelling it. From there, our international correspondent Ian Pannell reports. This is what a scorched earth policy actually looks like. Barely recognisable for what it is. Donetsk airport. A symbol of the searing intensity of the war in Ukraine that’s supposed to have stopped. A battle that pitch is a Western leaning government against a rebel army that turned to its Russian neighbour. -- army that turned to its Russian neighbour. -- that pitches. This is day two of a shaky cease-fire, heavy weapons are supposed to be pulled back, but that isn’t what’s happening here. The rebel Defence Minister says he will only pull his forces back when he has proof the Ukrainians on this front line have withdrawn theirs. But the issue that threatens the peace deal isn’t that the guns haven’t pulled back, it’s that they are still firing. This is supposed to be day two of the cease-fire in eastern Ukraine. But as we have been hearing... The piece has not settled in. We have been hearing the consistent sound of artillery being fired, there’s another one... Most of it appears to be outgoing. The people of the Donetsk’s People’s Republic are saying... Stay together. Run, run. The Ukrainians insist they haven’t broken the cruise, accusing the rebels of shelling their own territory. -- rebels of shelling their own territory. -- broken the truce. That is firing out. TRANSLATION: No, it’s in and out. The Defence Minister says he is trying to stop the enemy from firing at their positions. The last effort to stop this war failed. Today’s peace deal has held in most places, but there is a clear risk that what we are watching is history repeating itself. Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has been told to pay $10 million in damages after losing a lawsuit with a promotion company. In 2006, the company had been forced to pay Armstrong £5 million, but the cyclist has since admitted to doping in all seven of his Tour de France wins. Visitors are being stopped from going to all hospitals in Herefordshire in an attempt to ease the pressure on services, and to prevent the spread of norovirus. The virus, known as the winter vomiting bug, is highly contagious. The Wye Valley NHS Trust has around 50% of its beds affected by the virus, closing wards and bays. Non-emergency operations have also been cancelled. Smoking the most potent forms of cannabis is being linked to almost a quarter of new cases of psychosis. The research from Kings College London suggests the risk of getting the mental health condition, which can include paranoia and delusions, is three times higher for users of skunk-like cannabis than for people who use a milder form of the drug. Our Midlands correspondent Sian Lloyd has been talking to a former user. At that time, I did not know the damage about smoking stronger strains. Ijust wanted the next one, the next one. This man now volunteers at a drop-in centre for addicts. He smoked cannabis, including the highly potent a drop-in centre for addicts. He smoked cannabis, including the highly potent rioting known as skunk, for 30 years. It brought me depression, anxiety, it brought me to a very dark place. There was not much I wanted to do apart from get up, smoked cannabis, stay in bed, watch daytime programmes. That’s everything macro are used to like doing. -- everything macro are used to like doing. -- that’s all I like doing. I would get anxiety. The only time I went out was to buy some more and come back. The research studied 780 people in south London. It found users of the potent skunk like form of cannabis were more than three times more likely to develop psychosis. People who used it every day were five times more likely to be at risk. The milder form of the drug, hash, was not associated with an increased risk of mental health conditions. The research into the use of skunk found increased symptoms like hallucinations and paranoia, but not in every case. Skunk plays an important role, it increases your chances by three to five times but it’s not the only course of psychotic disorder. Cannabis is now a home-grown industry. This room in Birmingham is used by emergency services during their training used by emergency services during theirtraining in how used by emergency services during their training in how to respond to cannabis farms, Inc losing lead found in people’s times. -- increasingly found in people’s times. The strength of cannabis grown is becoming more potent. Some varieties being cultivated contain more of the compound linked to psychosis. The possible dangers posed by the drug have traditionally been hotly contested, but the government says this research supports its position that cannabis should remain an illegal drug. The head of world athletics has admitted that allegations of widespread doping in Russia have left the sport in ""crisis"". IAAF president Lamine Diack told the BBC that the claims, aired in a German TV documentary, were ""shocking"" and ""disturbing."" But he said the world governing body had not been involved in a cover-up. He’s been speaking exclusively to our sports editor, Dan Roan. Athletics’ fight against drug cheats has been a long one. I’vejust been handed a piece of paper here, and if it’s right, it would be the most dramatic story out of these Olympics or perhaps any other. Benjohnson of Canada has been caught taking drugs. But after so many scandals, track and field could now be facing its greatest challenge to date. Last year, a German documentary alleged state-sponsored doping by Russian competitors, sending shock waves through the sport. Now in a rare interview, the man in charge of world athletics told me he accepted the scale of the problem. We face a difficult situation in Russia. We used to face a difficult situation in the United States. It’s more than difficult, isn’t it? This is a full-blown crisis. Yes, it’s a crisis. Absolutely. We have to put this behind us. But we will arrive to make it. As the IAAF investigates, training continues for athletes like British 800 metre runnerjenny Meadows. She’s lost races to Russians who have since been found to have doped and is clear how much is at stake. I live in hope that the authorities do tackle it right, but if it is as widespread as the allegations do deem, I think it would just kill our sport. Sponsors may walk away from the sport, and fans may walk away. World athletics’ governing body has been implicated in the alleged cover-up of Russian doping. The IAAF’s marketing chief Papa Massata Diack, the son of the president himself, seen here on the far left, is under investigation. A father is not happy to see his children accused of that. But I’m sure that he will clear his name. I’m convinced, I know what was in my department. I know he works very, very hard. I didn’t see any reason to make a cover-up of a doping case. So no IAAF cover-up, to be clear? No. But as Diack knows all too well, in sport, image is everything. London 2012 was meant to be the cleanest Olympics ever. Many now will have their doubts. The charity set up in the name of jane Tomlinson, who competed in endurance events after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, has now raised over £7.5 million. She died in 2007, at the age of A3, having raised almost £2 million herself. Her daughter Rebecca said the current total was ""beyond all expectations"". Eight years ago, a Taliban bomb in Afghanistan shattered Ben Parkinson’s body. The Lance Bombadier lost both his legs and was in a coma for four months. Now, after pioneering treatment, the 30-year-old is learning to walk again. Robert Hall went to speak to him. Come on, get ugly! This is where we’re working. Again. Push yourself! This is the face of a man who has never given up. Ben Parkinson’s body was shattered in a moment. But for eight years, hope and self belief have shone in his eyes. Beneath the Olympic flame on the streets of his home town, Ben seized the day. The world was with him. Every step Ben takes is a giant stride, and he’s still out to impress. Today, for the first time, he felt confident enough to walk alone, away from the family members who have always been close by. You must start to feel real independence, don’t you? Ido. In a way. I can’t... talk properly yet. But when I do, I’ll be so happy. Ben, everything OK? Great. The transformation owes much to the life-changing therapy offered at this hospital in the Scottish Borders. The team here have been using a hyperbaric chamber where Ben can breathe pure oxygen at twice our atmospheric pressure. Oxygen is a key part of any healing process. Some experts say it can help regenerate damaged tissue and cells. In Ben’s case, the improvement was dramatic. Afterjust four weeks, nerves and muscles are beginning to function. It’s the start of a new stage in his recovery, and perhaps an end to the darkest days. I’ve had times when I’ve just thought, are we doing the right thing even fighting for him to survive? Is this what he’d want? Less and less now, but... Bad times. Some fellas can’t do it, can’t walk. I’m going to walk. And I’m going to prove them all wrong. As you saw him walking through the house today, that’s the best I’ve ever seen him, the straightest up. It’s because muscles are bouncing off each other. I want all the other injured people, notjust military, everyone, to think, if he can do it, why can’t I? Run winter weather, but brutal winter weather is still in the north-east of the USA. And in north-eastern Canada. High temperatures today, but factoring in the wind, to add insult to injury, it is bitterly cold, and more snow to come for Washington, DC and New York. All I can offer you hear is a fast in racing nights, but still not particularly cold. A few more hours of rain overnight. Scattered wintry showers towards the north-west, some rain, sleet and snow and a brisk wind in the far north of Scotland.

Londoner Idris Elba stars in a new blockbuster with a co-star more famous for his sonnets than skills in special operations. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. A talented footballer who was left brain damaged after suffering a heart attack on the pitch has won a legal case for damages against his Premier League club and a cardiologist. Radwan Hamed was playing his first game since signing as a professional Tottenham Hotspur player when he collapsed in 2006 aged 17. Today, a High Courtjudge said the club had failed him in their duty of care, including not telling the player about an abnormal ECG. Mr Hamed could be awarded a multi-million pound payout. Chris Slegg reports. Arriving at the High Court today, the parents of Radwan Hamed, seeking answers as to who was to blame for failing to tell their son he had a heart condition which left him severely brain-damaged. Today is a good day for the truth. Very emotional still. good day for the truth. Very emotionalstill. I emotional still. I can feel it. We are going back years. It is hard, standing here. No man would take what he had to take. Injuly standing here. No man would take what he had to take. In july 2005, then 16 years old, Radwan Hamed were said for routine scans by Tottenham. A abnormality was spotted and an MRI was recommended. The following month, he had an MRI scan, which appeared normal but could not on its own exclude the presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This was the condition which nearly killed him. On receiving the MRI results, the head of Tottenham’s medical department failed to book the clinical review. The following summer, with no clinical review, he signed a professional contract. Nine days later, six minutes into his debut game, at a match in Belgium, he collapsed. Or get football. He could have been a strong man, an able man. He could have gone to university. He could have had a life, stuff around ten comment he could have had a girlfriend and a properjob. That has all been taken away from him. A smack stuff around ten. Today, the judge ruled that he had been failed both by the club and by his doctors. The judge ruled that Doctor Mills was 30% liable for what happened and Tottenham was 70% liable. On receiving the judgements, Tottenham said: Radwan Hamed Boty was embarking on a dream career, but he took to the pitch without anyone having told him about the heart condition which has ruined his life. -- about the heart condition which has ruined his life. -- box he was. -- Boty was. There could be a multi-million pound pay-out, as I mentioned. The family say that would cover the cost perhaps of his future career earnings. He would not have been allowed to continue as a footballer if they had known the result of those scans, but they say he would have had a very successful career in whatever field he had chosen to go into. The costs will also cover the rehabilitation he has had to date. He has recovered some mobility and vision, but he will never live independently.

Plus: Londoner Idris Elba stars in a new blockbuster with a co-star We understand you have some information. You want to tell us where it is? Londoner Idris Elba stars in a new blockbuster with a co-star more famous for his sonnets than skills in special operations. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. A talented footballer who was left brain damaged after suffering a heart attack on the pitch has won a legal case for damages against his Premier League club and a cardiologist. Radwan Hamed was playing his first game since signing as a professional Tottenham Hotspur player when he collapsed in 2006 aged 17. Today, a High Courtjudge said the club had failed him in their duty of care, including not telling the player about an abnormal ECG. Mr Hamed could be awarded a multi-million pound payout. Chris Slegg reports. Arriving at the High Court today, the parents of Radwan Hamed, seeking answers as to who was to blame for failing to tell their son he had a heart condition which left him severely brain-damaged. Today is a good day for the truth. Very emotional still. good day for the truth. Very emotionalstill. I emotional still. I can feel it. We are going back years. It is hard, standing here. No man would take what he had to take. Injuly standing here. No man would take what he had to take. In july 2005, then 16 years old, Radwan Hamed were said for routine scans by Tottenham. A abnormality was spotted and an MRI was recommended. The following month, he had an MRI scan, which appeared normal but could not on its own exclude the presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This was the condition which nearly killed him. On receiving the MRI results, the head of Tottenham’s medical department failed to book the clinical review. The following summer, with no clinical review, he signed a professional contract. Nine days later, six minutes into his debut game, at a match in Belgium, he collapsed. Or get football. He could have been a strong man, an able man. He could have gone to university. He could have had a life, stuff around ten comment he could have had a girlfriend and a properjob. That has all been taken away from him. A smack stuff around ten. Today, the judge ruled that he had been failed both by the club and by his doctors. The judge ruled that Doctor Mills was 30% liable for what happened and Tottenham was 70% liable. On receiving the judgements, Tottenham said: Radwan Hamed Boty was embarking on a dream career, but he took to the pitch without anyone having told him about the heart condition which has ruined his life. -- about the heart condition which has ruined his life. -- box he was. -- Boty was. There could be a multi-million pound pay-out, as I mentioned. The family say that would cover the cost perhaps of his future career earnings. He would not have been allowed to continue as a footballer if they had known the result of those scans, but they say he would have had a very successful career in whatever field he had chosen to go into. The costs will also cover the rehabilitation he has had to date. He has recovered some mobility and vision, but he will never live independently. He will have to be cared for for the rest of his life. Clearly some lessons here for the sport. Yes, awareness of heart conditions in football has been raised by several high profile incidents, and Tottenham saved another player’s life. It just goes to show the complex issues that arise in football. Many people say that annual screenings should be mandatory for footballers in this country. We spoke to someone from the heart for more foundation who is a former football player, who had a heart attack on the pitch. Thankfully, he has no lasting consequences. He says that far more needs to be done in this country and is among those fighting for annual heart screenings in football. Thank you very much. Coming up later in the programme: The stigma around mental health means that many children do not get the help they so badly need. Kate Middleton’s appeal for a change in attitudes about mental health - we speak to young Londoners about how they feel. More now on the events in Copenhagen, where flags have been flying at half mast as a sign of respect for the victims. Here, the Metropolitan Police say they are doing all they can to reassure people in the capital who may be feeling exposed. It comes as some jewish community leaders in Europe are calling for 2lI-hour security, but there are concerns that a similar approach here would be counter-productive. Our home affairs correspondent Nick Beake reports. For the members of the Monday club, it is always a chance to catch up on the weekend’s events, but for many today, including this woman, their thoughts turn to how the Danish attacks may affect jews here thoughts turn to how the Danish attacks may affectjews here in London. I am getting a little bit anxious and not so much for me but for the rest of myjewish population. In London, personallyl feel quite secure. We come to synagogue and have been coming year, we don’t make any differentiation between what happens one week and the next, so we carry on with our normal activities. On Saturday, the Copenhagen gunmen targeted a free-speech event as well as a synagogue, and that has prompted a re-evaluation of security here. I would prompted a re-evaluation of security here. Iwould be here. I would be lying if I said that people were not worried and feeling vulnerable, so there is definitely a sense in which there is a pastoral challenge to think about how we support one another, because it is a new feeling for us in the jewish community in London, to feel at risk. But I also think we need to have a sense of perspective as well. The Met police have been liaising with the jewish as well as Muslim communities extensively since the attacks in Paris last month, and to date, they were keen to reassure. I can completely understand howjewish communities are fuelling anxiety at this moment in time, but I must say that-- this moment in time, but I must say that -- feeling anxiety, but we have been strengthening our commitment to them and making sure that they feel protected. Especially at times when they may feel more vulnerable. Officers have been on the street speaking to people. In the wake of the attacks, some groups believe thatjewish communities in European capital cities, including London, need a much greater level of protection. What happened in Copenhagen, it was very clear to was to see that there is no time when the terrorist specifically prefers to come. It could be Iam. jewish people could be targeted at any time, and we have to make sure that they are protected 24 hours a day. Backin they are protected 24 hours a day. Back in London, that is not seen as the solution. I would not want that, because I do not think terrorism works like that. If we spend our time in fortresses, we will only turn inwards. Some groups may feel more and easier than others, but the threat we face is one that effect all of the communities which make up our city. A convicted rapist who was recently released from prison was found dead shortly before police discovered the bodies of his parents at their home on an estate near Paddington on Saturday. It’s believed Ashraf Amrani killed the couple before taking his own life. Alice Bhandhukravi is at the scene now and can tell us more. In that is right. You will see behind me the police tent outside the house of the murder victims. I am told that they were a Moroccan couple. They were the parents of Ashraf Amrani, a convicted rate this who has recently been released from prison where he had been serving a sentence since 2010. We know that on Tuesday last week, Ashraf Amrani was arrested on suspicion of causing a disturbance. I have been told by people here locally that he had tried to attack someone with a knife, but he was released on bail, and he returned here to his parent’s. The police were called last Wednesday and his mother has looked sad and said that there had been some trouble there. On Friday, Ashraf Amrani’s body was discovered in the adjacent building just in front of me on the roof covering the rubbish bins here. When police went to visit his next of kin to tell them what had happened, they found the bodies of his parents inside their own home. I spoke to resident earlier, and they told me what has happened here is very worrying. I am shocked, because we don’t usually have murders around here, it is usuallyjust fights. I am really shocked. I’ve never really liked this estate, so... This just proves me right now to be honest. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is looking into this, because people leave had been called last Wednesday. One neighbour has said that Ashraf Amrani had tried to block the door to the police when they were called. The Met says it is not looking for anyone else in connection with this double murder, but the investigation continues to find out what exactly happened here. Police have described as ""callous and sickening"" an attack on a 92-year-old man, who was mugged and robbed of £5. They’ve released these CCTV pictures of the attack, which took place at the end of last month as he returned to his home in Soho from the shops. Although the victim wasn’t badly hurt detectives say he’s a fiercely independent man who is now afraid to go out. Passengers in London and the South East are the least satisfied commuters in the country. A survey of 7000 travellers by the consumer’s association, Which, found Southern is the worst in the country for delays. The government insists it’s investing record amounts in the rail network and says the industry must deliver essential improvements in the future. Delays, poor value for money and dirty toilets. According to the latest train satisfaction survey, passengers are not happy. 29% of all rail passengers suffered a delay when they last travelled. Sutherland where worst or delays, with 39% of customers saying they were delayed on their lastjourney. -- on their last journey. -- Sutherland. on their lastjourney. -- Sutherland. -- on their lastjourney. -- Sutherland. -- Southern. Commuters in London are saying they are fed up with being through the nose for duty, old, overcrowded and late trains. It is completely unacceptable as the costs of travelling by rail are spiralling, but these are the sorts of conditions that people are being expected to endure. The figures differ significantly from the industry’s own surveys, which suggest that 89% of rail passengers are satisfied with their service. When you compare the services we have in the UK compared to overseas, the trains may not be on time, but sometimes in a lot of countries, there is no time for the train. You could be waiting a few hours to get a train. There are too many people, especially when you want to go to work and your places to go to. The rail delivery group which represents the rail operators told Meanwhile, Southern believed major redevelopment works at London Bridge are partly responsible for their poor performance in the survey. Despite the findings, new figures show that passenger numbers have actually grown by 16% in the last four years. Next, the Duchess of Cambridge has made a filmed appeal for parents to talk to their children about problems they may be facing at school. It’s part of a support programme by a London charity, Place2be, in the first ever Childrens’ mental health week. It’s a subject close to the hearts of pupils at one South London school, where they have started a project to promote mental wellbeing. Sarah Harris went to meet them. Sariah to Hannah, is everything OK in the auditorium? She may only be eight years old, but today at the Southbank Centre, Sariah is definitely in charge. It is all part of teacher’s efforts at Grantham Primary in Streatham to promote the mental health of pupils by giving them a voice. It means they are more likely to speak up if they encounter problems. I would first speak to my friends to see if they could help me and if they couldn’t I would speak to a teacher. Then the teacher, if I tell the teacher, they might tell my mum. Without support, the effects of these challenges can be traumatic... And learning to speak so openly at an early age is a skill that the Duchess of Cambridge is keen to promote. The stigma around mental health means that many children do not get the help that they so badly need. This needs to change. That is why the charity Place To Be is asking us all to talk openly this week. We need to help young people and their parents understand that it’s not a sign of weakness to ask for help. At the Southbank Centre, children are being given adult’s jobs to build up their self-esteem, but teachers also hold workshops for parents, who they say they are encouraging to get off their phones and listen. It is a vital part of the curriculum at Grantham, which we have built up ourselves, to include very much the children having their own voice and celebrating that, so all our curriculum is based on their questions and their context and the areas they are learning. We’ve recently done a whole topic on children’s rights, which involved healthy minds and mental well-being. Brimming with confidence, Sariah is leading the way for other children to understand if they have worries, their voices will be heard. Still to come this evening: Wolf Hall’s Mark Rylance teams up with Londoner Idris Elba on the red carpet for the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Next, if you like your beer, this could be a perfect opportunity to turn a hobby into a business. London’s first community brewery opened its doors today, teaching people how to make their own brews and potentially sell it on. jean Mackenzie has been to Bermondsey to learn how it’s done. Amongst the pubs and breweries in Bermondsey, is one with a difference. It has got the equipment, the ingredients and the expertise, but these brewers are not going to make the beer for you. You have to do that yourself. The first step is the mashed top. We will put them in water and activate the enzymes. This will then ferment and turn into alcohol. We need to stir it to make sure we get a nice even mash. We have transpired it into a boiling kettle and now we are ready to add the hops. Chuck them in there. Stir them up a little bit, and we will start to extract our compounds. The brewery was founded by two friends and home brewing enthusiasts who wanted to give Londoners the chance to share their passion. Foryears, home-brew was seen as this thing that your grandfather did or something that tasted terrible. We are giving people the skills and the technology to do it properly. A decade ago, it was the big breweries which dominated, and there was little else available, but in the last few years, dozens of microbreweries have opened across London, and the interest in craft beer has risen. This takes brewing to an even more micro level. The next set instrumentation. We put it into the fermentation tank along with the used, which will turn the sugars into alcohol. -- used, which will turn the sugars into alcohol. -- the next step is fermentation. We will transfer the beer into the bottle. It tank makes 120 bottles and it costs £40 per month to use the brewery, there is money to be made here, but it is not quite as easy as it looks. when Cromwell met Luther. Mark Rylance is the theatre actor currently appearing in the BBC drama Wolf Hall. And Idris Elba is known for playing the TV detective in the hit series Luther. Now the two, together with Sean Penn, star in the Hollywood film The Gunman which premieres in London tonight. Our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus caught up with them on the red carpet. He has a producer credit but Sean Penn also stars in the action thriller, The Gunman. He plays a Government contractor betrayed by his previous employees and first to go on the run. The co-stars are pretty impressive to. Before we speak to a couple of them, here is a clip of the film. Someone tried to kill me three days ago. Have you actually seen the finished product yet? I haven’t seen it yet. Is that normal? Yes, it is. Sean has probably seen it but we haven’t. I saw it this morning, and I thought it was a high action thriller with some tender bits in the middle. What made you want to be a part of it? I like Sean. Yes. I second that. He is a movie legend and it was a great opportunity to do something different. With them, he is always doing something different. It has multiple locations. One of them is in London will stop it is also littered with great London talent. It is fair to say that Hollywood has been embracing London stars. I think English actors have always had a presence in Hollywood, and at the moment there is a slew of really great actors, American, Australian, English and otherwise. It is a great time for talent and I think Hollywood is opening its doors to outside of America, so you are seeing more actors come in. I must say, congratulations. Another word. Yes, it was great to get that award. I had a great time. Did you get mobbed? Yes. Yes, he got mobbed. The film opens on March the 20th. They’re calling it one of the biggest events in soap opera history - the Live Week on 'EastEnders’, when viewers finally find out who killed Lucy Beale. For 30 years, the BBC soap has been creating memorable moments and characters like Nasty Nick and Dirty Den. Graham Satchell reports on the latest drama from Albert Square. Stinks in here, doesn’t it? It started with a death. EastEnders, the BBC’s grittier, more realistic answer to Coronation Street. This has got to be the sickest joke you have ever played. And Den fell for it. At one stage, it was so popular, 13 million people watched this moment. This, my sweet, is a letter from my solicitor telling you that your husband has filed a petition for divorce. Happy Christmas, Ange. So, Peter, was the original brief to try and make it look as kind of gritty and real as possible? Absolutely. That was absolutely the brief. This is Bassett Square in the east end of London, the inspiration for Albert Square. Peter Findlay worked on the original design. We had an east end that was going through a recession during the Thatcher period. It was very difficult and there were a lot of rundown areas. Now it’s changing. It has changed a lot. We were reflecting something that I think was more real. When EastEnders started, this was a down-at-heel, still pretty working-class part of London. Today, it has been all but gentrified. A house on the square will now cost you more than a million pounds. The nearest pub, not the Queen Vic, but the Queen Elizabeth, has been turned into flats. There is still a street market, so what do traders here make of EastEnders today? They centre around the pub, which is lovely, as it was 20 years ago, but I don’t know people actually do that now. Adam Woodyatt has played Ian Beale for the last 30 years. This particular part of London, if you literally took everybody out of it, did up all the houses, they would all be like one million plus. None of the people who are here now could afford them. It is a drama. I never thought it was that real back in the early 80s. And it probably isn’t now. But it is the representation that it needs to be. This week promises more drama. A marriage, maybe a birth, and the answer to a long-running question. Did you kill Lucy Beale? Oh, is that the time? I’ve just got to do something over there... MUSIC PLAYS: The Eastenders theme Time for a check on the weather with Wendy Hurrell. How’s this week looking? Sunshine is back. Not very nice now. More of the sunshine will be back and it will fuel a little colder, but it will definitely be a wet side of the day, because we started with some cloud and we will have the return of the sunshine. Right now, we have a lot of cloud and that has brought us the afternoon, and it has really set in for the first part of the night at least. Persistent rain falling as it has done through the afternoon. It is slowly shifting eastwards as we go through the night. The breeze will pick up a little bit as well. By midnight, most of us should have seen the back of that rain. There will be some clear sky that starts to get through. It may be cold enough or some frost. -- through. It may be cold enough or some frost. -- for some frost. Be aware of icy patches on the roads in the morning. Lovely sunshine to enjoy in the morning, though. It will be feeling quite pleasant once the temperature rises to nine Celsius. The skies will stay clear as we go through the night, so Tuesday into Wednesday, we are looking at temperatures dipping below freezing. This is what we are looking at in the towns and cities, but some places in the countryside will be looking at those of freezing. So a frost to look out for. A decent day for Wednesday following on from that. There will be some cloud in the sky, but their astute also be some sunny spells. -- there should also. Thursday, eventually, we will get some sunny spells, but for most of the day it will be gloomy and dry. Thank you very much. The day’s headlines: Egyptian warplanes have attacked so-called Islamic State targets in Libya as a response to the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian hostages. Two men have appeared in court in Copenhagen accused of helping the gunman suspected of murdering two people on Saturday. The charges include hiding the killerand helping him dispose of a weapon. A Tottenham player who was left brain damaged after a heart attack on the pitch in 2006 has won the right to sue the club. That’s it, thanks forjoining us. More on the day’s stories on our website. And I’ll be back later during the ten o’clock news. Have a lovely evening. Bye for now. It’s about time we kicked off tonight’s entertainment. jANGL|NG Ah... Huargh! Ooh... GROANS CLANG! I can see you’ve got some... foreign visitors? Hello and welcome to The One Show with Alexjones. And Matt Baker. What links a new exhibition at the V & A, close shaves at level crossings and spiders that are sail across the water? That’s everyone on tonight’s show. Correct. Here is another. What is the connection between Piers Morgan, Steve McFadden, David Cameron, Michael Burke, Keith Chegwin and Richard Osman? That is a tougher question, but why don’t we just ask one of them as we welcome Richard Osman! Welcome. What is the link? Is it the short list for the next Bond? Sounded like it. Tell us what it is really because it’s not far off is it? It’s about your looks? It’s the annual heatwave list of men. Don’t be coy. Handsome men. Yes, it is. Heat’s list of weird crushes, but Matt Baker you are not in it. I don’t even know anything about it, but the question is, where on that list do you hope you are, because you have been on it a few years haven’t you? I won it a few years back. You won it? ! Yes, 2011. Which is increasingly a long time ago now. Here is the weird thing, do you want to be further up the list or lower? That’s the problem, I don’t know. It’s a tricky place to be. I want to come top five but maybe not win. I think that’s the key on that list. OK. I don’t want to lose to Piers Morgan, that’s the absolute key. john Richardson and Russell Howard, that’s fine but if you lost to say Keith Chegwin or Piers Morgan! This is the thing because you know you’re in the top 50 this year. Wow, that is some vote. But we have it on good authority that you a actually in the top three! No! That’s good. You don’t know who the top two are? We can’t tell you. You do know. We can also say, go on, deliver this piece of news or shall I do it? You have beaten Piers Morgan. A victory for common-sense. They say broken Britain but that shows us in a very good light. We have give then item enough time I think! Let’s crack on. All right. If you are one of those people that gets frustrated when the barrier is down at a level crossing, Dom has some advice for you. This is the moment a cyclist thought she could ignore the barriers at a level crossing. Sadly, it’s farfrom the only time someone’s diced with death trying to go through crossings like these. There are more than 330 near misses every year. And last year’s figures show seven people died in accidents on our crossings. OI’! OUT CI’oSSiI’IgS. on our crossings. Why would otherwise ordinary sensible people even think about taking that risk? For many people, it’s a stupid decision made in an instant. For Ian Carter from Hampshire, decision made in an instant. For Ian Carterfrom Hampshire, it’s Carter from Hampshire, it’s also one he’s regretted ever since. Cycling home from work one night, he thought he could beat the barriers. This is what happened next. Hitting the barrier, then catapulting over it left Ian needing 36 stitches and four hours of surgery on his face. But he got off lightly. Ian, this was a crossing where you had your accident that night. If you look at the barrier where it comes down, which is here, and look at the train line, you are only that far away. You hit the barrier and went over. Can you imagine what happened had you bounced back the other way? I could have simply lost my life, been knocked unconscious, train come round the corner and run me over completely and that would have been the end of me. With permanent scars and a £5,000 fine, Ian’s wrecklessness has cost him dearly, but do others realise the risk they are taking? Last year, more than 1300 drivers were caught by police risking their lives on the lines. Today, British Transport Police are keeping an eye on a busy level crossing in Bedhampton, Hampshire and they have brought along a van kited out with the latest cameras to help. Hi, Graham. Hello, Dom. There’sjust 15 of these vehicles covering more than 6,000 level crossings, but it’s not long before we capture a driver’s wrecklessness on camera. Oh, look, that’s live, yes. That’s live. That’s now. So he’s in for a ticking off. I’m really shocked. Uniform police officers all over the place, the lights are flashing, the driver’s stilljumped? That’s the sort of thing that goes on. The driver tells police he’s in a rush to get to work, but checks reveal he’s driving without either a full licence or insurance, so his car is seized. ",,

On BBC London: Brain damaged after suffering a heart attack on the pitch - a Spurs striker wins the right to sue the club. And overcrowding and cancellations - London commuters are the least satisfied in the country. Good evening. Egyptian warplanes have attacked so-called Islamic State targets in Libya in response to the abduction and beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians who’d travelled to Libya to find work. State TV said the dawn strikes had targeted camps, training sites and weapons storage areas in the militant held city of Derna. More than half of the Egyptians killed by IS were from one village - Al-our. From there our Cairo Correspondent Orla Guerin has sent this report. Under cover of darkness, Egyptian warplanes setting out for a bombing mission inside Libya. Swift retribution for the beheading of Coptic Christians and the opening of a new battlefront in the Middle East. State TV aired what it said was cockpit video of Egyptian missiles hitting militant training camps. Cairo wants the international community to join in, targeting Islamic State here, as in Syria and Iraq. Here is the grief behind the Egyptian air strikes. In the village of Al-our, the streets echoed with anguish today. This small community has lost 13 men. She cries out for her beloved ones. Five of her relatives are gone. In a nearby house, more torment. Relatives hold aloft photos of two brothers in their 20s, who hoped for a better life in Libya. In the church they prayed for men shown no mercy. Coptic Christians are a minority in Egypt and often complain of neglect. Some here say the government didn’t do enough to save their sons and brothers. Unable to scratch out a living, they went in search of casual labour across the porous border. Relatives say that the men were driven from their homes here in the village by grinding poverty and lack of work. They followed a well trodden path to Libya. It’s the only option for many desperate Egyptians, and locals here tell us that in spite of what has happened, men from this area will continue to make that journey. We could go to Libya tomorrow, this man says, and the day after. People prefer to die there than to live here. Egypt is facing new losses and new dangers. There are risks in getting embroiled in conflict across the border. Orla Guerin, BBC News. Islamic State extremists have exploited a power vacuum in Libya after the fall of Colonel Gaddafi and started building a power base there, as well as in Iraq and Syria. Now Egypt’s ambassador to the UK says the proximity of Libya to Italy means the threat from Islamic State is closer to home than many people in Europe might think. Here’s our Diplomatic Correspondent james Robbins. Of course, we’re used to the idea of so-called IS - Islamic State - being in Iraq and Syria where the movement is thought to have up to 30,000 fighters operating in both countries. It’s now very clear IS is in Libya too, spreading its influence in that ungovernable country which borders Egypt. The IS stronghold is the city of Derna, but they are only one of hundreds of militias vying for power in Libya, a country torn apart by factionalism. It’s a very far cry from the country which Britain and France thought they had helped save less than four years ago. David Cameron and the then French President Nicolas Sarkozy jointly celebrated with the Libyans of Benghazi after leading Western air strikes which saved the city and helped bring down Colonel Gaddafi, a ruthless dictator. Colonel Gaddafi said he would hunt you down like rats, but you showed the courage of lions, and we salute your courage. This is the moment David Cameron told them that the Arab Spring could become the Arab Summer- but instead what followed? The rebels turned on each other, Libya simply fell apart. Fast forward three and a half years, and this is Benghazi last month, a city largely undamaged in the revolution to bring down Gaddafi, now ruined by those same rebels killing each other, as some of literally hundreds of rival militias fight for control of a collapsing state. Ina In a speech tonight, the former head of MI6 was blunt. After Colonel Gadaffi was ousted, there was no one to hold the ring to help manage a transition to something better. Libya had no institutions. Who or what would take over? The answer, those with the weapons. The result, growing chaos, exploited by fanatics. Amid civil war and with two rival Libyan governments, one recognised international and one not, the extremists of Islamic State saw their chance and started building their own base inside Libya. Last month, suicide bombers got into the Carinthia, one of Tripoli’s luxury hotels, used by foreign visitors. Islamic State claimed it was their work, as proof that they can even reach into the capital city. Those pressing for military action are pointing to this, the latest pictures of boat people trying for a better life in Europe. This weekend, more than 2000 were rescued in the Mediterranean by the Italian coastguard. Egypt says the exodus poses a new threat now that Islamic State controls the Libyan coastal town of Sirt. It is 300 kilometres from Italy. Those boat people that move for economic purposes, in the next three weeks, if we do not act, it will be full of terrorists. How will the West respond? There is zero appetite for military action in Libya. David Cameron is sending strong signals from Downing Street, the only hope is to get Libya’s rivals to talk, not fight. But success in that looks very remote. A captured Islamic State suicide bomber has told the BBC that the group actively recruits teenagers as young as 14 to carry out attacks in Iraq. The bomber was caught in Baghdad, where security is improving as IS is pushed back from areas around the city. It’s giving the city a new lease of life. From there our World Affairs Editor, john Simpson, reports. This is turning into a different city. The night-time curfew, which lasted for years, has finally been lifted and people can enjoy themselves, like they used to years ago. Still, everyone knows it’s not 100% safe. Islamic State, self-styled, marked the lifting of the curfew with suicide bombings. But the police are getting better at stopping them. And this is a suicide bomber, just captured. We were given remarkable access to film him. He’s only 17 - just a boy - homeless and vulnerable. IS showed him how to wear an explosives vest with his thumb on the trigger. TRANSLATION: They promised me I’d go straight to heaven. The majority of recruits are like me or younger. Younger? How young? 11+,15,16 or17, like me. And you were fully prepared to kill women and children as well as men? Yes, sir. Why are you crying now? Because I’m so sorry for this. You’re ashamed of what you were going to do? Yes, sir. There’s no sign that he is saying this because he’s been mistreated. Now he’ll serve time in prison. After that, he could still have a decent future. Police in Baghdad have also had some success against car bombs. Each checkpoint has a list of suspicious vehicles police are the lookout for. Brigadier Saad Maan of the Interior Ministry is remarkably upbeat. Are you winning this war? I’m fully confident to say yes. We are winning the war. And we have hope and we have faith that this year will be the end of Daesh in Iraq. A few months ago, there were still fears that IS, or Daesh, might capture Baghdad itself. You don’t hear that now, and IS is being pushed back in the country as a whole. But the new Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, is well aware that Iraq’s third city, Mosul, is still in IS hands. I can announce this. We have already started the preparation for the liberation of Mosul. We’ve already started this. So we are assigning sections of our army divisions to that task, and other security forces. Mosul will be back in your hands by the end of the year? I hope so, we are working on a bit before that. Is his optimism justified? After all, last week IS scored a victory in western Iraq. But it isn’t as strong as it was, while the government forces are stronger. For the first time in years, there are reasons to be optimistic here. The ceasefire in eastern Ukraine is looking increasingly fragile - just a day after it was meant to start. The Ukrainian military command said pro-Russian rebels had attacked 112 times since early yesterday, and the rebels, who hold Donetsk airport, accused Ukrainian forces of shelling it. From there, our International Correspondent Ian Pannell and cameraman Fred Scott, sent this report. A warning, their report contains images some viewers may find distressing. This is what a scorched earth policy actually looks like - barely recognisable from what it is. Donetsk International Airport. A symbol of the searing intensity of the war in Ukraine that’s supposed to have stopped. A battle that pitches a Western-leaning government against a rebel army that turns to its neighbour, Russia. So this is day two of a shaky cease-fire and heavy weapons are supposed to be pulled back. But that isn’t what’s happening here. The rebel Defence Minister says he’ll only pull his forces back when he has proof that the Ukrainians on this front line have withdrawn theirs. But the issue that threatens this peace deal isn’t that the guns haven’t pulled back here, it’s that they’re still firing. This is supposed to be day two of the cease-fire in eastern Ukraine and as we’ve been hearing... EXPLOSION. ..the peace has not settled in. We’ve been hearing the consistent sound of artillery fire... That’s another one. Most of it appears to be outgoing. The Donetsk People’s Republic are saying they are suppressing fire... Run! Run! Run! The Ukrainians insist they haven’t broken the truce, accusing the rebels of shelling their own territory. That’s firing out. No, it’s in and out. The Defence Minister says he’s tried to stop the enemy from firing at their positions. But more than 5,000 people have been killed in this war. We saw other bodies at the airport, too gruesome to show. The last effort to stop this war failed and this is where it really broke down. Today’s peace deal has held in most places, but there’s a clear risk that what we’re watching is history repeating itself. Greece bailout talks have broken down after Athens rejected what they called ""unacceptable"" demands. Eurozone finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, have told Greece that it now has until Friday to agree to strict conditions for extending its bailout programme. Our Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt, is in Brussels. It was billed as a showdown. It pitted the Greek finance minister against the rest of the eurozone. He wanted an end to the bailout agreement and new bridging finance, but the reception was decidedly cool. Early signs were not good. This was the powerful German finance minister. He accused Athens of behaving quite irresponsibly. TRANSLATION: What I have heard so far has not strengthened my optimism. The Greek finance minister believed he had been offered a loan agreement to tide them over the months ahead. But in the meeting, Greece was told it had to request an extension of the existing bailout, with strict austerity conditions. The Greeks called that unreasonable and unacceptable. And then afterwards, the Greeks were bluntly told the ball was in their court. They had until Friday to request an extension of the existing bailout programme or they were on their own. It is up to the Greek authorities now to decide whether they would want such an extension, whether they would take up the offer to look for the flexibility within the programme. The Greek finance minister was defiant. In the history of the European Union, nothing good has ever come out of ultimata. Last night, 15,000 people were on the streets of Athens, urging the government to stand firm against a programme of austerity. But if there is no compromise, the current bailout will expire at the end of the month and shortly after, Greece could run out of money. So tonight the Greek government faces a stark choice. Either it has to request an extension of the existing bailout by Friday or it’s on its own in meeting its debt commitments. The Greek finance minister tonight wasn’t all pessimistic. He believed there could be progress within the next A8 hours. A lot of it, he said, would come down to a question of wording. In the meantime, Greece’s banks are bleeding deposits at a rate of 2 billion euros a week. 30,000 people have attended a vigil in Copenhagen tonight to remember the victims of the weekend’s shootings. Earlier, two men appeared in court accused of hiding the suspected killer, and helping him dispose of a weapon. Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, is in Copenhagen. Outside this cafe, as far as the eye could see, there were people. The Prince and the politicians came, but this was about ordinary Danes here to grieve, cry and to express defiance. But also perhaps to access that the feelings of security in this country have been shaken and perhaps shaken further as new details emerged about the suspected gunman, the man suspected of the attacks at the cafe and at the synagogue. Streaming in theirtens of thousands, the streets that had been shut down by terror now we claimed. They came to stand together outside the cafe where those whose good for free speech had been attacked. Come out here to show my sympathy for what happened in Copenhagen. To stand up for those who died. And to show that it’s not OK. Named by local media as the gunmen, Omar el-Hussein, is a black shorts, showing his aggression in the ring. The 22-year-old, a gang member, had onlyjust come out of prison for violence. Prison authorities had identified him as having radical views while inside. Martin, a former Danish soldier, was a classmate, saddened but not surprised about the attacks. He has well-known radical views. I am absolutely sure that they knew. Absolutely sure, I have no doubt in mY Absolutely sure, I have no doubt in my mind. The people in my classroom. I know that people called him. And told the police about his views? Yes. Today he, two men were charged with helping the suspected gunmen. They are charged with hiding the firearm and providing shelter for the perpetrator and they are denying the charges. The suspected gunman murdered film-maker Finn Norgaard at a cafe holding a meeting on free speech, and Dan Uzan, an economist who was a volunteer guard at the synagogue. Dan Uzan had been protecting Hannah and her family and friends, who were celebrating her bat mitzvah, her coming of age ceremony. They ended the night barricaded in a panic room. My main focus was keeping the children calm and safe. Was the door bullet-proof? What is going to happen next? How am I going to explain this to my children? And how... What will I say to his parents? To the security guard’s parents? Although grateful to the policemen who were also injured, they believe there should have been greater security. But the Prime Minister doesn’t believe the attacks were part of a wider terrorist network. But I want to also make very clear that we have no indication, at this stage, that he was part of a cell. That took him to where he is now. Denmark is defiant, but nervous. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. A man from Liverpool has been charged with attempting to obtain a chemical weapon. 31-year-old Mohammed Ammer Ali was arrested following a joint raid by North West Counter Terrorism Unit and Merseyside Police. He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court tomorrow. The disgraced cyclist, Lance Armstrong, has been ordered to pay more than £6.5 million in damages to an insurance company in Dallas. He was found to have lied about his use of performance-enhancing drugs during a lawsuit against SCA Promotions. Visitors are being stopped from going to hospitals in Herefordshire, in an attempt to prevent the spread of norovirus. The Wye Valley NHS Trust says hospitals have admitted 20% more patients in the last week, partly due to the virus. Some non-emergency operations have also been cancelled. Every school leaver in England will be guaranteed an apprenticeship if Labour wins the general election, as long as they get the right grades. Ed Miliband said Labour would create at least 80,000 new apprenticeships by 2020. But the Conservatives said their own plans included putting a further three million people onto the schemes. Our political correspondent, Ben Wright, has more. A growing business in a growing economy. As Labour bashes out its manifesto plans for business, it’s companies like this that need convincing. For me, they should focus on infrastructure, transport, training. All the things we know we have a shortfall in, particularly around this area, where transport connectivity is a real issue. If they can help us with that, then businesses will take the risk. We’re quite good at creating opportunities and taking advantage of them. So today at jaguar Land Rover, Ed Miliband set out his party’s stall- repeating promises to cut business rates promises to freeze business rates and keep Britain within the EU. And there was a new pledge on apprenticeships. I think we need a better plan, to replace an economy where tens of billions are lost in tax avoidance, an economy where tens of thousands more of our young people get apprenticeships. We need a better plan to help millions more businesses grow, succeed and create wealth. Labour says they’ll guarantee an extra 80,000 on-the-job training places by 2020, open to young people with the equivalent of two A-levels. The party’s recent attack on tax avoidance drew the Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, into a row about trimming the garden hedge. He said people should seek a receipt for a cashjob, no matter how small. Do you think it’s always wrong for small businesses to accept cash in hand for work? What’s important is that people pay their fair share of taxes. That’s what counts. The hedge funds and hedge funds dealing with these issues is more important than the hedge cutters and I think that has been a clarity of view right across our Shadow Cabinet. The Conservatives said Labour didn’t understand how business works. Ed Miliband, I have to say, who’s never run a business in his life, who’s never run anything but politics in his life, is the last person in the world we should be listening to on this. He wants to destroy business. Some business groups said today’s plan from Labour was a welcome change in tone. With the election tight and economic credibility key, Ed Miliband seems to have found his pro-business voice. While the Tories say they’ll run the economy more efficiently and Labour say they’ll run it more fairly, companies like this simply say they are hoping for stabililty.

And when Cromwell met Luther. Mark Rylance and Idris Elba brave the rain for their latest Hollywood movie. Plus, a look ahead to this week’s weather. Your local and national forecast coming up. Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. A Premier League football club is tonight facing a multi-million pound payout to a former player who was left brain damaged after suffering a heart attack on the pitch. Radwan Hamed, who was 17 at the time, was playing his first game as a professional for Tottenham Hotspur when he collapsed in 2006. A High Courtjudge said the club had failed him in their duty of care. Arriving at the High Court today, the parents of Radwan Hamed, They have been seeking hunters for nearly nine years. He signed a professional contract for Spurs in 2006. Nine years -- professional contract for Spurs in 2006. Nine years -- days later, he suffered a cardiac arrest and was left brain damaged. Today is a good day for the truth. Very emotional still. I can feel it. We are going back years. It is hard, standing here. Year before his collapse coming he was sent by Spurs for a routine screening. The cardiologist sported an abnormality and recommended that Spurs carry out an MRI scan and a clinical review. The head of Tottenham’s medical Department failed to ensure a clinical review took place. No one told him about his abnormal ECG. Forget football. He could have been a strong man, an able man. He could have gone through university like his two sisters. He could have had a life, a girlfriend, a properjob. That is all taken away from him. The judge a properjob. That is all taken away from him. Thejudge ruled from him. The judge ruled that both Dr Mills and Tottenham medical staff had failed in their duty of care. When it came to question of apportionment, the judge ruled that Dr Mills was 30% liable for what happened to Radwan. He said Tottenham were 70% liable. On receiving the judgement regarding liability, top -- Tottenham said: One former player who survived a cardiac arrest on the pitch, believes top clubs and the sport in general still need to do more. 52 footballers have died in the last I5 years within the game of football. It is almost like more deaths need to occur before this is taken seriously enough. When he took to the field for Tottenham, Radwan Hamed thought he was embarking on a dream career. No one had told him he might have a serious heart condition. One which meant it was not safe to play. One which ruined his life. Chris is here now. Where does this go from here for the family and football? Thejudge go from here for the family and football? The judge today, football? Thejudge today, having ruled that Tottenham’s medics and the cardiologist were negligent, the family can now seek damages. It is thought that Radwan’s solicitors will seek in the region of £5 million to £6 million. That’s the cost of the rehabilitation he has at to date. He has regained some vision and speech, but he can never live independently. They will also seek the cost of ongoing care. Also, the loss of career earnings. The family say they would never have allowed him to play professional football if they knew he had a serious heart condition, but they are quite sure he would have gone to university and had a successful career. There are also questions for football. As we heard in that piece, the only mandatory heart screening in football happens when you are I6. It is the one that Radwan had. In his case, it was the fault of nobody telling him he had an abnormal ECG that ultimately led to his collapse, if mandatory annual screenings were in place, he may well have had another one, in the I3 months between his first ECG and the time of his collapse. Commuters in London and south-east are the least satisfied in the country according to a survey by Which. Southern was the worst for delays and Thameslink scored badly on satisfaction levels. The government insists it is record amounts in the rail network. Apart from two delays to Southern services, it has been running smoothly. As most commuters know, thatis smoothly. As most commuters know, that is not always the case. This survey asked 7000 passengers in London and the south-east about theirjourneys over the last 12 months. How did the rail operators do? Delays, poor value for money and dirty toilets. According to the latest train satisfaction survey by Which, passengers aren’t happy. 29% of all rail passengers suffered a delay when they last travelled. Southern were worst for delays, with 39% of customers saying they were held up on their lastjourney. And when it came to overall satisfaction, Thameslink and First Capital Connect scored the lowest, with just 43% of passengers saying they were happy with their service. Commuters in London are saying loud and clear they are fed up paying through the nose with dirty, old, overcrowded and later trains. through the nose for dirty, old, overcrowded and late trains. It is completely unacceptable, as the costs of travelling by rail are spiralling. These are the sorts of conditions that people are being asked to endure. The figures in the Which report differ significantly from the industry’s own passenger surveys, which suggest that 81% of Train users are satisfied with their service. that 81% of train users are satisfied with their service. When you compare the services that we have here in the UK, compared to overseas, yes, the trains might not be on time a lot of the time, or not even a lot of the time, but sometimes in a lot of countries there is no time for the train. You just rock up and you might be waiting a few hours to get a train anywhere. The population is overcrowded, there are two many people. there are to many people. Especially when you want to go to work, you got other places to go to. Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail operators, told us: Meanwhile, Southern believes that the major development works at London Bridge are partly responsible for their poor performance in the survey. Despite the findings in today’s report, new figures show that passenger numbers have actually grown by 16% in the last four years. Well, another big issue the survey found was compensation. Three quarters of passengers in the survey who had been delayed for more than an hour didn’t know there were entitled to compensation. From speaking to commuters here tonight, it seems these problems are not new. They say they have the same things year after year, They say they have the same things yearafteryear, but year after year, but nothing seems to be done. Smoking the most potent forms of cannabis is being linked to almost a quarter of new cases of psychosis. Research from Kings College London suggests the risk of getting the mental health condition, which can include paranoia and delusions, is three times higher for users of skunk-like cannabis than for people who use a milder form of the drug. Plans for a major revamp of Alexandra Palace have been given the go-ahead tonight. Haringey Council has approved proposals for a £28 million refurbishment. It’ll include a new museum dedicated to the BBC studios - and restoration of the Victorian theatre. They’re perhaps an unlikely duo - one is the theatre actor currently playing Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall - the other known for his role as TV detective Luther. But tonight Mark Rylance and Idris Elba shared the red carpet for the premiere of their latest film The Gunman. They’ve been speaking to our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus about why London talent is doing so well in Hollywood. Why are you here? Someone tried to kill me three days ago. It’s the latest offering from Sean Penn, taking on a producer and leading role in the action thriller The Gunman. This big-screen adaptation of a novel byjean-Patrick Manchette, also features a host of London talent, including Ray Winstone, Idris Elba and Mark Rylance. What was it that made you think this is a project I’ll give my time too, I really want to be part of? Sean, I like Sean. Yeah. As simple as that? I second that. He’s a movie legend. So it’s a great opportunity to do something different with him. He’s doing something different, it was great to be asked. We understand you have some information? Do you want to tell us where it is? The Gunman was shot in multiple locations, including here in the capital. It’s a high octane adventure with an international cast and continues Hollywood’s love affair with British talent. To be honest, I think English actors have always been in Hollywood and always had a presence. At the moment, there is a slew of great actors, American, Australian, English, otherwise. It’sjust a good time to have a really great talent, you know? I think Hollywood is opening up its doors to outside of American stories, other stories as well. We are seeing a slew of different actors come through. It’s not only the actors, I noticed a lot of English technicians when I go on film sets, in all fields, make-up, camera, lighting. All the different fields. English craftspeople have a way of doing theirjobs very well with a lot of good humour. And that’s a really important thing, because the hours are long, the work is quite intense. Good banter! Mark Rylance is also thrilling audiences with his engaging performance on the small screen, in the television adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s novels, Wolf Hall. He will hit the big screen again, starring Stephen Spielberg’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Big Friendly Giant. He’s renowned for his amazing theatre, are we likely to see you on the London stage? I’d like to get back to theatre. I’ve done a little bit here and there. I think the last time I was at the Donmar. Yes, I would love to get back. It’s just finding the time and the right project. This versatile duo agree The Gunman was a fitting project for them both. And the results can be seen when the film is released this March. That’s it from me, so I’ll say goodnight and hand you over to Wendy Hurrell for the weather. How’s this week looking? The weather for the week ahead will be somewhat mixed. We will have sunshine returning tomorrow. There will be sunny spells midweek before it turns more unsettled towards the end of the week. Less certain in the forecast. This cloud has been surging towards us. You can see the lovely clear where we will have tomorrow. At the moment, the cloud is produced in some rain, and has done for a good few hours. Heavy bursts is, but you can see it on the radar, moving very quickly away to the East. As we go to the next few hours it will become dry. The sky will begin to clear. Across Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, temperatures will be low enough for a touch of frost. They aware, there might be one or two ice patches first thing tomorrow morning. Beautiful sunshine through the day. Temperatures reaching between seven and 9 degrees. The wind will be falling light through the day. It leads us into a pretty cold night.

Thursday and Friday and we get this weather front that is going through at some point. But it does look like it will be a little uncertain for the time being. A breezy spell. As for the weekend, it stays pretty breezy. We are going to have some pretty high tides. At least we are not working at enormous amounts of snow. Hello. The UK snow lovers, peering into the weather for the week ahead, you will find little encouragement. You can only look on with envy as to what is happening on the north-west of the USA and eastern Canada. Piles of snow. This is Boston. It’s a cold, the local weather office there says that by midnight, of the 384 hours that make UP midnight, of the 384 hours that make up the month so far, a staggering 28 have have the temperature at or above freezing. There is no relief this week. More bitter cold and snow to come. In our run of the mill winter, the best I can offer is widespread frost tonight. Still some rain around across East Anglia and parts of the south-east. A few more hours before that clears away. One oche showers dotted about. Widgery in north-west Scotland. A slither of rain, sleet and snow. -- in north-west Scotland. A slither of rain, sleet and snow. -- wintry. Elsewhere, it is notjust dry. It is clear. Temperatures are dipping away and it is always good to be colder away from town and city centres, rural spots and the suburbs. The frost setting in, a few icy patches on untreated surfaces. The compensation for the cold staff will be plenty of sunshine across England and Wales to start the day, running UP and Wales to start the day, running up through eastern Scotland. Light wind across southern areas. Temperatures recover. With sunshine in the afternoon, thoughts of spring, ratherthan in the afternoon, thoughts of spring, rather than winter. spring, ratherthan winter. Cloud will increase in Cumbria. Through western Scotland, at this stage, not much in the way of rain. Showers in the far north of Scotland retreating to the Northern Isles. As we go through the day we are going to see some rain developing in western Scotland, particularly argyle northwards. The start of a prolonged spell of rain here that will go into Wednesday. Not much rain from the cloud in Northern Ireland. Some spot in the Cumbrian fells. Southern and eastern parts of the UK still have sunny spells. A touch of frost across southern parts to start the day on Wednesday. From the cloud, some outbreaks of rain towards the north-west, most persistent in western Scotland. Temperatures a little bit higher, sunny breaks to the south and east. The rain starts to move south on Thursday. Parts of England and Wales getting into the brighter conditions. Temperatures coming down a little bit. The DOT BRANNING: ‘Murder. 'It’s such an ugly word, ain’t it? 'So black, so frightening...' just tell me. Whatever it is, we can sort it out together. 'The thought that one human being 'could be capable of ending another human life, 'just like that, like it was nothing.' I found something out. How she died.

Roxy and Ronnie, that’s where they had the car crash. Phil Mitchell, he was shot over there. Bradley Branning fell off that roof, and I am told this is where Tiffany cracked her actual skull. Ahh! Mind you, tonight it’s like a ghost town. I wonder where everyone is. Maybe they’re in the Queen Vic. ",,

Later on BBC London: Growing calls for compensation over the huge sinkhole in Hemel Hempstead. And after all that rain it’s a sunny afternoon for London - a full forecast coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Inflation has fallen to its lowest level on record. The Consumer Price measure of inflation was 0.3% for the year to january - down from its level of 0.5% in December. The tumble reflects a slide in global oil prices, which last month fell to their lowest level in almost six years at below $45 a barrel. And a supermarket price war has led to lower food prices. Here’s our economics correspondent Andy Verity. To find out what falling prices might mean, just focus on those parts of the economy that have dealt with it for years. When Steve went into business 25 years ago you might make £100 profit margin selling a top of the range camera. After years of price falls you would be lucky to make £15. Injanuary, the price of cameras fell faster than almost any category except fuel. Allergens are squeezed and squeezed. Many cameras, you’re making 1% to 5% -- margins are squeezed and squeezed. This is crazy, cameras go up to Âl+500. I would advise people not to go into this business! I don’t think you can make a living. With prices falling fast about costs, neither Steve nor his staff have had a pay rise since the recession began. He can’t afford it. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index,is measured by the consumer prices index, is at its lowest on record, 0.3%. The price of petrol and diesel was down 30.8% compared to one year ago, food was down by 2.8%. Three months ago, this camera would have cost you £1100, but when the new model came out it dropped to less than £700. By waiting, you can save ÂlIoo. We are used to that happening with cameras, will we get used to it across the whole economy? Good deflation is when falling inflation is caused by falling energy or food prices, so it puts money back into households, meaning they have more discretionary income. But deflation happens when it becomes ingrained, people expect prices to keep falling and they put up spending because they think the price will fall further, consumer spending drops and we get into a recessionary situation. Do we expect prices to fall? Not all of us, not yet. They will probably go up as usual. They will probably fall. I would like to think they carry on falling. They are always going up. Hopefully. But who can tell? When we expect falling prices we might not put off buying, especially if we are keen enough to have the latest product. But for businesses like this, falling prices make it much harder to stay in business. A record low, how much lower can it go? Quite a lot, if you believe the governor of the Bank of England. He said last week it could turn negative, temporarily, which is the key. We expect the big drop in the price of fuel to feed through to other products, which could happen over the next few months. The Bank of England says that you can expect a minus inflation number in the spring sometime, they don’t know if it will be March, April or what, but that should be temporarily because the big drop in the price of fuel only feeds through to one year’s figures, after that is over is no longer brings the prices down and they think there will be upward pressure on wages, which should mean inflation and wages will bounce back towards the end of the year. But what they are forecasting does not always match up to reality. If you want to calculate your own inflation rate, just head to the website on screen now. Two men have been arrested in connection with a lorry crash in Bath in which four people, including a four-year-old girl, died. The 19-year-old driver of a tipper truck has been detained on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He and a 28- year-old man have also been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence. Our correspondent Andrew Plant is in Bath for us. We are just at the bottom of Lansdown Lane in Bath, the scene of the terrible crash almost one week ago today, at around lipm last Monday. Over my shoulder you might see the red bollards at the top of the hill, where workmen are trying to rebuild the walls that were completely smashed to pieces as the truck careered out of control out of the hill almost one week ago today. People living nearby reported that the time hearing a Longhorn blast coming from the 32 tonne cheaper drugs, suggesting, they said, that the driver was trying to warn people that he had lost control -- the driver was trying to warn people that he had lost control -- 32 tonne truck. As it was, the tipper truck collided with four-year-old Mitzi Steady, as she crossed the road with her grandmother. Mitzi Steady died instantly, her grandmother is still in hospital. The tipper truck turned over on top of a Volvo car, which had three men on their way to Wales inside. They were also all killed instantly. Four people lost their lives last Monday. There is a widespread assumption that there was some kind of mechanical failure, like a brake failure, on-board, but today’s news raises a different possibility. Two men, aged 19 and 28, have been arrested and are being questioned on suspicion of causing manslaughter by gross negligence, the 19-year-old is being questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Neither has been named, but we know that the 19-year-old is local man Philip Potter. Forthis 19-year-old is local man Philip Potter. For this closely knit community, this suburb on the outskirts of Bath, waking up today to the possibility that there might have been other factors involved, police are investigating the possibility of negligence. The Greek government says it’s confident that a deal with its creditors in the Eurozone can be reached, despite the collapse of talks last night after it rejected the conditions for extending its bailout. Eurozone finance ministers have given the country’s anti-austerity government until Friday to agree. There’s concern that Greece could run out of money and be forced out of the Euro. Our Europe correspondent Gavin Lee is in Brussels. One of the main headlines in the Greek newspaper this morning is 96 hours until an agreement or accident for Greece. This imposed deadline on Friday, if Greece do not agree to their existing bailout proposals, on February the 28th it will expire, and a few weeks after that, Greece could run out of money. If any pressure was being felt by the charismatic finance minister, he was not letting it show as he arrived in Brussels. The showdown continues, and this is the man taking on the rest of the Eurozone. He has three days to find a way to solve the Greek debt crisis, and the finance minister still hopes a new deal could be negotiated. Europe will continue to deliberate in order to enhance the chances are that actually achieving a very good outcome for the average European. That the average Greek, not for the average Dutch person or the average German. We know in your power to deliberate in such a way as to create a good solution and an honourable solution out of initial disagreement. But the other key player does not see it that way. The head of the Aura group has told the Greeks they have until Friday to decide whether to take the existing bailout programme face the consequences. This morning as EU finance ministers met in Brussels, he was not rolling back on that ultimatum. They can put their political priorities, we’ll see whether the programme remains on track, but that is the way forward. It really is up to the Greeks. We cannot make them, or we will not ask them. It is really up to them. We stand ready to work with them. What about the rest of Europe and the fallout if Greece goes its own way? British chancellor George Osborne is one of many ministers aware from -- well aware of the possibilities of the dangers of a Greek Eurozone exit. We are reaching crunch time for Greece and the Eurozone. I urge all sides to reach an agreement, because the consequences of not having one would be very severe for economic and financial stability. We have a long-term economic plan in Britain and we can better protect ourselves, but Britain needs to see competence, not chaos. In the past few days, thousands of Greeks have turned out onto the streets of Athens, urging the government to stand firm against austerity. I am very worried that Greece is probably going to leave Europe due to all the situation. I am going to leave Europe due to all the situation. Iam not situation. I am not worried. We are watching theatre in action. Nothing will change. Newspapers that speak of an will change. Newspapers that speak ofan agreement of an agreement or an accident, but unless a compromise is reached, Greece could run out of money. George Osborne is calling at crunch time for Greece, is it? Yes. You speak to any minister in Brussels and they will speak about the importance of this deadline and is an agreement being reached. It is notable that there are very few people, noted by the silence, really, saying that they understand the Greek situation. The Spanish government, who are quite conservative, are siding with Germany. That is because they have their own election. This could unravel the Eurozone. George Osborne says it has to be sorted out within three days. The clock carries on ticking. Thank you. The Ukrainian government says fierce fighting is continuing in the east of the country, as the new ceasefire appears to be failing. But rebels in one of the two regions held by pro-Russian forces claim they are pulling back their heavy weapons, in accordance with the ceasefire deal. jonny Dymond has the latest. In the bleak midwinter on Europe’s eastern border, Ukraine’s war continues. There is meant to be a cease-fire. But around the embattled town of Debaltseve, there is little sign of anything approaching peace. Debaltseve has been fought over for weeks. There are thousands of Ukrainian government soldiers inside it, a ring of rebel troops and hardware around it. Weapons and soldiers circle the town. Now the railway station, strategically important to the rebels, is being fought over and street fighting has broken out. This war has claimed almost 5,500 lives. The cease-fire agreement was supposed to stop more bloodshed, but Debaltseve, just outside rebel territory, but linking the two big cities the rebels do control, is too tempting a target. The group that is supposed to be monitoring the cease-fire can only remind the two sides what they signed up to. This cease-fire should not be partial, should not be half-hearted, not conditioned, but it should be fully and comprehensively as the Minsk document said. To the south, little sign of any cease-fire. Here, government forces have been pushing up rebel lines for days, trying to drive the separatists away from another strategic town. Across the front line, both sides try to press home their advantage. Outside Debaltseve, a pipeline is hit. Maybe an accident, maybe a lucky shot for one side or another. The cease-fire that never really took hold is under almost impossible strain. Our correspondent David Stern is in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. With the latest news coming out of the region, the cease-fire, as we heard, is getting more and more fragile by the hour? Exactly. It remains to be seen how much more pressure and fragility there will be before the cease-fire completely breaks down. It should be said, there are glimmers of hope. As you have said before, one of the two rebel republics has said that they have started to withdraw heavy artillery. We cannot confirm, but if thatis artillery. We cannot confirm, but if that is happening that is a move in the right direction. There are other places that are apparently quiet, but the fighting is continuing in a number of places, most, in particular, the area mentions in that report. There is no street fighting taking place. It is difficult to say what the state of affairs is. The rebels say they have taken over the town, the government forces say that is not true, but it is true that this is a very fierce fight. The question is, obviously, what will happen next if this breaks down? Is there going to be full-scale fighting in the east, as we saw before, and if that happens, what will the West to do about the violence? Our top story this lunchtime: Inflation is now at its lowest level in history. Lower prices at the pumps - and a supermarket price war- have taken it down to 0.3%. A fireball in the snow, as a train carrying crude oil bursts into flames, close to homes in the United States. In sport: Scotland fall to New Zealand by three wickets in the opening game. Scotland’s next game is against England on Monday. The Bishops of the Church of England have just released a letter, urging Anglicans to take an active part in the General Election in May. It’s the first letter of its kind from the Church leadership, and calls for politicians to think of the common good, and to show a ‘fresh moral vision’ at a time when many voters appear disillusioned with politics. The Bishop of Leicester wants to challenge the idea that Britain is becoming a nation of strangers. We speak about Britain as a community, of communities. We challenge the idea that we are becoming a nation of strangers. We are concerned about scapegoating those who are on welfare benefits, those who may be migrants from Europe orfrom the former British Commonwealth. In my own city of Leicester, we have an extremely diverse community. I know we can live creatively and in harmony, but the signs of the fabric cracking are worrying and we want people to think more carefully about it. Our religious affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, is at Westminster. It looks like bishops getting involved in politics, is it? They say, yes, they are with this letter, 50 pages worth of it, that they want to stimulate debate and give their parishioners ideas, things that they should ask their political party candidates as they come round and try and help shape the political discourse. The bishops are worried about public disenchantment with politics. They are saying here are some of the big ideas, these are the things you should be thinking about. They say they worry about politics at a time of widening economic inequality and the fabric of society, in some areas, they say, is cracking. They asked people whether they wish to debate the future of Trident, and also Britain’s place in Europe. They also back the idea of a living wage, saying millions in work are still suffering poverty, that that has to be one of the things that people think about. They worry about too much power being concentrated in the state or in companies, in big business. They call on people, on parties, to avoid scapegoating any community, whether thatis scapegoating any community, whether that is the unemployed, those on benefits or immigrants. They are asking people to think about the big questions, to try to come together as communities so that Britain can come together as a bigger community. They say none of this is party political, although some people within those parties may think they are. They want big ideas as Britain had in the elections of 191+5 or 1979, where big issues were at stake and where people were making big decisions. They want all political parties to think about the poor, the sick, the vulnerable and not to exclude them. David Cameron has given his response saying he’s welcoming anyone intervening in the debate. Thank you. An estimated 50,000 unemployed young people would have to do community work from the minute they claim benefit if a Conservative Government is elected in May. The plan goes further than the Tories’ existing proposal, under which young claimants must begin community work after six months on benefits. David Cameron says he wants to abolish long-term youth unemployment, as our political correspondent, Carole Walker, reports. You will have to work for your benefits. That was the message to young jobless claimants from the Prime Minister. Underthe Prime Minister. Under the Conservatives, Prime Minister. Underthe Conservatives, 18 to 21-year-olds, who have not been working or learning for six months, will have to help local charities or look after the elderly without pay to get a new youth allowance. All the evidence shows that work experience, getting up, having a job, going to a place of work regularly, is a good way of giving people the experience, the training and the life skills so they can go on for a life of work. The Government has already tightened the rules but the Tories say they’d go further, lowering the overall benefit cap, withdrawing housing benefit from many young people, and cutting payments to claimants with obesity or drug problems who refuse treatment. So what about compulsory work for benefits? These were some views from County Durham. You have to do something to get something. That is what they should do. My brother sits in the house waiting for people to offer him jobs and he gets money for nothing. They should do something. They should be getting help to get a job. Not to, like, be on the dole and suffer. Today’s announcements are the latest measure intended to show the Conservatives would take a tough approach to welfare, making it harder for people to choose to live on benefits. The Tories believe it will prove popular, with those who are working to pay for the system, and they need to find ways of saving £12 billion from the welfare bill in the next Parliament. Ed Miliband said Labour would give young unemployed people more training and a six-monthjob paid by the taxpayer if they have been out of work for a year. We have to give our young people a chance to have proper education and training. We can’t shove them into inappropriate work and hope they stay in it. The latest figures show that while the economy is growing and more people are getting jobs, youth unemployment has risen sharply to more than three-quarters of a million. Ministers are being urged to make sex education compulsory in every state primary and secondary school in England. The Commons’ Education Committee says it would ensure that enough time was devoted to the subject, and that teachers were properly trained. jon Brain has this report. Their world is very different from the one their parents grew up in. But are they learning the tools they’ll need to navigate the complexities of modern-day sex and relationships? Pornography on the Internet and sexual images spread by social media have thrown up new challenges, while the introduction of same-sex marriages is also changing society. The Select Committee believes children should be getting advice from primary school onwards. We need age-appropriate sex education in our schools. It should be done in conjunction with parents. We suggest there should be an obligation on schools to consult and work with parents to make sure they’re happy with what is being provided. The report follows an Ofsted inquiry which found that teaching of sex and relationships wasn’t good enough in 1+0% of schools. But there is some opposition to making the subject compulsory for primary school children. The Family Education Trust says: ""It’s not often age appropriate. Children develop at different ages. They have different levels of maturity. It would be our recommendation that parents always check what’s being taught."" Opinion among parents is mixed. Children are growing up so fast these days that it’s important they’re taught it before they find out about it from their friends, or the Internet, social media. I personally believe it is down to the parents to teach the children in an environment where you can tell them how much information you want to. I don’t think it’s necessary at primary school age to teach them the ins and outs and all the details, but an important grounding in relationship education is important. The Government says it will consider the report’s findings carefully. jon Brain, BBC News. A man has been arrested in Staffordshire. The 29-year-old was detained by officers from the West Midlands Counter-Terrorism Unit at his home address this morning. Officials in Italy say conditions are getting ‘desperate’ at the reception centre on the island of Lampedusa, where hundreds of migrants have been arriving. Most of them have been rescued from boats in the Mediterranean. There are now more than a thousand men, women and children at the centre - that’s more than double its capacity. Yet more migrants were brought in during the night. Our correspondent, Tom Burridge, is there. This morning we watched chaotic scenes at this tiny Italian island’s reception centre. It is overflowing. We weren’t allowed in and the scores of migrants can’t leave. Most of the men we spoke to through the fence are in their early 20s or teens. This man, who wants to live in Switzerland, said conditions here are not good. It is too much. Very bad. Most people have plenty. Others said they were pleased to be here. They said they now wanted to live in places like Germany or Norway, where they believe they will have a better life. For now, though, they are in limbo in Lampedusa. This facility has room for 300 people. But there are now four times that number of migrants here, including 200 children. It’s an unprecedented situation at this time of year. Boat after boat arrived yesterday and even last night. Among them, children without parents as young as nine. The situation in the reception centre is critical at the moment. There are currently 1,200 guests inside and amongst them there are some 200 children and a bit more than 100 women inside. All of the people we spoke to here got in their flimsy boats in Libya where there is chaos and civil war. It might not seem it, but most who made it to this southern tip of Europe feel lucky. Many more who made the journey before them died. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in Lampedusa. A train carrying crude oil has derailed in a snowstorm and burst into flames in the American state of West Virginia. Hundreds of people living nearby have been ordered to leave their homes as a precaution. The accident- about 30 miles south-east of the state capital, Charleston - caused huge explosions and fireballs. Laura Westbrook reports. A massive fireball fills the sky. It looks like a war zone, but this is Fayette County in West Virginia. The result of a train carrying more than 100 tankers of crude oil that derailed. Several cars burst into flames and one witness said the train ploughed into the home of a local pastor. The locomotive came off the track and went through a house in the neighbourhood of the derailment. The local pastor, we got word here this evening that he did make it out alive. The explosions continued for hours, leaking crude into the Kanawha River. I saw the train explode, a car explode. It shot up a mushroom cloud about as high as the plume is now, like that. More than 200 people have been evacuated, sheltered nearby, but heavy snowfall has hampered efforts to contain the fires. The West Virginia Governor took to Twitter to issue a state of emergency for Fayette and Kanawha counties. The amount of crude oil on American rails hasjumped dramatically, more than 1+,000% in the past five years. The reason for this? Fracking. The construction of pipelines has not been able to keep up with production, so oil companies are resorting to railway lines. Many towns and cities grew up around railroad tracks and there has been a growing concern of the transport of such a lot of dangerous cargo so close to where people live. To avoid scenes like this, the government has promised to build more pipelines, but environmentalists claim there is simply no safe way to transport this lethal substance. Laura Westbrook, BBC News. Firefighters in America have rescued a dog which got stuck in a hole in a cliff. Smoky the dog got into trouble after chasing a squirrel. He had to be coaxed out of the crevice before being lowered to the ground. Traffic on the road below was stopped while the rescue took place. A very happy Smoky was reunited with his owner at the bottom of the cliff. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today: Inflation is now at its lowest ever level. Lower prices at the pumps - and a supermarket price war- have taken it down to 0.3%. In a moment, Nina Ridge will be here with a full national weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first, with news of Scotland’s opening match in the Cricket World Cup, and all the rest of the day’s sport, here’sjessica Chrichton at the BBC Sports Centre. Scotland cricket captain Preston Mommson says he is proud of his team, despite their World Cup defeat to New Zealand. After making a terrible start, Scotland pushed the co-hosts to within 3 wickets of an upset in Dunedin. Tim Hague has more. Make a note, when Scotland play in this World Cup, get to your seat on time. Although those fans may not have regretted their lion, they had already lost two wickets for one run by then, which became four for 12 runs. Three of them golden ducks, he was not one. The lowest score in the World Cup looked likely at that stage, but a couple of half centuries guided Scotland to respectability, yet no1 centuries guided Scotland to respectability, yet no 1 supported them. 109th forward become 192 all out. You would think the hosts New Zealand, one of the tournament favourites, it would be easy for them, but it was not. Having lost three early wickets, 38 runs by Williamson nudged them towards their target, but they then lost another four wickets. They were almost caught out. With a mammoth 25 overs remaining, an unconvincing performance ended with an unconvincing shot, and Scotland must surely think in hindsight, if only we had arrived on time. And whilst Scotland were playing, England were receiving a special welcome after landing in World Cup host nation New Zealand. The team received a traditional Maori welcome in Wellington, ahead of their game against the hosts on Friday. England were outplayed in their opening loss against Australia in Melbourne, so will be hoping for a better performance in 3 days’ time. Scotland have had another setback in their 6 Nations campaign with lock Richie Gray ruled out for the rest of the tournament. Gray injured his arm during their defeat to Wales at the weekend and will be out for 3 months. It comes a day after prop john Welsh was ruled out of the remaining games against Italy, England and Ireland. Wayne Rooney was central to Manchester United’s win over Preston in the FA Cup last night. The United captain was the talk of the tie after an alleged offside and accusations of diving. Before that, though, it was the League One side who took the lead through Scott Laird at the start of the second half. Ander Herrera squeezed home United’s equaliser but Rooney’s positioning at the far post was appealed for offside by the Preston players. And it was Rooney again in the spotlight at the end of the match - was this a dive to claim a penalty and United’s 3rd goal of the night? Well England manager Roy Hodgson has defended his captain. In the run of play, without the replays we have seen so many times, I don’t think any of us would have said that was a penalty. The goalkeeper has commode very rationally, he has gone with both feet. I think he was just taking evasive action. Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has been ordered to PHY H Lance Armstrong has been ordered to pay a record $10 million, just over £6.5 million, in damages to a promotions company. They paid him money in 2006 relating to his seven toured France victories, which have since been scratched from the record books due to his drug-taking. And the company that owns Championship side Birmingham city has been placed into voluntary receivership. The club announced to the Hong Kong stock exchange that it would still fulfil its football league obligations. This is an attempt to resolve the long, internal problems with management. They assure supporters that the club is not in liquidation. That is all for now, back to you, Simon. Researchers in America have developed the most powerful x-ray laser in the world. It’s a billion times more intense that the previous generation of lasers, and is being used to analyse the movement of atoms. Our science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, reports from California. Stretching across the hills of Palo Alto is the world’s most powerful microscope. At its heart is an underground x-ray laser which produces a light that’s so bright it can take pictures of atoms in motion. It is enabling researchers to see living things as they have never been seen before. Here, they are shining the x-rays on molecules linked to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease called amyloids. It is like a protein going wrong. It is a protein that your body naturally makes but then it assembles in a way that is just incorrect. So it’s really important if we are ever going to make drugs to treat this disease, we need to figure out what the structure is. Up until now, nobody has figured out what the structure of an amyloid is. This is the world’s most powerful x-ray laser. It’s a billion times brighter than anything that came before. Each pulse of light inside here has as much power as the entire National Grid. 100 of these pulses hurtle along here every second. The x-rays defract off at many different angles... The head of the facility says the laser has already led to several important discoveries. It’s a revolution. It transforms our ability to look at matter in a new way. We can look at atoms and molecules on the timescales and with the resolution in which they operate in real life, whether it be biology, chemistry or advanced materials. The laser has been so successful that the japanese government has built a similar system and scientists in the UK will be involved in a European x-ray laser, which will be in Hamburg. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nina Ridge. Clear skies last night gave this a frosty start, but a beautiful sunrise from Cleethorpes beach. The Cerner is still shining at the moment. Bright skies across a good part of England and Wales. More cloud further north, coming from the Irish Sea and affecting Scotland and Northern Ireland. The breeze is stronger here, strong winds across northern Scotland. Picking up the moisture and producing some mainly patchy rain. To the east of the Grampians, much drierand brighter. Thicker clouds developing through the afternoon across northern England, with the possibility of rain affecting parts of Columbia -- Cumbria. We will keep a lot of the sunshine along the south coast, through the Midlands and East Anglia, and after the chilly start to the day, temperatures recovering. It should not feel too bad in light winds. We will keep clear skies to the south-east this evening and overnight. A lot more cloud further north, rain developing towards parts of north-west Scotland, and for Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern and western England through Wales, not as cold. As we move further south and east across England, a greater risk of a frosty start tomorrow. Temperatures sitting below freezing in the countryside. Although it is a cold start tomorrow, it should generally be a dry and bright day with sunny spells. Lots more cloud to the North, West in areas picking up cloud. We will see further outbreaks of rain towards north-west Scotland. That will become heavier and more persistent through the day. A mild day, ten to 11 degrees. High pressure will eventually move eastwards. Through the night, it looks as though the weather front will become more active and push further south. Through the day on Thursday, a band of rain moving south eastwards across England and Wales. Behind that, colderairfor Scotland and Northern Ireland with a mixture of bright spells, showers at times, some of them wintry. Temperatures back at seven to 8 degrees with cloud and rain it will feel on the cool side at 809 degrees. Lots of uncertainty at the end of the week as to how quickly the cold front will clear. Then the next system is developing in the Atlantic. Potentially a spell of wet and windy weather, but just one that we will need to keep an eye on through the next couple of days. You can keep up to date with the bmmu can keep up to date with the forecast on the BBC weather website. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: Inflation is now at its lowest ever level. Lower prices at the pumps - and a supermarket price war- have taken it down to 0.3%. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Sonja jessup. One year on from a huge sinkhole opening up under a house in Hemel Hempstead, work is still going on to make the area safe and there are growing calls for compensation for dozens of residents nearby who have been affected. The owner of the house under which the sinkhole appeared hasn’t been able to return home yet and he’s recently been told the damage is so bad his home will have to be demolished. The housing association involved says most residents have now moved back to Oatridge Gardens and it hopes the work to strengthen the ground will finish soon. Yvonne Hall reports. ~ I feel really sad. Everything I Ifeel really sad. Everything I have got is in there. Painful memories for this man. This building site was home to him and his two children, until he woke one morning to find his house hanging precariously over a massive sinkhole. Mentally, we cannot do it. They have rebuilt it and they say it is safe, but who says they can do it again? His/her will be demolished and rebuilt. He does not want to live here again and is asking the housing association to buy back his share. Workers still going on to make the ground safe, filling any remaining cavities with grout. Dozens of residents had to temporarily leave their homes. Many are calling for compensation. The housing association says it has covered all the costs and their welfare is its priority, but many here feel they should receive more to make up for a year of stress and uncertainty. Specialist youth workers will beplaced in major trauma units across the capital to help tackle gang violence. It follows the success of a pilot project at Kings College Hospital. Targeted at young people who are admitted with injuries, it tries to help them leave gang life behind them. We are not going to get a solution just by enforcement, it is important to have the police enforce, enforce the law, crackdown on gangs. And we’re seeing a third less stabbings, half the number of shootings over the last three years. If we’re going to win this battle against some of the street gangs that are particularly violent, not all of them there, then we need these kind of projects. Detectives investigating an attack on a 93-year-old in Soho - who was mugged for £5 - have made an arrest. Stanley Evans was pushed to the floor as he returned home last month. A 29-year-old man was arrested at an address in Camberwell last night on suspicion of robbery. Campaigners in Watford are calling for a change in the law to help protect allotments from development. The Farm Terrace Allotment Holders have already fought off two attempts by Watford Council to turn a local site into housing, but now they face another challenge. The council says the area is desperately short of housing - and it needs the land to build on. Campaigners say current laws need to be strengthened to offer more protection. We’re gutted because you don’t mind fighting and losing, but when you fight and win, but then that isn’t the end of it, it is quite soul-destroying, really. This evening Chelsea are away to Paris St-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. jose Mourinho has confirmed that striker Diego Costa will start the match having served a three-match ban. Costa has scored 17 goals in 19 Premier League games this season. It has been beautiful so far today. Blue skies and sunshine continuing. Feeling rather pleasant, central London is up to around nine Celsius. Once it gets darker little later, it will get quite chilly fairly quickly. We are likely to seek an early frosts as the temperatures fall away. Through the middle part of the night, a little bit more cloud. This could help to protect some areas towards the north-west, for example. We are more likely to see a widespread frost towards Surrey and Kent. The minimum temperature there is around -1. Places in central London are just staying above. A nice, bright start for most of tomorrow. Still a little more cloud developing compared to this afternoon. However, we will still see sunny spells.

102,BBC News 24,17-feb-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"Inflation falls to a new low driven by cheaper petrol and cheaper food. Prices went up last month by just 0.3%, that’s the lowest rate since records began 27 years ago. It sounds like good news for consumers, but we’ll be asking what does it also mean for the economy? Also tonight: violence continues in eastern Ukraine, with neither side apparently observing the ceasefire. The tipper truck tragedy in Bath in which four people died, two men are arrested. Make sex education in England compulsory from primary school age, say MPs; parents give it a cautious welcome. They are still babies stop Bluebirds and the bees, fine, as long as they do not go into too much detail. It is they are going to learn that anyway, in the future. On BBC London: A jewellery shop owner chases after thieves during a smash and grab raid in Twickenham. And how victims of gang violence will be supported in the capital’s major trauma centres. every week. -- A&E. Inspection finds that some patients teeth were damaged at Aberdeen dental school. Good evening. Inflation fell last month to its lowest level since records began, driven by cheaper fuel and food prices. The Consumer Prices Index went down injanuary to 0.3%, that’s its lowest rate since estimates started in 1988. As well as petrol and food, a fall in the cost of other household goods such as games, toys and hobbies has contributed to the record low. Last week, the Bank of England said that inflation may even temporarily turn negative in the spring. Our Economics Correspondent, Andy Verity, reports from Northampton. To find out what falling prices may mean, here is a snapshot of one sector of the economy that has been dealing with it for years... When Steve went into business two decades ago, new may make £100 of profit, selling a top of the range camera, and now, after years of sharp price falls, he will be lucky to make £15. Margins squeezed and squeezed, a lot of cameras, you are making only 5%. If I went into a camera shop business, I would advise people against it! Ido not think you can make a living out of it anymore. Persistently falling prices have meant neither Steve nor his staff have had a pay rise since the recession began commonly cannot afford it. The big industry which has hit a record low, petrol and diesel, down 30.8% compared to 1 euro go. The price of food... And there was a drop in the price of cameras and other photographic equipment. -- compared to one year âqUipITIâI’It. "" COITIp8Iââd to OFIE yâ8Iâ 890. equipment. -- compared to one year ago. This would have cost £1100 four years ago, but then it dropped to less than 700 when the new model came out, buy waiting you could save EAoo. We are used to that happening with cameras, will we get used to it across the entire economy? Good deflation is when falling inflation is driven by things like falling energy prices and food prices, one-off factors that put money back into household pocket, meaning they have more discretionary income. Bad deflation happens when it becomes ingrained, people expect prices to keep falling, then they put of spending because they think the price will fall further. We get into a recessionary situation. Are consumers doing that? Are you putting off buying things because you think they will get cheaper? Not at all, I am very impulsive! If I want it, I go and get it, might not be here next week! Ido that quite often, I will keep looking until I find it at the absolute cheapest. Yes, in the hope that something may go on sale, yes. If I wanted, I buy it, do not care about the cost. Inflation is expected to go below zero in the spring, the price of oil has risen, if inflation turns negative in the coming months, do not expect it to stay that way too long. Two days after a ceasefire was meant to begin in eastern Ukraine, it seems neither government forces nor Russian-backed rebels are honouring the truce. There have been reports of fierce fighting inside the key town of Debaltseve. Rebels say they have taken most of the town, but the government says it is still holding its positions. Clashes have also been reported in Mariupol, a key town to the South. Our International correspondent Ian Pannell is in Donetsk. EXPLOSIONS This is what passes for a cease-fire in Ukraine... A gas pipeline hit by mortarfire, in Ukraine... A gas pipeline hit by mortar fire, filmed by Reuters news crew, who were forced to flee. They promised to lay down their guns, and withdraw heavy weapons. Not here, in Debaltseve. SHOUTING Rebel fighters had been advancing on thousands of government troops. GUNFIRE What you are watching could unpick the entire peace deal in the Ukraine. -- the entire peace deal in the Ukraine. -- in Ukraine. This battle pitches a Western leaning government against a rebellion which looks east to Russia, the Cold War may be over, some of the facilities go on. The war has brought devastation to Ukraine’s economic heartland, more than 5000 people have been killed, 1.5 million people have been uprooted. Yet again, this cease-fire continues to be breached. Peace is holding in many parts across the front line, but as you can see here, the artillery is still firing, in Debaltseve and on the outskirts of Donetsk, and the lives of people caught on both sides is not improved one bit. Many of them cannot leave their shelters, because they simply do not have homes to go to. Others dare not... And we can hear why that is... Scenes like this, in 21st-century Europe. Dank cellar, neighbours from aboveground now squatting in the filth blow it. We have come back to visit a group of pensioners we met last week. To see whether the cease-fire has persuaded them to head up the stairs and home. TRANSLATION: What is at home? It is cold, there is no light, no water, there is nothing, and everything is smashed. We will stay here, we will live here, we cannot move anywhere. Homes abandoned, lives destroyed, and as each day passes, the prospect of peace only fades. STUDIO: We can jointly STUDIO: We canjointly and live, this seems like a cease-fire in name only. -- this seems like a cease-fire in name only. -- we canjoin Ian live. Pretty depressing across parts of eastern Ukraine tonight, on the whole it is fair to say that the cease-fire is holding, most of the areas that were front lines have gone quiet. Donetsk, the capital of the Donetsk people to, largely quiet, but there is key flash points and it is important to remember that this is not the first time they have tried to strike a peace deal. -- this is not the first time they have tried to strike a peace deal. -- the capital of the Donetsk people’s republic. Can the international community, and those world leaders who can bring pressure to bear forced the warring parties to pull back? -- forced the warring parties to pull back? -- can those world leaders. INAUDIBLE But heavy arms have not been pulled back, as was agreed, in key locations, unless that happens, the rest of the peace deal looks like it is in real danger. Thank you very much. Two men have been arrested in connection with a tipper truck which careered out of control in Bath, killing four people. The 32-tonne truck was full of sand and gravel when it hit two pedestrians, including a four year old girl, before colliding with other vehicles on a steep hill. Hywel Griffiths reports. Every day, to four lives lost in a few chaotic seconds today, the fire crew who fought to help the crash victims, returned and paused to remember. All A ll -year-old, the first killed by the careering truck, as she crossed the road with her grandmother, who remained critically ill. Robert Parker, PhilAllen grandmother, who remained critically ill. Robert Parker, Phil Allen and Stephen Vaughan, all from South Wales, died as the 30 tonne truck rolled onto their car. The police investigation began with the lorry and it spilled load of sand and stone, tests were carried out for mechanical faults, witnesses spoke of hearing loud warning blasts from the Horn of the truck. Today, the focus went to its driver, and understood to be 19-year-old Philip Potter, now being questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and manslaughter by gross negligence. A second man who has not been named has also been arrested. Here in Bath, the latest stage of the investigation is being followed very closely but thoughts have already turned to making this community safer, with thousands of pounds being raised to spend on road safety. The family of Mitzi Steady say that they would like the money to be spent around the crash site, they struggle to understand their loss and they are waiting to see where the police investigation leads. Greece is facing increased pressure from its eurozone partners to reach a deal on its debt bailout. If this doesn’t happen Greece could run out of money and be forced out of the Euro. Following the collapse of talks in Brussels, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told the Greek parliament that they wouldn’t accept ""psychological blackmail"". Greece has until Friday to agree to terms set by Eurozone finance ministers. Church of England bishops have issued a pre-election letter, calling for a ""fresh moral vision"" from politicians, and warning that people feel ""detached"" from politics. The letter doesn’t endorse a political party but encourages debate on issues such as nuclear defence and the economy. And it urges congregations to vote in May’s elections. Here’s our Religious Affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt. We had a woman Prime Minister... That bear of prime ministers question Time. He mentions Lady Thatcher, unlike him, he was -- question Time. He mentions Lady Thatcher, unlike him, he was -- she was a Tory leader who won a general election. A moribund political culture, according to bishops. The call not to bother to vote from Russell Brand, it has had a deeper resonance that I ever respected, we do not expect to be as sexy as Russell Brand as bishops(!) but we can say, do engage, do vote, and do use that hard-won democratic freedom that you possess. The bishops 50 page letter, risks entrenching the apathy and cynicism people feel about politics today. They say that it has been widely observed that the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders. -- not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders. -- the 50 page letter says that the election campaign risks entrenching the apathy and cynicism. The letter came as the Conservatives said that they would ensure that youngsters who are out of work do community service, in exchange for benefits. Some Tory MPs criticise the bishops, David Cameron pointed towards the government record on creating and jobs. On bishops and politics I’m always keen for anybody to intervene in politics, it is good that we want to have a political debate in the country. Let’s look at what we are doing to help people who are in work in the country. This is an unprecedented intervention by the house of Bishops, just ahead of a general election campaign. The last time the Church of England did anything similar, 1985, with its report, faith in the cities, seen as deeply critical of Margaret Thatcher’s government. Long-term impact of the letter remains to be sane, criticalas impact of the letter remains to be sane, critical as it is of all politicians of all political parties. I am very positive that they are participating but there is such a thing as the parallel in the new Testament, -- such a thing as the parallel in the new Testament, -- parable, they are accusing politicians of having a mote in their eye, the politicians certainly have the bee. You need to write out 1000 times, you will-- uni to write out 1000 times, ""I will behave myself at prime ministers questions"". -- behave myself at prime ministers questions"". -- you need to write out. Top stories: Inflation falls to a new low, driven by cheaper petrol and cheaper food. Later on BBC London: A court hears that a professional gambler was killed for his winnings after being lured into a honey trap. And why East London’s economy is growing at more than double the national average according to a major bank. hosting the Rangers EGM, now Ibrox will be the venue. And recreating one of the great double acts, Francie and josie return to the stage. It’s ten years since it was made a criminal offence in England and Wales to hunt down and kill a fox with pack of hounds. The Hunting Act was approved after 700 hours of Parliamentary debate and the ban provoked violent scenes between hunting enthusiasts and opponents who said the pastime was cruel. But hunting still happens, so what’s changed? Claire Marshall is at the Beaufort Hunt kennels in Badminton. In the Oxfordshire mist they arrived to hunt. They have roamed this county for over 150 years. Members feel they are part of the soul of the English countryside, which is still being strangled, a decade on, by a bad law. Now landownersjust cull foxes in different ways. You just shoot it. The hunting ban, for the thought they the good they were doing. They haven’t saved lives. They have made it worse. They are shot now? Shot indiscriminately. The question whether to allow a hunt like this to openingly chase and kill foxes can in part be justified by the fact it’s an old tradition. But that tradition has no place, say the campaigners, this is the latest advert from the League Against Cruel Sports which believes the ban is often ignored. Those who flout the law, we think it has been successful. More needs to be done to strengthen the Act. People out there are trying to undermine the spirit of the legislation. The Hunting Act was passed despite huge and violent protests in London. It out lawed the use of dogs to hunt. 340 people have been convicted, mostly for poaching. Around 20 were involved with registered hunts. Now, it’s a battle of the camera phones. Both sides want to gather all the evidence they can to prove innocence or guilt. This is the crime, say protesters, that they’re trying to stop. She scoops up the fox and rushes away from the pack. However, some hunts face saboteurs like this. Last month an onlooker filmed a hunt master being battered with what was described as an iron bar on a rope. So a decade on, does the law satisfy anyone? The hunts want to be free to set their hounds on foxes. Campaigners say the law has helped, but to stamp out traditional fox-hunting for good, law Breakers need to be threatened with prison. Claire Marshall, BBC News. A man accused of being involved in Al-Qaeda plots to bomb targets in England and the United States has gone on trial in New York. Abid Naseer, who’s from Pakistan, is charged with planning attacks in Manchester and New York in 2009. Six MI5 agents are being allowed to give evidence wearing wigs and light make-up in order to protect their identity. Abid Naseer, who denies the charges, will represent himself in court. What has been said in court? The prosecution has made its opening statement and saying that shopping centres in Manchester were the target of the attack. The date for the attack was said to be Easter 2009, in order to maximise deaths and casualties. The prosecution said that Abid Naseer was a harden Al-Qaeda terrorist who trained in terror camps and had been sent to Manchester to carry out this attack. They said he created an email account in a female name in an attempt to avoid detection. Then interacted with an Al-Qaeda handler in Pakistan using code words like ""wedding"" which meant attack. And Nadia, which meant the kind of bomb that has been used. Abid Naseer decided to defend himself in court. He made his own opening statement. He said he created that email account to meet women online and also to play pranks on his friends. Thank you, Nick. The trial of a man accused of murdering 29 people in the Omagh bombing, nearly 17 years ago, will go ahead. Seamus Daly is charged with the Real IRA car bombing attack. Northern Ireland’s Director of Public Prosecutions made the decision after considering the evidence. All state primary and secondary schools in England should teach sex education, according to a new report. Currently, teaching is compulsory only in council- maintained secondaries. MPs on the Commons Education Committee say young people have a ""right to information that will keep them safe."" Sian Lloyd reports. On phones and tablets, via music videos and social media, young people are talking about sex and relationships. Should the debate be focussed more on the classroom and from a younger age Today, we are thinking about why do animals and plants reproduced? A science lesson for nine and ten-year-olds at this primary school in Derbyshire, but the teacher is also introducing questions about human relationships into the discussion. The lesson is designed to build on some of the learning the pupils began last year, about sex and healthy relationships in an age appropriate way. Types of abuse and stuff like that. Why do you think it might be important to learn about that? So you can know how to protect yourself from it. Life skills that a committee of MPs want all state primary and secondary schools in England to deliver, making sex and relationship education for younger children like these compulsory for the first time. Well, we learnt about what changes we will get. She said that boys get it later, girls get it sooner. You will learn more about it when you get to secondary school. You want to know a bit about it before you get there, so you know what to expect. Teaching about sex and relationships is part of the timetable at this school, but that’s not the case everywhere. The report finds that the subject is often sidelined, but it also recognises that there’s a need for schools to consult with parents about the lessons they do provide. I think it should be taught at school. You know, in a controlled environment. Where all the kids are together. I don’t think they should have that stuff going on around them in their heads, at that age. It’s a bit too young. When and how to provide young people with the tools to keep themselves safe remains under debate. This report finds that improvements to current teaching still need to be made. Sian Lloyd, BBC News, Derbyshire. Denmark’s intelligence agency says it was warned by prison officials about the man behind last weekend’s terror attack in Copenhagen. It says it received a report last September saying the 22-year-old was at risk of being radicalised while serving time. But intelligence officers said there was no indication he was planning an attack. Lucy Manning has been talking to the family of one of the men killed. When I look at all of this, the flags and so on, it was very typical of him - he had a lot of friends. He had many Arabic friends, he had many Muslim friends. There was just a lot of them, basically. Dan Uzan protected the people inside the synagogue. Now, outside, they remember him. For his cousin Flemming, this response is the only glimmer of hope. I find it very difficult to comprehend what took place. I find it very difficult to comprehend why. And then we came here, and Dan’s parents realised the enormous compassion. Denmark’s Chief Rabbi, here on the left, showing the grief that has overwhelmed a family and a community. He was my cousin, but he was also my little brother, and he was an uncle to my kids. He was a very, very loving and a very caring person. The first to be killed that day, documentary maker Finn Norgaard, was a believer in free speech, killed as he listened to a debate about it. It is such a loss for us. Finn was the last person you would ever expect to get killed in a situation like this. He was such an open-minded, tolerant person. The Danish intelligence agency has today admitted it was alerted by prison officials about the suspected gunman, Omar El-Hussein, here in the black shorts. But they said there were no indications he was planning an attack. Omar El-Hussein was held at this prison for stabbing a man. He was released from jail only two weeks ago. Now there are calls to see if the police and intelligence service missed the signs of his prison radicalisation. The security service will have to look at how they handled the referral from the prison and probation service. Denmark now asking if it has done enough to stop extremists. Lucy Manning, BBC News, Copenhagen. It was where Britain’s first Grand Prix was held, Brooklands in Surrey. The BBC has learned that it’s to get a multimillion pound facelift to help restore it to its former glory. And to bring part of the famous track back to life. Duncan Kennedy is there. The Heritage Lottery Fund is to pump millions of pounds back into this place to try to restore it to its former glory. ARCHIVE: As the big cars get away, the real battle is on. When it comes to the history of motor racing, few centres of speed can lap Brooklands. Speed, speed and yet more speed. So much speed, cars needed high-sided tracks at the world’s first purpose-built race circuit. john Cobb in his record-breaking Napier-Railton. Legends like Cobb hit 150 miles an hour, at a time when road cars did 20. Cobb’s car still glides round Brooklands and it’s still revealing its secrets. There wasn’t even any front brakes. They asked, why not? And, some comic explained it was designed not to stop, but to go. So no front brakes. Brooklands was also about bikes and aircraft. But with World War II, the whole site was commandeered to build Wellingtons on top of the track. Now though, with £7 million of Heritage Lottery, and other money, the hangar will be moved to reveal the circuit once again. It’s a massive Heritage project. We want to bring motor racing back to life here. Show people what motor racing was like here, and to look after our artefacts as well. This four-and-a-half litre Bentley did speeds of more than 100 miles an hour. It was dangerous and it was intoxicating, and now the team behind this project are hoping this new Lottery money will help to bring back a taste of that golden era. An era that brought Britain’s first Grand Prix in 1926, and with it veterans who welcome the new investment. It’s nice to be able to go back to those old days and see those old cars. Probably with some old drivers as well, driving in what were similar circumstances to the great days of Brooklands. The restoration will take 18 months, bringing back history to the very dawn of flight and checkered flags. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News at Brooklands. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nick Miller Full speed to spring, that is what it seemed like today if you had the sunshine. This was Whitby. I hope it looks this good when I visit in june. Thank you to Michiko Smith for this photograph. Many scenes like this across the UK. You can see on the satellite picture who had the best sunshine. There was a weather system which is feeding in cloud to Northern Ireland and western Scotland, in particular, some rain with that. Most persistent in western Scotland. More cloud generally over night. England and Wales will get clear spells. Where they last long enough you could see a touch of frost. Tomorrow, will turn out to be milder than today. Breezy to windy. Gusty winds across the northern half of the UK, into eastern Scotland and north-east England. Cloud feeding in towards the north-west, leaving southern and eastern parts again with the best of the sunshine. Here is the picture into the afternoon. Some patchy cloud around. Good sunny spells. Temperatures a degree or so higher across southern England and into East Anglia. Patchy rain to western counties of Wales, north-west England and Northern Ireland. Not raining all the time. There will be outbreaks of rain in western Scotland. More persistent into the afternoon into the north-west highlands. This is Thursday. Notice the rain has moved south. Pushing through England and Wales. Maybe not into the far south-east until after dark. Sunnier skies, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scattered showers, feeling cooler. Is more wet and windy weather coming in on Sunday. Really changeable at the moment. More detail where you are online. Rita. Thank you. A reminder of our main story. Inflation has fallen to a new low, driven by cheaper petrol and cheaper food. That’s all from the BBC News at Six. It’s goodbye from me.

A year after a huge sinkhole opened up under a house, the growing calls for compensation for residents. And we’ll be on the orange carpet talking to Dame judi Dench and Celia Imrie about being reunited for the sequel of the Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Welcome to the programme with me, Riz Lateef. Dramatic CCTV pictures show the moment a shop owner chased two thieves armed with axes out of his jewellery store during a smash and grab raid. The 41-year-old fought back with a baseball bat after the robbers burst into the family-run business in Twickenham. They took tens of thousands of pounds’ worth of watches and jewellery. Victoria Hollins reports. This is the moment thieves in broad daylight smashed their way into a family-run jewellery business. There was an almighty bang, basically, which made mejump out of my skin and I am confronted with a man in a crash helmet with an axe. It tookjust one minute for them to grab around £20,000 of valuables. Mark Guess watched as they attacked the business he has run for 25 years. And that is the main thing that he grabbed. That is what he cleared out, which is again why there is nothing in there now. But what Mark did next surprised himself as well as the thieves. He ran after them with a baseball bat. The second he turned his back to get on the mopeds and go, like I say, I was on him, quick. Was that a calculated move? No. Like I say, it was a stupid response. It wasjust adrenaline. I was just pumped up and just angry. I just thought, you are not taking my stuff. Mark thinks they were targeting high-value luxury watches and while they stole up to 40 items, the majority weren’t the most valuable. It was just so brazen. The newly ran over. There were people in the cafe next order, and theyjust expected to get away with that. Police have seen the CCTV footage from all of the three cameras. Mark still hasn’t decided if he was heroic or crazy. Coming up later in the programme: From football to film - the unusual career change for a former Chelsea player. Youth workers will be placed in all of the capital’s major trauma centres to help victims of gang violence.

This is how the emergency department at Kings College Hospital swings into action. It is a rehearsal here, but last year alone, they treated more than 500 seriously injured young Londoners. Some had been shot, some stabbed. So we’ve got the chest drain, ultrasound, brilliant... Very lucky to be alive. Amar was stabbed last summer by someone he knew.

I live outside London, away from, notjust south, but London itself. Specialist youth workers here at Kings College Hospital have been supporting young people who have been attacked, stabbed, or even shot over the past decade.

We need to understand that there are high harm violent hotspots and we need to understand what is driving that. But if we are going to win this battle against some of the street gangs that are particularly violent -not All of them are, then we need these projects, that help people out of the life of violence. Back in 2001, I went down for a long period of time. Now, after serving his sentence, junior Smart runs the biggest anti-gangs project in the capital, but he fears the problem of Gang capital, but he fears the problem of gang violence is much bigger than people realise. Young people typically won’t say that they have been involved in gangs. They will see it as a group of friends. Young people will not say that they have been stabbed. They will make up excuses, so really what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. It is hoped this expanded project can help more people who are the victims we know about. Nick’s here now. It’s clearly seen as a success to be rolled out across the capital, but li’IâIââ BFE SOITIE BFEBS of COFICEITI? Yes, they have had the experience of the past decade of what they have been doing there and they have judged it to be a success, and so from April, all of the four major, centres we have will have this particular service available. That means at the Royal London in Whitechapel and other hospitals, they will be setting this up from scratch and they will be recruiting more specialist youth workers. The hopeis more specialist youth workers. The hope is that more young people cant escape a life of violence if they find themselves victims of gang crime. It is interesting because this cash is been allocated by City Hall, but it has actually come from the Ministry ofjustice, and I think a lot of people I spoke to today were mindful that that Government department has seen cuts along with other departments over the past five years and still some people are quite conscious of where funding in the future for project like this will come from. just a word on the wider picture, clearly a lot of people will be encouraged by the fact that use violence has fallen over the past year although we still have those hotspots in the capital, but the murder rate in the first two months of this year has been a concern for young Londoners, and obviously some people say that one person is too many. In terms of what happens next, we have got these projects, and also education is seen as the key thing, because the boy who we saw in that report there, the youth worker, he said it is amazing, he goes to schools in dogs young people and they may say that they think -- young people and they may say that they think -- and talks to young people, and they think that there will not be consequences if they stab someone. Clearly, education is key. A court has heard how a professional poker player was killed for his winnings after being lured into a trap by a young woman he met at a casino in Mayfair. He was bound and beaten to death in his flat last year. Three people including a 25-year-old woman are accused of his murder. Miranda Schunke reports. Waving around wads of £50 notes, this is the only dreamt and her two accomplices. -- this is the only dreamt and her two accomplices. -- Leonie Granger. The 56-year-old was found in March last yearin 56-year-old was found in March last year in his own home, after being kicked and stabbed to death. The court heard how the professional gambler had met Leonie Granger at the Palm Beach Casino in Mayfair some weeks earlier. On the night of his death, they had dinner together, and she was flattered by her attention. The parent left the gazebo just before attention. The parent left the gazebojust before midnight and returned here to his Islington flat. A little more than an hour later, a taxi was booked to take Leonie Granger,, and it is at that point, the prosecution suggest, that she opened the door to let the killers in. In court, the prosecution outlined the motive to the jury, saying that the truth is that Leonie Granger was not interested in anything other than money, and that is how he came to be tied up and kicked to death in his own flat. By keeping his winnings at home instead of in the bank, the prosecution says it made him vulnerable to the unscrupulous. Leonie Granger alongside her confidences deny the charges -- alongside her confidences deny the charges -- accomplices, deny the charges and the case continues. Detectives investigating an attack on a 93-year-old in Soho,who was mugged for £5, have arrested a 29 year old man in Camberwell. Stanley Evans was pushed to the floor as he returned home last month. A Roman Catholic priest sexually abused boys at a West London care home in the 80s,a court has heard. Father Anthony McSweeney is on trial at Southwark Crown Court, accused of abusing boys at Grafton Close Children’s Home in Hounslow.

A legal challenge is being launched at the High Court against plans to build a garden bridge over the River Thames. A Lambeth resident claims his local council unlawfully granted planning permission. The London Garden Bridge Trust says the project will boost tourism. The council says the plans were given ""careful and thorough"" consideration. East London is booming. That’s according to a new survey by the Royal Bank of Scotland which suggests that growth in the east of the city is now running at more than 5% annually - more than double the national average. Technology, media and telecommunication firms have seen some of the biggest growth, but according to many businesses long term prosperity is now in danger due to poor broadband speeds. Alex Bushill reports. Silicon roundabout, Tech city. Something special is happening here economically. Here, the economy is growing at double the rates of other local areas. growing at double the rates of other localareas. Localfirms growing at double the rates of other local areas. Local firms like this hold the key. They have doubled in size in the past year and specialise in medical technology. A lot of our work is based on collaboration and partnerships. We have got lots of collaborators close by and colleagues who work at Cambridge University and so on. Like other start-ups around here, he complains of high business rates and rather ironically, slow broadband speeds. The issue is around the availability of fast broadband that is holding them back. We need to do more to help them get the right coverage and the right service that they need, because otherwise it will impact on the to mind. Infact, a parliamentary report today suggest that London has slumped to the 23rd capital city in Europe in terms of broadband speed. This being Tech city, the Government’s digital champion spoke to me today. We fully understand that broadband is critical to any business. Let’s not forget that this area has gone from under 50 companies do over 3000 companies in the past five years. He stressed that last year we saw record levels of investment in tech start-ups in London. He says that our digital economy will win out over its rivals. Still to come tonight: We are getting in the mood for the most colourful of premiers as we speak to the stars of the film. A year after this huge sinkhole opened up undera house in Hemel Hempstead the owner’s been told the damage is so bad his home will have to be demolished. There are growing calls for compensation for dozens of nearby residents who’ve been affected. The housing association says most people have moved back and it hopes the work to strengthen the ground will finish soon. Yvonne Hall has more. Painful memories. This building site used to be Sharif’s home, along with his two young children, until last February, when he woke up and found a massive sinkhole under his house. It is believed heavy rainfall had forced open an old mining cavity. We could have all died in this building. That is the scary thing. One year on and work is still going on to make the ground safe. Grout is being pumped into the ground to fill any remaining cavities. Sharif’s home has got to be demolished and rebuilt, but he has told the property managers, High Town Housing Association, he never wants to live here again. I can’t move back in here with my family. The only option I think they should do is buy me out of the house and compensate us for our losses and get somewhere that we can be and look after us, basically, because what happened here is not my fault. Many other residents agree. Nearly Ao people had to leave their homes last year. Most have moved back. Some say the housing association should now pay compensation. Mary Bormann’s home overlooks the building site, where work is expected to carry on for at least another year. It has been the most horrendous year of our lives. It has been really scary. We didn’t know how big the hole was, whether it was safe to come back. I never thought I would be able to live in my house again at first, but we have come back now and we are trying to make the best of the situation. We just want to get on with our lives and try to forget this ever happened, but now to be told actually it is going on until the middle of 2016. You know, it is not good. High Town Housing Association says it doesn’t want to be interviewed About the concerns of the residents, but it said there is no evidence to show that the sinkhole and the ongoing works here have had any impact at all in the value of properties. It will not say whether it will pay compensation or not, but says it has already covered all of the costs, including alternative accommodation. This man believes just meeting the costs is not enough. It does not compensate for the trauma he and others have been through. Plans for a major regeneration of Alexandra Palace have been given the go-ahead. Haringey Council has approved plans for a £28 million revamp. It’ll include a new museum dedicated to the BBC Studios and restoring the Victorian theatre. Plans to create a ÂlIoo million stadium for Tottenham Football Club could be scrapped after the owners of a family business claim they are being forced out to make way for the new ground. Lawyers for the family who run Archway Sheet Metal Works say the compulsory purchase order is invalid, but the club say allowing the business to remain on site would halt their plans for a new 56,000 capacity stadium. Tonight Chelsea are in France for the first leg of their knockout Champion’s League match with Paris Saint Germain. Our Sports Reporter Sara Orchard is here. We’ll get to the match in a moment, but first the former Chelsea player now treading the boards. Since retiring, Frank LeBouef has followed in the footsteps of other footballers and started to join the world of acting. In 1998, Frank LeBouef helped France to lift the World Cup in Paris. No greater moment in the career of any footballer, surely. But do Chelsea fans recognise him now? If we try to bring him round from the anaesthetic, it is not certain he will survive the resuscitation. A successful career change and LeBoue is now an actor, recently winning the role as the Swiss doctor in the Oscar-nominated Stephen Hawking film The Theory of Everything. I thought it was something I wanted to do. It is another passion on top of football and we have a chance to have maybe two different lives and I wanted to try that and it worked pretty well. However, football is still very much in his DNA. Filming in North London brought home some special memories. We shot close to Wembley, so we are near the terraces, and we saw Wembley, and I was with Eddie Redmayne, and I asked him what his best souvenir was. And I say over there was pretty good. Terrific cups. One League Cup, a good game against England with France. Still a Chelsea fan, he will not be at the match tonight, I will not be at the match tonight, Hubble used a play. at the match tonight, Hubble used a pw ÂÂ play. -- acting in a comedy play.

It is the first leg of their last 16 Champions League match. Now, juicy Marie Newell has confirmed if you want to hear all of the action from Paris, turned to BBC London radio. They will be broadcasting live from France with full coverage of Paris Saint Germain versusjust see. Some news from Brentford today. Yes, disappointing news for their fans, because it has been confirmed that their manager, who is so popular, is going to be leaving at the end of the season, along with his assistant, who has also confirmed that their sporting director will also be leaving with immediate effect. He has been put on gardening leave. It has been reported last week that the club’s owner had been over to Spain to speak to another possible new manager, so that is why it will not be a surprise. They have a big game this Saturday and this will be a bit of a distraction. Thank you. Next: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are joining acting royalty on a marigold rather than red carpet this evening for the premiere of The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The sequel sees Dame judi Dench’s character Evelyn discovering a head for business she didn’t even know she had. that the other one over their users will and I prefer your quality of silk. I will give you 5000 1+1+. Done. I will see you tomorrow. Thank you for your respect. Well, our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus caught up with Dame judie Dench and Celia Imrie on the Marigold carpet in Leicester Square. ~ Iam I am suitably impressed with your outfits. Where you are expecting all of this tonight? It is lovely. It should always be here. Whatever the film. Exactly. They should leave it up. As well as you being acting royalty, we also have real royalty in attendance. Do you think that is a testament to the success of the film? Yes. I haven’t met anyone who did not love it. That is what is so incredible. Wejust had a great time. It is a remarkable, irreverent and affectionate film, which is rarely seen on film. Do you think there is room for more of this sort of film? I suppose. I don’t think we expected it was going to be a success and I think suddenly it came out on a very cold day and you can’t help but be affected by the heat and the colour and the passion of it all and maybe it is to do with that as much as anything else. It is so clever actually to have it coming out in Frederick, when everyone is freezing, because you can be transported, lately. -- freezing, because you can be transported, lately. -- in the debris. -- transported, lately. -- in the debris. -- in February. Is it quite good to be working with young talent? Always. I only got one scene with the young people, and one quick line. I should think it was frightening, because we all knew each other. Your stage presence is as impressive as your film career. I note you are very passionate about the theatre. Do you think what we have seen in terms of arts cuts and changes that it is going to be covered for a new generation of actors? , welll covered for a new generation of actors? , well I think it is very tough new actors. There are always too many actors and too few parts. I think you are both testament to the fact that talent is never out of work. Congratulations and enjoy the rest of your night. We will. Thank you very much. Time for a check on the weather with Nina Ridge. With the clear skies come falling temperatures, so we are looking at the touch of frost with temperatures below freezing. There was more cloud today, but it looks as though that will be creeping further south. Not a huge amount of change as legal through the night tonight, so with those light winds and the skies, a more widespread frost. In the city centre, hovering above freezing. In the countryside, we are more likely to see frost. Another bright start to the day. Plenty of sunshine. We may see some patchy cloud out to the north-west at times, but not spoiling the day with those light winds. Another fine day in store. Importers will be very similar to today. We will get up to eight Celsius or nine Celsius. Through Wednesday night, there will be some changes happening to the north-west of the UK, there is this weather front which is set to move its way south. It has been producing quite a view solutions as to how quickly it will move southwards. At the moment, the latest forecastjust keeps it slightly to the north. This forecast is more likely at the moment, and so it should stay dry, but become cloudier. The rainjust about stealing to the north-west through daylight hours. Sticking with the dry weather and temperatures at around eight Celsius or nine Celsius. Not a bad day at this stage on Thursday. Then as we look to the next couple of days, more rain to come on Friday. Once that has cleared, it will turn colder with a mixture of sunshine and showers on Saturday. A reminder of the main headlines: Inflation fell last month to its lowest level since records began, driven by cheaper fuel and food prices. The Consumer Prices Index went down injanuary to 0.3%. Two days after a ceasefire was meant to begin in eastern Ukraine, it seems neither government forces nor Russian-backed rebels are honouring the truce. There’ve been reports of fierce fighting inside a key town. Church of England bishops have issued a pre-election letter, calling for a ""fresh moral vision"" from politicians. The letter doesn’t endorse a political party, but encourages debate on issues such as nuclear defence and the economy. CCTV pictures show the moment a jeweller chased two armed thieves out of his store during a smash and grab raid. The 1+1-year-old fought back with a baseball bat after the robbers burst into his Twickenham shop. And youth workers are to be placed in all of the capital’s major trauma centres to help victims of gang violence. The idea, trialled at Kings College Hospital, is to support young patients as they’re released from medical care. That’s it for now. I’ll be back with the latest for you during the ten o’clock news.

It’s down to 0.3% - driven down by cheaper petrol, falling food prices and fierce supermarket competition. We’ll be looking at the implications for the economy and interest rates. Also tonight: Fierce fighting in a key town in Eastern Ukraine - despite the ceasefire agreed last week. The Church of England calls on politicians to deliver a fresh moral vision ahead of the General Election. We are WE BFE COI’1CâI’Iâ1âd GS WE We are concerned as we know others are, with a sort of alienation really from the whole political process. On trial in New York - the 28-year-old who was allegedly part of an al-Qaeda plot to attack Manchester and New York. And a promising start for Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League. On BBC London: A high street smash and grab and the jeweller who chased the armed thieves with a baseball bat. And superfast growth in east London’s economy but is slow internet speed holding companies back? Good evening. Inflation has hit its lowest level since current records began 26 years ago. The Consumer Price Index fell to 0.3% - driven by cheaper fuel and food prices. The Government called the record low a milestone for the economy and good news for consumers. But Labour says it doesn’t make up for sluggish wage growth. The latest figures come after the Bank of England predicted that inflation will turn negative in the next few months - for the first time in five decades. Here’s our economics correspondent Andy Verity. It was in january that falling oil prices accelerated their descent bringing motorist a windfull at the petrol pumps. Today we found out the cost of living rose by less than it has in a generation. 0. 3%. Soon that may drop below zero. Deflation. What might that mean for consumers and businesses? Some business owners can tell you they’ve been coping with falling prices for years. When Steve went into business two decades ago, he might make 100 profit selling a top of the range camera. Now he would be lucky to make 15. Margins are squeezed and squeezed. On a lot of cameras you are making 1 perfect 5%. If I was going into a camera shop business I would advise people not to do it because I don’t think you can make a living at the moment. Persistently falling prices have meant near Steve or his staff have had a pay rise sips the recession began. He can’t afford it. The biggest recession inflation has hit a record low is petrol and diesel, down compared to a year ago. The price of food was down by 2. 8%. And there was a drop of 7. 6% in the price of cameras and other photographic equipment. Three months ago, this model of camera would have cost 1100, then the new model came out and it dropped to less than 700, by waiting, in other words, cow save lIÂ00. -- you could save 400. by waiting, in other words, cow save 4Â00. -- you could save 400. We are used to what happening with cameras. Will we get used to it across the economy? Good deflation is when falling inflation is driven by things like falling energy prices or falling food prices. Factors that put money back into household pockets. Bad deflation happens when it becomes ingrained, people expect prices to keep falling and then they put off spending because they think prices are going to fall further. We see consumer spending drop and we get into a recessionary situation. So are consumers doing that? Do you put off buying things ever because you think they’ll get cheaper in the next few months? No, if I want it, I am impulsive, Iwill go next few months? No, if I want it, I am impulsive, I will go and get it. I won’t wait until next week. Might not be there next week. I do that often actually or I will keep looking untill often actually or I will keep looking until I find it at the absolute cheapest. Yes. In the hope that maybe something might go on sale or something, yeah. If inflation does drop below zero it may not last long. Oil prices have already bounced and petrol prices have picked up. The Bank of England predicts by the end of the year prices generally will be rising again and a modest rise in interest rates may follow. Andy is here with me now. How long will prices keep falling? According to the predictions from the Bank of England the first get negative inflation in the spring sometime or at least you are likely to and that will probably last for a few months. We haven’t really got any sign yet of the bad deflation that some economists fear. We have got a good sort of deflation where prices are coming down in essential goods that you more or less have to buy like food or fuel. you more or less have to buy like food orfuel. Although of you more or less have to buy like food or fuel. Although of course you may buy more of them. Where it would turn bad is where people might put off purchases because they believe prices will come down so they can save money. Interestingly, the example of technology in that film, in the case of cameras people don’t do that, they don’t put off spending on big ticket items because they still want to have the latest thing. So long as people feel fairly well-off they’re un likely to engage in that behaviour and you are un likely to have the bad deflation. Tomorrow we will get the unemployment numbers, likely to belowest again in six years and that will put pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates perhaps modestly by the end of the year. Thank you. There’s been fierce fighting in parts of Eastern Ukraine, despite the ceasefire agreed on Sunday. A battle is raging for control of the town of Debaltseve a transport hub and a key supply route which the Ukrainian forces are determined to hold on to. But thousands of pro-Russian rebels are now said to have reached the centre of the town, amid reports of hand-to-hand combat, heavy shelling and the capture of Ukrainian soldiers. Our international correspondent, Ian Pannell, is monitoring events from Donetsk. This is what passes for a ceasefire in Ukraine. A gas pipeline hit by mortar fire, filmed by Reuters news crew, who were forced to flee. They promised to lay down their guns and withdraw heavy weapons. Not here in Debaltseve. Rebel fighters have been advancing on thousands of government troops. And what you are watching could unpick the entire peace deal in Ukraine. This battle pitches a Western-leaning government against a rebellion that looks east to Russia. The Cold War may be over but some of the hostilities go on. Scenes like this only feed this conflict. Russian TV showed what seemed to be Ukrainian troops in rebel hands. They claimed more than 70 were taken prisoners in Debaltseve. Ukraine said some of its forces had been ambushed. The war has brought devastation to Ukraine’s economic heartland. More than 5,000 people have been killed; a million and a half uprooted. Yet again, this ceasefire continues to be breached. While the peace is holding in many parts across the frontlines, as you can hear, the artillery is still firing here on the edges of Donetsk and also in the strategic town of Debaltseve. And, crucially, life for people caught on both sides of this conflict hasn’t improved one bit. Many of them can’t leave their shelters because they simply don’t have homes to go to. Others dare not. And you can hear why. Scenes like this in 21st Century Europe. A dank cellar where neighbours from above ground now squat in the filth below it. We have come back to visit a group of pensioners we met last week to see whether the ceasefire has persuaded them to head up the stairs and home. TRANSLATION: It is cold, there is no light, no water. There is nothing and everything is smashed. We will stay here, we will live here. We cannot move anywhere. Homes abandoned, lives destroyed, and as each day passes the prospect of peace only fades. That was the situation today. This evening President Vladimir Putin of Russia has been speaking, talking about the situation here in Ukraine. He said that there had been a considerable reduction in the fighting. He also said that he had predicted that there would be continued fighting around the town of Debaltseve. He urged the Ukrainian Government to urge troops to lay down arms and leave and for the rebels to give them safe passage. It remains to be seen whether that is really what happens. In an unprecedented move, the Church of England has called on politicians to come up with a fresh moral vision to tackle what it calls an almost moribund political culture. With three months to go before the General Election, Bishops have urged congregations to engage in the political process, put aside self-interest and vote for the common good. Our religions affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, reports. We had a woman Prime Minister... The bear pit of Prime Ministers Question Time. Unlike him she was a Tory leader who won a general election. The kind of politics the Bishops say is putting voters off. They’ve even offended Britain’s nuns, no wonder people say they haven’t got a prayer. We are concerned, with the alienation really from the whole political process. It’s been shown in low turnouts in recent elections and we think that’s dangerous really for our country and we are concerned about both that alienation, but also the way we might be becoming divided from each other. The Bishops letter criticises both right and left calling instead for a fresh moral vision within politics that unites, rather than divides. On the economy, they say it’s been widely observed that the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders. And on the role of the state, that the ideals of the big society should not be consigned to the political dustbin. The Bishops’ letter came as the Conservatives promised they would ensure youngsters who are out of work for sometime do community service in exchange for benefits. While some Tory MPs criticised the Bishops, MrCameron pointed them towards the Government’s record on creating combroet and jobs -- towards the Government’s record on creating combroet and jobs -- growth and jobs. creating combroet and jobs -- growth andjobs. On and jobs. On Bishops and politics I am keen for anyone to intervene in politics, it’s good we want to have a he debate in our country but let’s look at what we are doing to help people who are in work in our country. This is an unprecedented intervention by the House of Bishops ahead of a general election campaign. The last time the Church of England did anything similar was in 1985 with its report faith in the cities that was seen as deeply critical of Margaret Thatcher’s Government. The long-term impact of this letter remains to be seen, critical as it is of all politicians of all political parties. We cannot see an emerging generation of our young people as a... Lord Heseltine remembers well coming under fire from the Bishops, though today he was in more forgiving mood. Look, they’re human beings. They have experience of many of the more acute social problems, so of course they have a view and an experience. What they don’t always have is solutions and practical politics, that’s the business that politicians are in. Without moral vision we will per ish and if it isn’t the job of the Bishops to give us moral vision I don’t know whose it is. You need to write out 1,000 times I will behave myself at Prime Ministers questions! Greece has insisted it will not extend its bailout programme this week, despite what it called psychological blackmail from European leaders. Members of the eurozone have given Athens until Friday to accept the rescue deal- which would require further austerity measures. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, said the proposal amounted to a surrender. Mark Lowen reports from Athens. It is three weeks since his electoral triumph, now he has three days to avert disaster. Alexis Tsipras, given an ultimatum by the eurozone to follow the bail out or push Greece over the edge. But after the talks in Brussels collapsed, today the Prime Minister was defiant. TRANSLATION: We want a solution, not a clash. Our goal is to avoid a clash. Our goal is a viable solution with tough negotiation and we refuse to succumb to psychological blackmail. The fear is a return to the drachma, a monument to the past, but if Greece rejects a deal, a euro exit could bring it back. The government says it was elected to renegotiate the bail out but eurozone leaders, particularly Germany, insist the current bail out is extended or else. No-one can kick out any member of the eurozone but, unfortunately, someone can be led towards the exit simply because he won’t have the necessary liquidity to be able to pay the public sector on a monthly basis, so there is a series of negative scenarios that could follow if there isn’t an agreement struck by the end of this week. The key to understanding Greece’s position is the national mood here. Greeks feel humiliated by the financial crisis and this deeply proud nation believes it finally has a government ready to stand up to Brussels and Berlin, but if it’s forced to row back considerably, or if euro exit suddenly seems likely, the government’s huge support could fade fast. The standoff has increased the flow of money out of Greek banks to around two billion euros a week. It’s prompted fears capital controls could be imposed to limit withdrawals. The uncertainty is hitting Greece’s biggest industry, tourism. This hotel owner has already had customers put bookings on hold and he’s taking precautions. The day after elections, I went to bank and take out one third of my money, because I think that the new Prime Minister is gambling. A country tired by crisis is in a race against time. Can a compromise be found or will Greece be the place where the single currency breaks? Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. The trial of a man accused of murdering 29 people in the Omagh bombing, nearly 17 years ago, will go ahead. Seamus Daly is charged with the Real IRA car bombing attack. Northern Ireland’s Director of Public Prosecutions made the decision after considering the evidence. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of causing the deaths of four people who were killed when a lorry careered out of control in Bath last week. The 32 tonne tipper truck, full of sand and gravel, hit two pedestrians, one of them a four-year-old girl, before colliding with other vehicles on a steep hill in the city. The chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph, Peter Oborne, has resigned saying the paper’s lack of coverage of HSBC and allegations of tax avoidance ""amounts to a form of fraud on its readers.""' In a long statement, he said commercial interests had also skewed the paper’s coverage of China and Tesco. The paper has rejected the claims. The trial of a Pakistani man, alleged to have taken part in an Al-Qaeda plot to bomb a shopping centre in Manchester and New York’s subway system, has opened in the United States. Abid Naseer, who’s 28, was extradited from the UK in 2013 after he was arrested in Manchester where he’d been living on a student visa. Our New York correspondent, Nick Bryant, was in court. Nick. Sophie, it was a dramatic day, partly because Abid Naseer decided to represent himself in court and to deliver his own opening statement. Partly, because American prosecutors raised the spectre of another September 11th, as they described this alleged Al-Qaeda plot on New York, Copenhagen and Manchester. Abid Naseer, the 28-year-old Pakistani national charged with being part of an Al-Qaeda conspiracy to repeat the devastation of 9/11. He was one of a dozen men arrested in raids across the north-west in 2009. Police feared an attack was just days away, but following searches of their houses, none were ever charged in the UK, through lack of evidence. The Arndale Shopping Centre, in Manchester, was the target of the attack, US prosecutors claim, and the date chosen - the Easter holiday in 2009, to maximise the number of deaths and casualties. The alleged Al-Qaeda cell had also carried out reconnaissance on the nearby St Anne’s Square, an area popular with tourists, but this was part of a broader plot, which included plans to bomb a New York subway. 2009, if this had been successful, it would be up there with your Mumbai attack, with 9/11, with what happened in Madrid. It would have been up there. It was at this internet cafe in Manchester that prosecutors claim Abid Naseer sent emails to an Al-Qaeda handler in Pakistan called Sohai. He created email accounts in women’s names to avoid detection and used code words to concede his plans. ~ -- conceal. The word ""wedding"" or ""Nikkah"" was used are for ""attack."" And women’s names, like ""Nadia"", described which kind of bombs would be used. Defending himself in court, Abid Naseer claimed he’d set up an account in a female’s name to meet women online and to play pranks on his friends. In a move that could have been lifted from the pages of a spy novel, the judge has ruled that MI5 agents who conducted surveillance on Abid Naseer can testify in court, wearing wigs and light make-up, in order to conceal their identities. The jury will also be the first to see evidence seized during the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in 2011, that left the Al-Qaeda leader dead. If convicted, Abid Naseer could face life imprisonment. Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York. The Big Six energy suppliers are facing fresh questions over their market power and the amount they charge some customers. The competition authorities will publish a report tomorrow, which is expected to be highly critical. Our industry correspondent, john Moylan, is here. What are they are expected to accuse the Big Six of doing? This is a major investigation into the industry. It has been going on sincejune. It the industry. It has been going on since june. It followed all of those concerns over prices and profits. A view the market wasn’t working for most consumers. Tomorrow we get an update. I learnt tonight there will be serious concerns raised in the report about the power of the Big Six suppliers. They will point to evidence that they don’t have to really compete for millions of their customers. These are customers who don’t switch. They are inactive. They are vulnerable customers often, they routinely get charged more than others, up to £230 more than others if they had switched. Interestingly, the competition authorities, they won’t say at this stage, they haven’t decided if it’s a deliberate plw by haven’t decided if it’s a deliberate ploy by the Big Six or a historical fact of how we opened up our market. They won’t say whether the proof the the Big Six make are excessive. On the other key issue, will the Big Six be broken up? At this stage it doesn’t look like a smoking you gun. It doesn’t look like the break-up of the Big Six is is on the cards. David Cameron has insisted that he does not regret British efforts to help Libya overthrow Colonel Gaddafi, despite growing unrest there, and the threat from extremists. The Prime Minister maintained his decision to send British military forces to the north African country in 2011 was the ""right thing to do"" and said there was no question of the UK ""abandoning"" Libya. Here’s our diplomatic correspondent, james Robbins. David Cameron has no regrets about this, his decision in 2011 to send RAF jets to attack the forces of Colonel Gaddafi and help bring him down. Two years ago, the Prime Minister walked the streets in Libya, something he couldn’t do now. Saying, ""we will stand with you every step of the way."" But Britain and other key powers have failed to prevent this, Libya 2015, a state which has collapsed and now provides a haven for so-called Islamic State on Europe’s doorstep. There’s no question of Britain abandoning Libya. Britain is giving Libya support through our aid budget. We did a major training project for the Libyan security forces. We’re doing work to try to bring together a national unity government in Libya, but of course what we face in Libya is a very difficult situation. With far too many armed militias, without a proper government. If Britain intervene in Libya again, what would be the aim? Clearly, the extremists of so-called Islamic State would be the target, but there are many reasons why Britain is not going to get involved. There have been major shifts in foreign policy. First, the political earthquake of 2013 when the Commons stopped David Cameron striking President Assad over chemical weapon attacks. The Prime Minister made clear he won’t act in future without MPs’ active support. Second, what we can call the Iraq then Afghan legacy, a war weariness in Britain, exemplified by the Wootton Bassett outpourings of grief to greet each body brought home from another conflict which many Britons questioned. There’s the famous example of America after Vietnam and everyone said America would never go to war again, but of course they did. One never knows how long these things are going to last. I think the tide of opinion at the moment is against intervention in the Middle East, I’m with the tide on that, but things could changes. As Egyptian families mourn again today, for the Christian copt beheaded in Libya by Islamic State, there may be huge sympathy around the world, but Egypt’s President faces an uphill struggle urging any sort of international military response. TRANSLATION: Egypt, the Mediterranean basin and Europe have to deal with this problem because the mission was unaccomplished, unfinished by our European friends. We abandoned the Libyan people as prisoners to the extremists militias. Tomorrow, Egypt takes its case for international force in Libya to the UN Security Council, but Britain is not alone insisting it’s UN-led political mediation, not military intervention, which offers the only possible solution. james Robbins, BBC News. The fracking revolution in America has helped the US economy bounce back from recession and provided a plentiful supply of cheap oil and gas. But now the steep fall in oil prices has proved a significant challenge to the industry’s economic viability. West Texas has been, until now, enjoying an oil boom. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, has been to Midland to see how it’s coping now that boom has turned to bust. It’s the middle of the night, the temperature is below freezing and the oil men here, with so much capital equipment tied up, are working round-the-clock, racing to finish the frack on this site in West Texas. Whether it will be worth bringing the oil out of the ground is another question. The boss told me that to break even, they need to be selling at $80 a barrel, it’s nowjust around $50, and that means tough choices. It’s painful. The layoffs are just starting. The large oil service companies are now announcing thousands of layoffs. But then locally, there are small operators who are laying people off every day. I heard about two more today, people that I know and there’s no hope of near term reemployment. The oil from this well might not be pumped now because of Saudi Arabia maintaining production levels at a time when demand is falling, driving the price downwards. But though the site might be mothballed, the resource is still there to be tapped when the economics change. Three months ago, there were 580 wells operating in this area of West Texas, it’s now down to 450, it could halve again by the summer if oil stays at $50 a barrel. That means big job losses, but not everyone is mourning the fall in the oil price. just look at these pump prices, that’s about 33p a litre. It’s cheaper to fill up, sure, but it also means that US consumers have more to spend on other things and that is driving growth. How much difference does it make to your kind of day-to-day life, the fact that you’ve got extra money to spend? A lot when I’ve got four cars in my household. Oh, yes, tremendously. Yeah? Does it make a big difference? It makes a big difference. You know, you can save and spend money on other things. Other sectors are feeling exactly the same thing. This farmer has 5,500 acres of cotton. At a time when margins are being squeezed, he’s seen a significant overhead come right down. So, Doug, what impact does fuel have on the business? Well, it’s a big impact. It’s another big expense we have. We have nine tractors and we burn nearly 100 gallons for each one of those tractors. We’re saving up to $450 a day, just on fuel alone. But what the low price doesn’t change is that America has become the world’s largest natural gas and oil producer, with dependence on foreign oil at a 20-year low. In Washington, if not in oil country right now, that’s a reason for feeling good. jon Sopel, BBC News, West Texas.

Eurozone finance ministers meet in the next few hours to try to reach a deal over Greece’s debt. Germany is still objecting to Greece’s request for a loan extension - but time is running out. ~ I think what you see now in this stand-off between the Eurozone and Greece is the risk of a full-blown crisis, which would do real damage to the European economy and it is a risk to Britain. Also this lunchtime: The UK economy shows its biggest surplus for seven years - the government says its plans to reduce the deficit are on track. There are claims that more Russian tanks and troops have crossed into Ukraine, violating the fragile ceasefire. Millions of pounds of private parking fines may be illegal- drivers could be in line for compensation. England are thrashed by New Zealand in the Cricket World Cup - in one of the quickest games Later on BBC London, the mayor goes underground to announce more Tube lines will benefit from 2li-hour services and Wendy will be here with a look at the weekend weather, a full forecast in half an hour. Good afternoon, welcome to BBC News at 1pm. Eurozone finance ministers meet in a few hours time in Brussels, to try to solve the crisis surrounding Greece’s bail-out. Greece has proposed a 6 month extension of its loan programme, instead of renewing its existing bailout deal - but Germany yesterday rejected that plan. The existing bailout deal expires at the end of the month - and Greece could run out of money without a new agreement. Gavin Lee reports. After days of diplomacy, today could be the day of reckoning for the anti-austerities Greek government. Desperate for more finances, they are asking Eurozone members for a six-month loan extension. That is in the hands of 18 finance ministers. It is basically up to the Greek people and the Greek government. And I think this is the meeting where we will hear whether they will agree to all the conditions or not. We are confident a deal is possible in the foreseeable future, if everybody is reasonable. But we are not there yet. Without the loan agreement Greece could run out of money and quickly too. What is at stake? In total Greece owes more than 320 billion euros, a huge 175% of the country’s GDP, it’s annual economic output. As a proportion it is one of the highest in the world. If you split the mountain of debt over the entire population, each person would owe 30,000 euros each. So far Greece has received 240 euros billion bailout. The majority of young people are unemployed. Greece’s current loan agreement expires next Saturday, what then? on the streets of Athens this morning there was deep uncertainty. TRANSLATION: I would like for Germany to try to understand Greece, of course we should pay the debt, that we should not live in poverty. Syriza will not be able to keep its commitments to the Greeks, I take this for granted. There are high stakes for other European leaders as well if Greece cannot meet its debt requirements. Speaking in London earlier today, Chancellor George Osborne gave a sombre assessment of the situation. I think what you see now in this stand-off between the Eurozone and Greece is the risk of a full-blown crisis that would do real damage to the European economy and is a risk to Britain. We need the Eurozone to find a common solution. Germany has voiced concern over whether the request is a Trojan horse agreement with Greece abandoning the austerity plan once it has more money. It’s suffered its position this morning describing the request as a starting point for further talks, but all sides are aware how much is riding on events today. We have will have the latest from Brussels in a moment, but first to Athens. To our correspondent in Athens - Mark Lowen. How much expectation is there that there will be some sort of agreement in Brussels? Certainly the Greek Prime Minister sounded confident this morning, Alexis Tsipras says that he is certain is’s demand will be accepted, talking about the need for a historic medical decision. There was frustration in the Greek government that the deal that was seemingly welcomed by Brussels was rejected by Berlin so quickly yesterday. This is no process of negotiation in which both sides are playing their hand and playing hardball, I can’t see Greece climbing down further from what it had promised before, as it has now accepted supervision, which it campaigned against before the election. But this is a process of negotiation, though neither side has the luxury of time on their hands, because it is no deal by the end of the month, this country could find itself unable to pay public sector salaries and pensions, unable to meet debt payments. It owes millions of euros later this month and could find its banks having their emergency funding from the Europeans in full bank cut off, it could move Greece towards the door of a Eurozone exit and that is something neither side wants to happen. Let’s speak to our correspondent Lucy Williamson who’s in Brussels. That is where those talks will get underway in the next couple of hours. We heard of slight softening on the part of Germany, but given everything Mark says, what are the prospects, what is the feeling where you are? Well, I think despite the tensions and the brinkmanship, a deal is still possible here, but it will not be easy. You mentioned German Chancellor Angela Merkel having spoken to the Greek Prime Minister last night, saying the Greek proposal, though insufficient, was a good starting point for talks, it was seen as a softener. This meeting has been pushed back by an hour and a half to allow time for more bilateral meetings for different members of the Eurozone to negotiate and find a way forward towards some kind of deal. But we are getting reports that the Maltese finance minister, for example, has been saying Germany is now in a position where if Greece wants to leave they will let Italy. It gives you an idea how tough this tightrope is that the Eurozone has to walk. Lucy Williamson and Mark Lowen, thank you. The Chancellor, George Osborne, says the government is on track to meet its borrowing and deficit forecasts for the financial year. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the Treasury received £8.8 billion more in tax receipts last month than it spent. Here’s our economics correspondent Andy Verity. Millions of self-employed people from gardeners to clean as did the Chancellor a favour last month, they paid their taxes for the whole year. As their payments went through, the government at last got billions more in income than it spent. That surplus injanuary was in income than it spent. That surplus in january was £8.8 surplus injanuary was £8.8 billion, thatis surplus injanuary was £8.8 billion, that is 2.3 billion more than the same month last year. That cut the amount the government had to borrow from April to january 274 billion. One reason the taxman collected more thisjanuary was witty One reason the taxman collected more this january was witty bonuses. In january last year the city put off paving january last year the city put off paying big bonuses, waiting for the top rate of tax to come down from 50p to 45. This year bonuses were paid and tax collected. Other taxes are proving. This month is exaggerated by self-assessment tax receipts for a previous year. Those are very high because of a change to income tax, which caused some people to move their income from one year to the next. There are distortions in this figure, but there are broader signs of improvement, corporation tax is rising strongly, VAT is rising pretty strongly and there are the first signs of wage growth turning up in data earlier this week. On the campaign trail this morning the Chancellor welcomes the latest numbers. These figures are really strong figures coming on top of a low rate of inflation, high rate of employment. Got lots of good news in our economy at the moment, we have a goal working for our long-term plan. The squeeze on people ‘s wages at a record level has undermined the health of the public finances, it is something the Conservatives don’t understand, they don’t understand the health of ordinary people’s household finances and living standards is essential to preparing public finances. That is where we feel the real economy issues are. The Treasury has long since given up on hitting the target for reducing the deficit, that it set itself five years ago. It is unlikely it will hit the target in the budget eczema, but that was revised in the Autumn statement, now it looks likely be easier target will be hit. -- it looks likely be easier target will be hit. -- in the budget it set itself. Let’s speak to our correspondent Ross Hawkins. A degree of good cheer for the Chancellor. Yes, he would like you to look back over the past we can find lots of things to be in good cheer about, find lots of things to be in good cheerabout, notjust find lots of things to be in good cheer about, notjust the public finance news today, but low unemployment and low inflation. It depends whether you look at the forecasts made at the Autumn statement, in which case he is pretty much on track for what he might have expected to get and what independent economists expected him to get. If you look back further to 2010, when he was promising to have Alan Brooks why now. Labour says you have to remember the promise that was not met. -- have to remember the promise that was not met. -- when he was promising to have balanced the books. The national debt is still rising, it is at EI.4 trillion. After the next election there will not be much money to give away whoever wins this economic argument. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel and the French President, Francois Hollande have been meeting in Paris this morning, to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. The talks come amid flagrant breaches of the ceasefire in several towns in the east of the country. Our correspondent Nick Childs has the latest. Theirs is an unenviable task, the international monitors with the job of tracking whether the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine has any chance of taking hold. Nearly a week now after it was meant to begin, both sides continue to exchange fire and accusations. The Ukrainian government’s military spokesman says more Russian weaponry, including tanks, has crossed the border since the ceasefire, and there’s been new shelling by pro-Russian rebels. Meanwhile, the rebels blamed the government for new attacks. TRANSLATION: In general, the situation along the whole frontline is gradually stabilising. Donetsk People’s Republic Army formations are adhering strictly to the ceasefire regime and are not giving in to isolated provocations by Ukrainian troops. The war-torn town of Debaltseve today, now in rebel hands. And the remaining desperate inhabitants have been queueing for aid. With the battle for this key town now over, the hope had been at the fighting would die down. The fear is that the rebels could try to grab more territory. Across the border, the Russian air force on manoeuvres. The West blames a newly aggressive and aggrieved Russia for stoking the Ukrainian conflict, something Moscow has always denied. Now with relations between Russia and the West at their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War, a hard-hitting House of Lords report has accused Britain and the European Union of sleepwalking into this crisis by taking their eye off Moscow and the mood there. We feel that, both in our Foreign Office and, as far as we can judge, in some others, they don’t have the same level of expertise on Russian affairs as they did in the days of the old Soviet Union. At the time of the Cold War when that was the biggest single strategic issue facing the West, there was a huge amount of expertise. In the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, they’ve been remembering the bloody crackdown a year ago by the then pro-Russian government of student protests, which sparked a conflict that has caused so much grief and suffering in Ukraine, and new international tensions beyond.

Research from the RAC Foundation suggests that thousands of drivers who’ve been given parking tickets on private land could be in line for compensation. The RAC says the penalties are unenforceable, and out of proportion to any losses suffered. Our correspondent Danjohnson is in Barnsley. Yes, jane, this is the type of car park we are talking about, private land and privately run. It is free but only for a limited time. There are cameras which clock the number plates of cars coming in and if you outstay your welcome there will be a letter and a fine in the post. The question being axed today is our those finds enforceable? -- question being axed today is our those finds enforceable? -- question being asked. Do you have to pay up? You park, you You p8Iâi(, yOU pay, You paIâi(, you pay, you You park, you pay, you stick to the time limit, it should be so simple, yet it is an issue guaranteed to get drivers talking. It is likely is issuing fines and stuff for if you go in like one minute, two minutes over your time. go in like one minute, two minutes overyourtime. I over your time. I don’t think people realise that I don’t think they have any power, these. My wife bought a disabled gentleman once, she was five minutes over the time and she got a fine. The fines are supposed to be compensation for losses offered by landowners, but many drivers feel the charges are disproportionate and the RAC foundation says they may not be legally enforceable. If you park in a public car park and pay nothing, even five -£10 an hour to park, it seems excessive to then be hit with a ticket for £100 when you overstate or break the terms and conditions. Perhaps not surprisingly the body which represents private parking enforcement companies sees things differently. It is about asking people to comply with the terms and conditions of the car park. Most of us do that, we hear a lot about people who get tickets, but most people when they park in a car park do so lawfully, safely and with consideration for other people. It is those very people who expect a level of enforcement against people who don’t. They both say they would welcome more clarity on the legal position. They may get it from a Court of Appeal case next week. And did issue. They have had to introduce a system where you type in your registration in at the checkout here. That is to prove that people are actually customers at the shops. That rule has been welcomed because it has stopped others parking here and going elsewhere. A couple dated issue. Everybody is wanted to know the definitive answer. -- complicated. Our top story this lunch time, Eurozone Finance Minister is a meeting in the next couple of hours to try to reach a deal over Greece’s debt. Germany is still objecting to a request for a loan extension. Still to come, the United States, turning fountains to ice, and causing car tyres to freeze. Coming up in the sport at half past, humiliation for England and another crushing defeat in the Cricket World Cup, losing to New Zealand by eight wickets. Los Angeles is making the final preparations for its glitziest night of the year. It’s the 87th Academy Awards on Sunday, and there’s plenty of British talent among the nominations. Eddie Redmayne has already won the Bafta and the Golden Globe for his performance as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything - will he come home with the Oscar as well? Well our Los Angeles Correspondent Alistair Leithead has gone behind the scenes to see how things are shaping up. And a warning- his report contains flashing images. After weeks of grins, frocks and flashbulbs, the culmination of the annual awards season is almost upon us. The big question, will Eddie Redmayne win best actor? When you make films, it’s so out of your control. You always pour your heart into everything that you do, but there’s an alchemy that happens in film-making and it sometimes works, it sometimes doesn’t. He was humble a few weeks ago but, come on, you’d love an Oscar, Eddie! Let’s make a comeback. Unless, of course, Michael Keaton’s Birdman swoops in to take the gong. Those are the two top picks. The gloss seems to have come off Benedict Cumberbatch’s chances, but Bradley Cooper is making a strong finish with the bookies. I think Michael Keaton has the sympathy vote, I think Eddie Redmayne gives the best performance, and Bradley Cooper has been nominated every year for three years, he’s probably due it as well. I’ve got a military age male on a cellphone. American Sniper has made so much money that you almost wonder if that’s going to tip it over the edge and the Academy’s going to love it for that. In terms of the top prize, Best Movie, Boyhood’s also well placed for a gong. Well, it did take them 12 years to make. The carpet is almost down, the preparation is moving swiftly as everyone is working towards the big night. Wolfgang Puck, people have been starving themselves for months. So, what’s their reward at the end of it? Everybody’s going to get a golden Oscar, but it’s chocolate. If we don’t give it to them, people will ask for it. So now we wrap them up, put them in a little box, so people can take them home as a souvenir. Do you enjoy this? It’s always a great event for Los Angeles. We don’t have the Queen coming for dinner or anything like that, we just have the Oscars. The Oscars cost an absolute fortune to put on. Not just all this preparation, but the hidden money, the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent lobbying to attract the attention of the Academy which, incidentally, is more than 90% white, three quarters ITIEFI and aI’I aVâI’agâ age of OVEF 60. If you look at the top category of Best Picture, I think five of them are biopics about white, famous men. I mean, you look at that and there’s no way you can even question that there’s inherent bias towards people awarding films that represent themselves. The winners are still under wraps, and all will soon be revealed. And then Hollywood can get back to the hard work. It’s all uphill to next year’s Academy Awards. Alastair Leithead, BBC News, Los Angeles. Peter Mandelson, the former Labour minister in charge of universities, says they will have to be compensated if Labour cuts tuition fees. The BBC understands that there’s still no agreement how to finance the reduction. Let’s get more from our political correspondent, Iain Watson. It is all about Labour wanting students to come out of university with less debt than they otherwise might. But it is how you pay for it. That is absolutely right. Labour say they are going to give us their policy shortly, but the difficulty has been that Ed Miliband said in 2011 he wanted to cut fees from £9,000 to £6,000 in England. Head of the general election, he will have to tell us how he is going to pay for that. to tell us how he is going to pay forthat. Peter for that. Peter Mandelson offered friendly for that. Peter Mandelson offered friendly advice to his party today, saying that perhaps there ought to be more consultation and deliberation. In other words, take the complex policy into the long grass and deal with it after the general election. Labour are determined to announce cuts, his key message message today was, don’t do this at the expense of university funding. If the taxpayer has to make the shortfall, tell us before the election had that will be done. One option is perhaps cutting fees for just some courses, science, technology, engineering, maths. That might save the money at the Business Secretary says that actually these are very expensive courses and will not save us any money at all. Labour are saying that the last few years under this government that leaves them no option other than to change this system and they will announce that change. A care worker has admitted trying to murder three colleagues at a care home in the West Midlands. Melissa Smith was arrested last August after staff and patients fell ill. Our correspondent has been following the case. It is pretty grim details. Explain what has happened. It all began last summer injune when Melissa Swift Tom also a special constable, started sending anonymous letters to her elder sister, Lula and to a work colleague, Charlotte Dixon. She sprayed them with blood and made threats against lives. At the end of july, she started to add bleach to communal drinks at the Gold court care home in West Bromwich. In the juice and water. 32 people were taken ill. The most serious case, a person suffered strokelike symptoms. Others suffered sickness and diarrhoea. They have since fully recovered. Today, she stood in the dock and answered guilty to three charges of attempted murder and two of making threats to kill. The police said these were heinous crimes and they do not know why she did it. Perhaps we will find out when she comes back in here in April to be sentenced. Every week at least 12 young people die in the UK from an undiagnosed heart condition. Researchers hope a new study could reduce that number, by investigating how exercise affects young hearts. Our correspondent john Maguire reports. When you were quiet and lying on the couch before it was around 80. Your heart rate has already gone up. Because you are cycling. It may not look as if 14-year-old Luke is working hard but he is and as the doctor increases the resistance than his heart is working harder too. This level of exertion would have been impossible for him 18 months ago. Luke was born with a congenital heart defect, but recent surgery has changed his life. I found it difficult to breathe whilst exercising hard. My stamina was not very good. Since the operation it has been brilliant. I have been a lot fitter. I have been out there and able to do more stuff. I play a bit of rugby and skateboard. This research project is trying to discover more about how children’s hearts behave during exercise. Three groups are being studied, those like Luke with heart problems, a group without including Toby and Molly from Exeter, and thirdly, young players at Manchester United. To perform in elite sport players have do push themselves. We are very much aware that their health is potentially at risk. It is known that sudden cardiac deaths are of higher frequency in elite athletes than in the normal population. So hopefully this project will allow us and our players to perform in a more safe environment. It is the first time that children’s hearts have been monitored using an echocardiogram, just like an ultrasound, while they are exercising and not at rest. Because we are trying to find and implement protocols that within the next five years could actually be lamented within the NHS care, and lead to an earlier diagnosis of heart dysfunction in patients. ~ -- be implemented. Learning more about younger hearts may help to protect children as they become adults. This isjames Phillips, pictured with his brother and sister, outwardly healthy but he collapsed and died whilst running in a half marathon in September. There are hundreds of sudden cardiac deaths in young people each year and james was just 27. We’re pretty sure that had he not run the marathon, the half marathon, he would still be alive. If he’d played football he would probably still be alive. Individuals should not take part in these events that will push them beyond their comfort zone, let’s say, unless they are screened. He was running to raise money for a good cause. He lost his life. The hope is that this research will be able to tell us more about how young hearts cope with sport. It should help people to exercise safely and could help to prevent search sudden and such tragic deaths. ~ -- such sudden. More than 10 million people tuned in last night to watch EastEnders’ murder mystery reach its climax, with viewers finally discovering who killed Lucy Beale. After a long-running storyline, Lucy’s young brother Bobby was finally revealed as the killer. Our correspondent Keith Doyle was watching. It was live, it was shocking and almost 12 million of us tuned in to see who killed Lucy Beale. This cliffhanger came at the end of a dramatic week for the soap, marking its 30th anniversary. As millions wondered who’d done it, it was finally revealed as Lucy’s little brother Bobby. Whatever she says, she started it. She made everyone unhappy. This is what we love about Eastenders and soaps in general. Eastenders does it well. A proper with anger, a mystery. Characters that we loved wrap-up -- with anger, a mystery. Characters that we loved wrap-up -- wrapped up in it. We have been gripped for months. Producers and viewers love a cliffhanger. It seems half the world wondered who shotjR in the 80s. And then there was the body under the patio in Brookside and Coronation Street had 30 years of murderous clip hangers -- Street had 30 years of murderous clip hangers -- cliffhangers. Remember Richard Hillman and his murdering spree? It is a perilous world living in a TV soap. You are far more likely to get murdered than anywhere else in the real world. Hollyoaks is a dangerous place to live. Seven people died in one episode. Eastenders and Coronation Street murder someone every couple of years. On the other hand, no one has been murdered on the archers. Although plenty have perished in other ways. Although plenty have perished in otherways. Last other ways. Last night’s viewing figures followed a media blitz that got everyone talking. There were 1 million tweets, many to Bobby Beale in California, wanted to know why she had killed Lucy. I had no clue untill she had killed Lucy. I had no clue until I got tweets asking why Ike killed her. Iwas until I got tweets asking why Ike killed her. I was pretty confused because I thought it was talking about my dog, echoes my dog is called Lucy. Podcast is outdoor event viewing and last night was certainly that. What’s more, it seems people wanted to watch live rather than record it, so the story had a script. But how is Eastenders going to top that? Tonight, it is all live and we will find out if Bobby knew what he was doing, how much did jane really know, and Cathy is not dead, she is back! Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Eurozone finance minsters meet in the next few hours to try to reach a deal over Greece’s debt. Germany is still objecting to the request for a loan extension. In a moment, the weather- plus the news where you are. But first sport with Lizzie Greenwood Hughes at the BBC Sports Centre. Not all of the news is good for cricket fans. Thanks very much. Good afternoon. England’s one day cricket Captain Eoin Morgan says his side ‘will not panic’ after their embarrassing 8 wicket defeat to New Zealand. It equals their worst-ever one day loss and leaves them bottom of their pool. Tim Hague reports. This game was an opportunity for a to put a thrashing by Australia to bed, the problem was they were left sleeping by New Zealand as Tim Southee got the first of his seven wickets. Man after man was sent on his way in a classic English collapse. The last seven wickets fell for 19 runs. Paula joe Root, who top scored with 46, utterly helpless. While being bowled out for 123 was awful, it got even worse, England were whacked about from pillar to post. Kiwi skipper Brendon McCullum within 18 ball half-century, the fastest in World Cup history, a total car crash for England. McCullum’s men finished the job for him with ease, the co-host reaching their target injust 2.2 overs, the shortest one-day international chase against England in history as this day and night game was all over for the lights were even switched on. -- game was all over for the lights were even switched on. -- before the lights. We should not be beaten by this amount, no way, maybe today we were out skilled, but certainly the first game we played against Australia we were well below par. We are not doing the basics right, not reproducing what we practice. Souleyman S will be invited to watch a game at Chelsea. I felt ashamed when I knew what happened. But I repeat, I am a proud Chelsea football club manager because I know what the club is. And these people don’t represent the club. Great Britain’s grip on track cycling loosened slightly on day 2 of this year’s World Cup as both the men’s and women’s pursuit teams had to settle for silver in Paris.Patrick Gearey reports. Stage left is an uncomfortable, unfamiliar place for British cyclists, second is no consolation for a team used to listening to somebody else’s anthem on the podium. Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, joanna Trott and Katie Razzall are unbeaten in four years in the team pursuit, going for a fifth straight gold. -- in the team pursuit, going for a fifth straight gold. -- Katie Razzall. It is gold for Australia and a new world record time. The world record that had been broken was British. Australia went three seconds quicker. This feels like a landmark. The men’s four led New Zealand at one stage of their final, but the men in Black had one last move in them, a dash to the line snatched gold. This time a British second was an achievement given their tortuous road to these championships. A month ago we had a nasty crash, lying in the road with a broken collarbone, at that point in time we did not think we would be here. Cycling is a British sport success story, these results don’t change that, but they are in for a tough ride than ever before. And an 11 year old Celtic fan has beaten Scotland’s professional footballers to win january’s Goal of the Month award. jay Beatty, who has Downs Sydrome, won 97% of the online vote - after scoring a penalty during the half time break at Parkhead. Beatty shot to fame last year when Giorgios Samaras picked him to celebrate their league title. ~ Iam very I am very happy to announce iam to aI’1I’1OUIâ1Câ you you won the goal of the month. Well done, Paul, greatjob. I miss you, and I love you. See you. Very cold weather continues to grip the eastern part of the United States, temperatures have plummeted many degrees below the average for February. Sarah Corker has more. Temperatures have fallen so low so fast, this car in Maryland was frozen to the road after a water main burst. As the Arctic air sweeps across the eastern United States, the cold weather is breaking records from Boston to Miami. In New York state there is a new landmark, this fountain transformed into an ice volcano 50 feet high and growing. It has been an exceptional year the long cold spell, it has not been above freezing for a while.

It is all relative, we are doing well. Some cloud caught up in the jet stream, nowhere near us. Towards the south-east we have an area of cloud big enough to produce the odd bit of rain. Further north, a speckling of cloud is producing showers, a feature off on morning weather. -- of the morning weather. This was in the Doncaster area, some lovely blue skies, there are blue skies to be had. Away from the rain area in the south-east and those hefty showers across the north-western quarter of the British Isles, that is where we see the most intense rainfall. Above 300 metres wintry in nature. They will keep hammering down those temperatures. Elsewhere with sunshine it is not the warmest of days. A lot of dry weather around, western parts more likely to see more than theirfair western parts more likely to see more than their fair share of showers. Towards the south-east, this rain, should you see it, should stick around for a while through the afternoon, indeed, into the early part of the evening. It quit the scene too late in the day. As things cool off those showers are wintry in nature, you will see significant accumulations. It will be quite a chilly night, watch out for ice around. It will be a frosty start for many, it converts into a decent start to the weekend. Cold, yes, but bright. There will be sunshine, showers wintry in nature across higher ground. Sunday is a different kettle of fish. It is a chill north-westerly, if you don’t have high ground screaming the showers to the west, you will be exposed to many of those showers, wintry across the high ground, one or two percolating through the Midlands, one or two to the south-east, but the bigger picture is a dry afternoon in prospect. That converts into a chilly night with clear skies. The reason for the change lurking behind me, wet and windy weather. Significant snow on the high ground across northern Britain, I am stopping things around midday, thatis I am stopping things around midday, that is the extent of it, then into the afternoon. It gets across to the eastern side of the British Isles. Relatively mild conditions there, but next week we are in for a cold start, it is really very windy. Potentially disruptively so, lots of isobars on that chart. That is all from us on BBC One, time for the news wherever you are. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Alex Bushill. More 24-hour services on the Underground have been announced by the Mayor as part of a package of measures to boost investment in the capital. Borisjohnson wasjoined by the Chancellor to view maintenance work on the Underground early this morning. They announced a six point plan which included extending night tubes onto more lines including the Overground. Rail Unions have described the move as a ‘pre-election stunt’ as our Political Editor Tim Donovan reports. A meeting after midnight Underground. The Chancellor and May are seeing some of the engineering work being done on the Victoria line. -- work being done on the Victoria line. -- mayor. They had a go with a track laying machine, this was laying the ground for an announcement of five more Tube lines to get 24 hours services on Fridays and Saturdays. Much of London Overground would get the same. What George Osborne is saying is that they are going which will enable us to have 24 hour Tube service, not just on the central and northern lines, as we have already promised, but now on the subsurface line, the district line, Circle line, Hammersmith and city and Metropolitan. These late running Tube services will not happen until 2021, some said it was a pledge without credibility. I have not got a crystal ball, Boris appears to have one, he is making a commitment for 2021, have one, he is making a commitment for2021, he for 2021, he will no longer be mayor. Sounds fantastic, can the May deliver? This announcement will come ",,
109,BBC News 24,20-feb-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"Police fear three missing schoolgirls from east London have gone to Syria to join Islamic State. The girls, aged just 15 and 16, left from Gatwick Airport three days ago. Police say they’re extremely vulnerable. This all we know is the three girls have travelled of their own volition against the wishes of their parents, without telling their parents, and they are in danger. We’ll be hearing live from our correspondent at the school where the three girls are pupils. Also tonight: Signs of progress as Greece’s finance minister holds intensive talks in Brussels to find a way out of the country’s debt crisis. Caught on film trying to evade justice - the criminals being captured by police wearing body cameras. The Mafia man in hiding in London for 20 years - now a judge extradites him to Italy. And young performers with disabilities from North Korea come to Oxford, performing outside their country for the first time ever. On BBC London: The government announces its economic plan for the capital- including more 24 hour tube services. And a teacher from a prestigious music school isjailed for 11 years for raping two pupils. Good evening. Three missing schoolgirls from east London are feared by police to be travelling to Syria via Turkey to join so-called Islamic State. Shamima Begum, who’sjust 15, Kadiza Sultana, who’s 16, and an unnamed 15-year-old friend flew to Turkey from Gatwick Airport on Tuesday without leaving any messages for family or friends. The head of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terror Command said the runaways are good friends with another 15-year-old girl who travelled to Syria in December. Here’s our home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford. The three girls, friends and all in the same year at school, were recorded on CCTV heading into Gatwick Airport on Tuesday morning. Shamima Begum isjust 15 but could be on her way tojoin Shamima Begum isjust 15 but could be on her way to join the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. With her, her 16-year-old friend Kadiza Sultana. Both are British Bangladeshis and both were successful at school, as is the third friend, also 15, but whose family don’t want her to be identified. Officers are appealing for them to phone home or contact the police in Turkey. We are concerned they may go into Syria, where they can be connected with the terrorist group calling itself Islamic state. We are aware, as many people are, of the treatment of girls and women currently in that part of Syria. The prospect is not good and we want to prevent them getting there. We want to bring these children back. The friends all went to this school, the Bethnal Green Academy in east London, where it’s currently half term. They left home on Tuesday morning having lied to their parents about where they were going. They boarded a Turkish airlines plane for Istanbul, the same route to Syria taken by a fourth school friend in December. This teenage boy, who spoke anonymously outside school, is a friend of one of the families. Really sad what’s happened. The government should try its best to help in anyway and find out what happened. Turkey is currently being plagued by savage winter weather, which has caused travel chaos. Detectives are hoping the girls haven’t yet made it to the Syrian border. This is the first time Scotland Yard has gone public with the names of teenaged girls who have travelled to Syria. It’s a sign of how concerned they are about their safety and how worried they are about the growing phenomenon of jihadi brides. It’s thought more than 50 British women and hundreds from other western European countries have already travelled to join Islamic State, often encouraged on social media by men wanting wives or other women who have already made the journey. or other women who have already made thejourney. But the journey. But given the treatment of women in the Islamic State, what’s the appeal? It’s difficult to understand why a teenage girl would want to do that, but for a jihadist teenage girl, somebody who believes in Islamic State, this is good, this is how God would want humans to live on Earth. The idea of willingly subjugating yourself to a strange man who is fighting for a strange cause, that’s not alien to them. The families of the girls are said to be desperate and they are hoping that somebody can help the police to track them down before they cross the into Syria. Daniel is that Bethnal Green Academy in London. How concerned are police that the girls all came from the same school? It is absolutely extraordinary that four girls should have gone from the same year at the same school out to Syria, apparently to try to join Islamic State. It looks like the connection between them and the school is simply that this is where the girls had met and become friends. It doesn’t look like the school is implicated in any kind of radicalisation and certainly the school is rated outstanding by Ofsted and has a very good reputation. There are a couple of difficult questions this evening. First, how is it that Turkish airlines allowed three girls aged 15 and 16 to board a flight to Turkey, the known route into Syria, without asking questions or raising alarms with the police. And how is it that one girl having travelled from this school in December to join one girl having travelled from this school in December tojoin Islamic state, that her friends, school in December tojoin Islamic state, that herfriends, herfamily and the police haven’t managed to dissuade her three best friends from going and joining her. Thank you. Eurozone finance ministers are locked in talks in Brussels, as efforts continue to try to find a solution to the Greek debt crisis. Greece yesterday requested a new six-month bailout, which Germany rejected. But there were signs today of a more conciliatory tone after the German Chancellor spoke by phone to the Greek Prime Minister. Our Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt, is in Brussels. Some positive signs? Yes. Every minister arriving here knew they were discussing notjust the minister arriving here knew they were discussing not just the future of Greece, but the future of the Eurozone. The man chairing the meeting said he was optimistic, but he thought it would be difficult. There are indications tonight that the meeting might be closing in on a deal. I understand they have a draft agreement which they are going through, paragraph by paragraph. In Athens, in Brussels, in Berlin, everyone is aware the deadline is approaching, when Greece must either reach an agreement on its bailout or risk running out of money. At today’s key meeting in Brussels, the Greeks arrived and they wanted to underline that they had already made big concessions. The Greek government has gone the extra mile, the extra ten miles, and now we expect our partners to meet us not halfway, but one fifth of the way. Hopefully at the end of this we’ll come out with some white smoke. Germany has rejected the Greek plan is full of loopholes. They want Athens to stick to the original bailout plan with its austerity measures. (TRANSLATION) we need to be able to trust each other. The trust of people in all European countries in the European project can be strengthened. This is what we are working hard to achieve. What is the big divide? The Greeks requested an extension of the bailout, they promised no extra spending without approval and they signed up to supervision. But the Germans remained wary. They believed the Greeks wanted the extra financing without committing to the austerity conditions that game with it and those divisions are reflected on the streets of Athens and Berlin. The other European countries must understand what we passed through last year. And make compromises. The problem is not Greece. Greece is the victim. The problem is a European problem. In Berlin the mood was less accommodating. If you give the Greeks more and more and so never change their opinion, it’s no good. There have to be limits. The way they have acted with their economy, I don’t think it’s OK. The Greek crisis was top of the agenda when the joy and -- crisis was top of the agenda when thejoy and -- Germany crisis was top of the agenda when the joy and -- Germany Chancellor arrived to meet the French President. She was clear, Greece had to provide more detail about how it would run its budget. (TRANSLATION) for an extension of the bailout programme we need significant improvement so we can tell people in other countries what it all means. There are still details that need answering. President Hollande struck a rather different note. (TRANSLATION) Greece is in the Eurozone and it must remain in the Eurozone. I know of no scenario today involving a Eurozone exit. If there is to be a deal here, Greece will have to make further concessions over running a tight budget. If they fail, Greece will be one step closer to leaving the Eurozone and will lose its financial lifeline. The Chancellor, George Osborne, has said the government is on track to meet its borrowing and deficit forecasts for the financial year. Official figures show that january recorded the highest monthly surplus since before the financial crisis, with income exceeding spending by £8.8 billion. But Labour said Mr Osborne had broken his promise to balance the books by this year. Our economics correspondent, Andy Verity, is here. Thanks. january is by far the best month of the year for the taxman because it’s when self-employed people pay their taxes for the whole year so as their payments go through, the government - unusually - collects more in taxes than it spends. Today we found out that january surplus was £8.8 billion. That’s up by more than £2 billion compared to the same month last year. What counts, though, is the whole financial year. So far, the government’s got a deficit of £7lI billion - in other words, it’s overspent its income by that much. That’s less than last year, the Conservatives would point out. For the whole year, the official forecast is an overspend of £91.3 billion. So will the Chancellor hit that target? Before today the figures suggested receipts were coming in less quickly this year than George Osborne needed to achieve his targets of the year. Today’s figures suggest that picture is reversed. We were expecting january’s receipts to be strong. The OBR was expecting strong receipts from capital gains tax and income tax. What Labour would point out, though, is that target’s been a moving one and lately it’s got a lot easier to hit. Back in 2010, the plan was that by this financial year, he’d spend only £37 billion more than he got in taxes. But by late 2011, after the Eurozone crisis began, that had more than doubled - an overspend of £79 billion. And by the Autumn Statement in December, the forecast shifted up again to £91.3 billion - a much easier target to hit. You can expect the politicians to carry on arguing about how fast the deficit needs to be cut. But Reeta, whoever’s in power three months from now, you can expect the government to outspend its income for at least the next three years. A renowned classical musician has been jailed for 11 years for the rape and sexual assault of students while teaching at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Philip Pickett, who’s 64, carried out the attacks in the 1970s and '80s in sound-proof practice rooms. The judge at the Old Bailey described his crimes as a ""gross abuse of trust"". The Ukrainian capital, Kiev, is marking the first anniversary of the clashes between protesters and police which toppled ex-President Viktor Yanukovych. More than 100 people died in the violence on the Maidan - Kiev’s central Independence Square - a year ago. One of the towns engulfed by the ensuing violence is the strategically important town of Debaltseve. Our World Affairs Correspondent Paul Adams has reached the town - and he sent this report After nine months of this war, the landscape is littered with its twisted remains. Here on the road to Debaltseve, the Ukrainian army fought off the rebel advance their wigs. Three days ago the checkpoint fell, and the town soon followed. This was a ferocious assault for all their abandoned hardware, the Ukrainian soldiers here were simply overwhelmed. The victors scavenge through the wreckage. Most are from eastern Ukraine, but there’s at least one Russian here. There’s unexploded ammunition everywhere. Out in the fields, minds to get rid of. -- mine Out in the fields, minds to get rid of.-- mine humour. We Out in the fields, minds to get rid of. -- mine humour. We move on into Debaltseve. It hasn’t been flattened, but weeks of shelling have taken their toll. The rebels are everywhere, but the town is eerily quiet. This is the central street in Debaltseve and it’s practically deserted but for a handful of civilians and quite a few soldiers. This town hasn’t had gas, water or electricity since just after the New Year. Many people are still living in underground shelters, afraid to come out and we can still hear the sound of occasional artillery fire. This part of Debaltseve is a bit of a ghost town. (TRANSLATION) Ithink of Debaltseve is a bit of a ghost town. (TRANSLATION) I think you can see it on my face. We were in total shock. My child couldn’t speak after all of this. She’s scared of everything now. After weeks of living underground, she has come back -- living underground, she has come back -- Aleksei has come back to check on his house. A shell exploded outside. His neighbour says they are tired of replacing broken windows. (TRANSLATION) everything is ruined. The Ukrainian national guard hit us with shells from over there. Who do you blame for this destruction? The Russians. Alexey says it’s all the fault of Ukraine’s president. On the road out of Debaltseve, victorious rebels are leaving, job done. They are in confident mood. Where that confidence will take them next is anyone’s guess. Our top story this evening. Police fear three missing schoolgirls from east London have gone to Syria to join Islamic State. And still to come. CHEERING A humiliating start to England’s Cricket World Cup campaign. Later on BBC London. The Mayor of Tower Hamlets gives evidence at the High Court over allegations of electoral fraud during last year’s mayoral contest. And does London really need a new state of the art Concert Hall - where the world’s greatest musicians can perform? Glasgow film Festival shows the Internet ‘s best cat videos. An increasing number of police forces in England and Wales are using body and helmet-worn cameras to help catch criminals and to deter crime. The BBC has obtained figures from the University of Portsmouth, where researchers spent a year studying police on the Isle of Wight - all of whom now wear body cameras. They found assaults on police fell by over a third - from 76 to A9. Public order and assault crimes were down 18% per cent from from just over 1700 to 1400. Today at Winchester Crown Court, a man was convicted of an assault on a female police officer- caught on camera. Duncan Kennedy is there. Duncan? Well, this research is the first of its kind ever carried out in England and Wales and the results are striking. Particularly figures on the reduction of the number of assaults on police officers wearing body cameras. It also feeds into the debate about whether the police should be issued with these cameras in the first place. Today a 25-year-old man was jailed at Winchester Crown Court for attacking a female police officer who was wearing one of these cameras. I should warn you, my report contains strong images. This is Craig Rad born handcuffed in the back of a police car, what happens next is shocking. He lunges at the officer. It is all caught on her body mounted camera. He’s seen banging the Sergeant’s head on the floor repeatedly. She’s on her run, and her gasps for air be heard. The repeatedly. She’s on her run, and her gasps forair be heard. The man eventually ran off. -- her gasps forair be heard. The man eventually ran off. -- can be heard. Today a judge jailed him for three years saying that the video was nothing short of sickening. The police officer said she thought she was going to die but has now recovered and she’s back at work. She was wearing one of these body mounted cameras. It did not stop the attack on her but today’s research shows overall assaults on officers wearing them are down by more than one third. Where it is used for those sort of offences, the ones which make the public afraid, it has a big impact on reassurance. Police body cameras are recording events never seen before. Evidence that might have been challenged is now much more solid. I’ve heard nothing to suggest that the public are concerned about the use of body BDO cameras, it is incident specific and in normal confident the leek conversation would not be recorded. -- body cameras. Weather in Britain of America, public support for the cameras seems to be strong but it is not universal. I don’t see why they shouldn’t, it backs up what they claim in court and clarifies things. It is against your human rights. You are not aware you are filmed. This Hampshire attack captures the brutality please work, while some may object to being filmed, the new research shows body cameras are helping to reduce crime. -- research shows body cameras are helping to reduce crime. -- the brutality of police work. He’d been living under an assumed name in west London for twenty years - but finally the law has caught up with Domenico Rancadore. Ajudge has ordered the extradition of the convicted Mafia member to Italy - where he’s due to serve a seven year sentence. Clive Coleman has more. Domenico Rancadore, a man who doesn’t care for the cameras. How do you feel? Not well, sorry. Arriving at court with his wife to learn whether he is to be extradited to Italy. Once a teacher and known as the Professor, the Italian police say his crime family was involved in extortion, racketeering and drug trafficking. In 1999, the was convicted in absence of being a member of the Sicilian Mafia. -- convicted in absence of being a member of the Sicilian Mafia. -- he was convicted. But he was nowhere to be found. For 20 years he lived in Uxbridge, west London, underthe name Mark Skinner. But Domenico Rancadore’s quiet suburban life came to an abrupt end here in August 2013. When the police turned up with an arrest warrant. His past had finally caught up with him. This priest spoke out about organised crime in Sicily and says he fell foul of Rancadore, and his henchmen. TRANSLATION: The police rang us, they woke us up and I went out of the door and the police captain said, look, Father, Iturned to the door and the police captain said, look, Father, I turned to my right and saw a dead lamb hanging, I understood things were taking a turn for the worse, the sign said this is how you will end up. There is no doubt that Rancadore was an integral part of these threats that I received. This is the second time the Italian authorities have tried to extradite Rancadore. He argued that amounted to an abuse of the law. Today the judge disagreed. Your reaction to the decision? I’m very disappointed. You will be appealing. I don’t want to go to Italy. If his appeal fails, I don’t want to go to Italy. If his appealfails, Rancadore appeal fails, Rancadore faces seven years in an Italianjail. It will be a far cry from Uxbridge. Tonight, a group of disabled performers from North Korea are visiting the University of Oxford on a European tour. It’s believed to be the first time any disabled performers from the secretive state have allowed to perform outside their country. It’s hoped it signals a change in the regime’s attitude to disabled people - and that they’re beginning to receive better treatment. From Oxford, Sarah Campbell reports. A last chance to perfect their performance. SINGING This 13-year-old lost his legs three years ago in a car accident. For all but one of the students this is their first time outside North Korea. They arrived yesterday requesting as their first meal, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. I asked this 21-year-old, and this 20-year-old, what they wanted this tour to show. TRANSLATION: Somebody who’s like me, blind, can perform as a normal person and I will prove that. We should perform trips like that, to show we can perform, and we can do stuff like others. Ordinary people. They get the right correct answer about disabled people. Discovering the correct answer about any aspect of North Korea is almost impossible. Foreign filming is generally undercover and few dare to speak out against the regime. Those that do tell a different story to the carefully controlled images which are allowed to be filmed. If you have a disabled child the authorities will come and try to remove the child, or expel you from Pyongyang to the countryside where conditions are harder. These things are not verified, but they are from a number of sources. One can only assume they have a basis of truth. That is disputed by the group behind this trip, a group supported financially by the North Korean government. There are some rumours against the disability people in my country, I would like to introduce the reality of my country on the disability issues. You can send these rumours are not true? Not true. All of the performers here have a disability and they talk positively about their treatment in North Korea. The organisers are keen to stress these are not all students from privileged backgrounds but the fact is very few ordinary North Koreans would be allowed out of the country. SINGING Whatever the agenda this tour at the very least provides a rare opportunity to meet face-to-face the people from this most secret of societies. England suffered a humiliating 8 wicket thrashing by New Zealand in the World Cup. England were all out for a mere 123 runs, with the last seven wickets falling forjust 19 runs. And Kiwi bowler Tim Southee became only the fourth man ever in a World Cup match to take seven wickets. Patrick Geary reports. This was supposed to have a floodlit finale, England could not even take it to Twilight. New Zealand finished in shades and with their opponents in a very dark place. We knew these would be difficult games, playing against the favourites in their home conditions, but we shouldn’t be beaten by this amount. Morgan had chosen to bat but his logic was shattered along with his opening batsman stumps. Tim Southee, befuddling Ian Bell and Moeen Ali. England’s captain tried to seize back the initiative, but there was no escaping the men in Black. Morgan gone, 17. CHEERING More often than not, Tim Southee did not require fielders, onlyjoe Root escaping with some dignity. But Tim Southee was wreaking havoc at the other end, he took his seventh wicket and evenjoe Root seems other end, he took his seventh wicket and even joe Root seems to lose hope. Brendon McCullum was so keen on an evening off he hit the fastest 50 in the tournament ‘s history. The chase tookjust over 12 overs. Brendon McCullum came out and slaughtered our bowling, he smashed it all over the park. Really, he made a bad day into one of the worst cricket days England have ever had. In one-day cricket. England may yet qualify for the quarterfinals but this defeat will linger, it may prove difficult to forget their Wellington booting. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s john Hammond.

It will be cold, a chilly night with a widespread frost first thing on Sunday morning. It’s all change because this system comes in from the West. A period of snow in Northern Ireland. As this system moves east there is the chance of snow over Scotland, on high and low ground. Could be an issue north of the central belt. Snow for the hills of northern England. Rain further south through England and Wales, it will be a bright start in the East. Frosty, with some sunshine. It will take all day for the rain to arrive from the West. Strong windy conditions. All in all, it won’t feel pleasant. Cold across the North, briefly milder across the South.

Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. 24-hour services on the London Underground are to be expanded to other lines and extended to London Overground and the Docklands Light Railway by 2021. Those are some of the measures announced by the Mayor and the Chancellor as part of a package to boost investment in the capital.

It will also happen on these lines... It will not come into operation until 2021 which leads some to question the credibility of this pledge. Boris is making a commitment for 2021. He will no longer be Mayor of London. It sounds absolutely fantastic but can the mayor deliver? The announcement says 2021 which is well after Boris johnson and the Chancellor will have left office. It is pledged later trains will also run on overground services from 2017 but no agreement yet with staff. More significant than the promise of later running trains were the positive signals from the Chancellor on transport investment generally.

I was encouraged that we had from the person presumably in charge of spending in this country, the Chancellor, he was making those commitments, talking about Crossrail and Tube upgrades.

Transport officials and business figures said the Chancellor had pledged more than they expected. He can hardly go back on that now. Also part of the proposals was more help for housing in the capital. In Edgware the Mayor announced what he called a ‘Domesday Book’ of public land to be earmarked for new housing. He hopes this will help develop London’s brownfield sites and create 400,000 new homes over the next decade. Our political correspondent Karl Mercer was with the Mayor in Harrow. A housing scheme, in Harrow. 75 days before the election. Frankly you wouldn’t want either of these two anywhere near your plastering but they were keen to put on a united front this morning. What could possibly go wrong asks the mayor? Well, on a day of promises of money for London, came another one they’ll have to keep - of £400 million for nine so-called housing zones in the capital. The promise of more new homes for London though - one we’ve heard plenty of before. Is 22,000, when will we get that? We’re next elevating and building more than ever before. We heard good news this morning, we will speed up the planning process. That will be tough sometimes with some people say in it is too much central power but we will work with the borough is to make sure that all goes well. One of the new zones will be here in Harrow. With the local council getting £30 million for new housing. Some will be used to knock down its town hall. Eventually 1200 homes could go here. It certainly is welcome. This funding will help regenerate Harrell and have the biggest house-building project we have had in a generation. -- regenerate housing. It’s true London is building more homes than for about 25 years. It’s also true that it’s not building enough to keep up with its growing population. joyjosiah is one of those wanting a new home. But like many, unable to keep up with London’s spiralling prices. It is frustrating because I work and I want to provide for my children. I want my children to have their own space. As they get older, being in such a small place is not good for them. She’s hoping to swap her home for a bigger one through housing association Peabody. Which is itself building homes in some of the new housing zones. The new money will help it says. But won’t be an immediate fix. Quite clearly we need a lot more housing in London and a lot more public investment, if that can be found, to make it affordable for people on low incomes. It will be hard to build enough homes, that enough people can afford quickly enough - whatever has been announced today. Coming up later in the programme: And the baby named after the First World War battle. A teacher from a prestigious music school has been jailed for eleven years for raping two of his students and indecently assaulting another during the ‘70s and ‘80s. 64 year-old Philip Pickett taught for 25 years at the Guildhall School of Drama in London. The Old Bailey heard how he lured vulnerable pupils into practice rooms which were soundproof. This report from our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake. ~ Iam sure I am sure I have seen you before at one of our many productions... For more than 25 years, Philip Pickett travelled the world performing as a classical musician. Thousands came to see and play and conduct, but his audiences had no idea he was hiding a secret, he was a rate this. He started an 11 year prison sentence today for attacking three students here at the Guildhall music school. He was an accomplished professor and had vulnerable girls who came to be taught by him and he appears that position, knowing they would find it difficult to report it to the authorities at the time. He rates a 16-year-old girl more than 30 years ago, but she only reported it after the jimmy Savile scandal broke. Another girl came forward to say he had also attacked her in 1978, locking the door of the soundproof classroom and turning off the lights and beginning his attack. He indecently assaulted a 17-year-old girl. She told her parents and they wrote to the Guildhall School of music and drama. Eventually they got a response saying no one else had complained about him as perhaps they should consider moving their daughter somewhere else to continue her musical education. His conviction follows that of this man, Michael Brewer, a former choirmaster in Manchester. He had sexually abused a violinist when she was 18. She took her own life during the trial. Campaigners say these cases show why our public inquiry into music institutions is needed urgently. This is not an issue about the welfare of their students according to them. Beginners hold today said current staff where shops at this breach of trust and it took the welfare of their students face seriously. -- the welfare of their students face seriously. -- where shocked. The police hope that many more women will feel able to come forward. The mayor for Tower Hamlets - accused of electoral fraud - has told the High Court his political party has no bank account, formal written constitution or transparent process for selecting candidates. Lutfur Rahman was giving evidence to a special election court after four members of the public demanded a re-run of last May’s mayoral contest. Let’s cross to Marc Ashdown who has more details for us. Lutfur Rahman denies any wrongdoing in the elections last May but today the focus was on his party. It was created in 2013 by himself and a bunch of other councillors after he was thrown out of the Labour Party. He admitted they have no written constitution as far as he is aware. They have no bank accounts, no membership list. You cannot become a member. No disciplinary procedures and no formal selection process. The judge interjected a number of times during the evidence saying he had to have a constitution to form a political party. He asked how donations were made. The baddest said this party does not comply with the minimum requirements needed to set it up. Tower Hamlets were elected to run the council with a budget estimated to be £1 billion. More questions in court about his conduct during council meetings? That is correct but it appears he does not take any questions at council meetings. He explained he had mainly deputies who take questions for him. We heard about one meeting where he said it would be against his human rights to answer the question. be against his human rights to answerthe question. He answer the question. He was a lawyer for 20 years. He did say integrity was important to them and denies any wrongdoing, saying those bringing this charge were sawed losers. The baddest demanded to see all financial records by 9pm tonight. He said he had a concern they could be manufactured over the weekend. The judge said he would seek all of that on Monday morning. The court will reconvene on Monday morning. -- on Monday morning. The court will reconvene on Monday morning. -- that barrister demanded to see all the financial records. The chief constable of Essex Police has confirmed that a further 8 child abuse cases have been referred to the police watchdog, the IPCC. The force has already apologised to alleged victims after it found problems with 30 investigations involving 59 children. Next - does London need a new state of the art concert hall - where the world’s greatest musicians can perform? Well, plans were announced today to see whether there is a need. It comes after the conductor Sir Simon Rattle told the BBC that the capital’s concert halls are not up to international standards. Let’s join Sonja jessup who’s got more on this for us. When you look at somewhere as grand as the Royal Albert Hall, you might be forgiven for wondering what is wrong with existing venues in London. It has hosted fabulous concerts. The question of a new state-of-the-art venue was raised by Sir Simon Rattle. He told the BBC he was considering coming to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in the future but only if there was a venue which can match the talent of the musicians. The Chancellor has said he will fund a study into this venue. I think this is a great addition to what London has to offer. It is about creating a new national music centre and a state-of-the-art facility. Also about creating a digital programme and something which will benefit the whole country. Where would this leave other concert venues in London? That is not entirely clear. I was told any new venue would have to complement rather than compete with existing ones. Not everyone is sure how that would work. The managing director of the Bill and Monica Orchestra said there has been criticism for some in the past over 26 at the Royal Festival Hall and the Barbican. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He said with the money not be better spent on the musicians themselves rather than a new building. Ithink themselves rather than a new building. I think at a time when there are cuts nationally and locally in the arts subsidies, if there is money available for a new concert hall, it would be better spent on supporting the performance. It is not great concert halls which make the performance, it is the performers and I think the grand should begin to then -- performers and I think the grand should begin to then -- to them. If this idea is given the thumbs up, the City of London Corporation may start looking for a suitable site. Thank you. Still to come this Friday evening. And the success of London’s Film Industry ahead of the Oscars. Time for the sports news now with Sara Orchard - on a significant day for Tottenham fans? Thanks Riz, yes, Spurs might have had to settle for a draw in Europe last night, but they enjoyed victory in the High Court today. The club can now buy the last piece of land they need for their new 56,000 seater stadium after a judge threw out an appeal by a family business who will now be forced to leave the site. Chris Slegg has been in court today. European nights under the White Hart Lane lights, but Tottenham are seeking a grander stage. This is the new 56,000 seat stadium they can now build. To get the go-ahead they have had to force a family business out. Archway sheet metal works have been in business for 30 years and say they had their own plans to expand. The jewels of the family who run it came to the High Court claiming the compulsory purchase order was invalid. Tottenham said the club’s plan was financially viable and they do have a firm commitment to make it a reality. The joseph Wright overtaking on notjust Tottenham a reality. The joseph Wright overtaking on not just Tottenham at the Secretary of State and the London borough. They left here certainly thrashed. The judge said there was no legal fall in the compulsory purchase order which was confirmed last summer. The company have 31 days to consider an appeal. Tottenham said the hope must be that this High Court decision will now allow us to progress the regeneration of Tottenham. The ruling was also welcomed by fans. We’re optimistic that finally they were -- We’re optimistic that finally they were -- there will be progress for the stadium and wider regeneration which will bring in benefits to the community. Wembley and Milton Keynes are among the options considered for 2018, the seasons bursts claim they have no option to find a temporary stadium while the new stadium is built. Summer2018 stadium while the new stadium is built. Summer 2018 is this sinister will be ready, that is if there are no further delays. -- will be ready, that is if there are no further delays. -- is this soonest it will be ready. Staying with football news, after announcing last night that three men have been suspended from Stamford Bridge, today Chelsea have issued an apology to the black man who was racially abused by club supporters on the Paris Metro on Tuesday. The apology came from the managerjose Mourinho as he spoke to the press ahead of tomorrow’s home match with Burnley. The Blues boss also said that Chelsea are writing to ""Souleymane"" to invite him to a home game as a guest. ~ I felt ashamed when I knew what happened. But I repeat, Iam I felt ashamed when I knew what happened. But I repeat, I am a happened. But I repeat, Iam a proud Chelsea football club manager because I know what the club is. These people do not represent the club.

The news has emerged after a public Twitter-spat earlier this week. Somalia-born Farah, said Vernon suggested he did not deserve to win his European Championship title-because he was not European. Vernon has told the BBC this was a ""huge misrepresentation"". Onto the World Track Cycling Championships in Paris and you can tell by the facial expressions that Great Britain’s women’s team-pursuit riders aren’t used to silver medals. They were beaten by Australia who broke the world record by nearly three seconds in the final. It denied the British team that includes Cheshunt’s Laura Trott and Sutton’sjoanna Rowsell a fifth straight gold- a fifth straight gold - their first defeat in four years. The world track cycling championships continues tonight, with coverage on the red button and on the BBC Sport website. That’s all the sport- back to you Riz. It’s a name that evokes the horrors of the First World War- The Somme. But for one woman from Kent, it’s actually her name. It was given in honour of her father, who was killed at the Battle of the Somme just a few months before she was born. Tiny Somme, as she’s known, is now 97. She’s been speaking to Mark Sanders about her unusual name and what it means to her. In1917, a baby In 1917, a baby girl was born and given the name heavy with history. Now 97, she has carried it through her long life in honour of the father she never knew. Her birth certificate recorded her film name. Tiny was her mother’s nickname. It is a name that someone used to say to me, why have you got that? I said mY to me, why have you got that? I said my father was killed at the Battle of the Somme, that is why. I would not want my name, they said. Her appearance were Herbert and emigration. He was constricted -- appearance were Herbert and emigration. He was constricted -- he was conscripted in 1915. His daughter was born by months later. I am very proud of it, I always have been. Every time I use it, I have to mY been. Every time I use it, I have to my name. In 1923 when she was six years old, she was at the unveiling of the war memorial where her father’s name is subscribed. When I saw other girls with their father, thatis saw other girls with their father, that is when it used to hearts. Very much, it did. Herbert Gray’s name is recorded here but perhaps his true memorial is in the name of his daughter, the child he never saw no art. -- he never saw all up. -- grow up. London’s always been a popular backdrop for Hollywood movies. But the capital’s become increasingly attractive for its facilities and expertise too. And the films made here are making vast amounts of money - with Paddington the highest grossing family movie outside of Hollywood. Wendy Hurrell looks at the success of London’s film industry ahead of this weekend’s Oscars. It has taken over £140 million at the box office. Blockbusting amounts for Hollywood but Paddington was not made in Hollywood. Somewhere increasingly higher up the billing of movie-makers. London. The film industry here is booming. For 2000, Harry Potter films were shot for a decade. Borland has been at Pinewood for much longer. These have been two of the high schools in film series of all time. -- james Bond of the high schools in film series of all time. --james Bond has been at Pinewood. London has the talent, the creativity, the fiscal incentives and has this city. This incredibly beautiful, engaging and inclusive city. The UK creative industry tax relief looters Hollywood money into London. It benefits us as well. The film industry is said to be worth more than £1 billion to the economy of the capital and employs 70,000 people. Warner Brothers studio is responsible for up to 3000 jobs. We have been so busy of late, we are really at the top of that number. At studio like these, there is everything you need to film the movie under one roof. As for postproduction, our reputation is so good even Star Wars has come to town. The visual effects are coming straight from Saul. Most of the big players and visual effects have places in London. It is one of the reasons I came to London, to be on that stage. So this weekend while we watch the Oscars, it may well be Hollywood watching us as London gains more prestige for being a film hub. Let’s get a check on the weekend weather with Phil Avery. Hello. I was in a quandary yesterday about this rain. As it creeps away across the Channel, the skies are beginning to clear. Some clear skies, with temperatures falling away, but showers overnight as well. That will be a problem. First thing tomorrow there may be some ice and frost around on a untreated surfaces. It is the north-westerly breeze which is bringing this cold feel to the day. There is some sunshine in the early morning. Into the afternoon, one or two showers remain. Quite a noticeable north-westerly breeze. If you are on the Sunnyside of this sheet-- Street, it will not feel bad. Once the sun is down, it’ll end up being quite chilly night. Fewer showers and frost around. A chilly start to Sunday but bright. It will not last all day. If you have plans, Iwill stop the chart at three o’clock, you can see where we expect to see the rain. Not everyone gets it by then but once it gets in, you keep it. If you’re heading towards the northern part of Britain, there will be blizzards across high ground. On Monday, a brighter day but some of those winds begin to pick-up and late on in the D they could be disruptive. Bearthat in late on in the D they could be disruptive. Bear that in mind but not a bad weekend. Thank you very much. The main headlines.

From the beautiful to the absolutely terrifying. I am on the trail of a curious deed that revolutionised the food world. It was brought back from the West Indies by an obsessive collector three centuries ago, feast your eyes on the oldest known surviving specimen of the cocoa plant. This is the key ingredient for chocolate. It was on a research voyage to jamaica in 1687 when 27-year-old physician Hans Sloane encountered the plant being used by locals to prepare a drink. It was hot chocolate, but not as we know it. Mark Spencer, a curator at the museum, as we know it. Mark Spencer, a curatorat the museum, is curator at the museum, is in no doubt about the significance of the specimen. He was an enormous collector of fantastic objects, but plans were one of his real passions. We have 110,000 specimens in this collection, including this original pod that was collected by him.

Hot chocolate was being drunk this way in France and Spain, and there is one recipe that still exists to this day that some believe was actually devised by Hans Sloane himself. The main thing is you have got a really full fat creaminess and a lot more sugar. This is an 18th century version of the kind of chocolate that he would have been prescribing for his patients. It smells familiar. Oh, and it tastes familiar too, that is rich and deep and very chocolatey.

111,BBC1 London,20-feb-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Counter-terror police try to trace three missing schoolgirls from east London who are trying to reach Syria and Islamic State. Aged just 15 and 16, they left from Gatwick airport three days ago - police say they’re extremely vulnerable. All we know is that the three girls have travelled of their own volition, against the wishes of their parents, without telling their parents and they are in danger. The three all went to the same London school attended by a fourth girl who left for Syria in December. We’ll be asking how young girls are being persuaded to leave their lives here tojoin IS.

On BBC London: More tubes to run for 24 hours, but questions over whether the Government can deliver on its pledge. And jailed for 11 years, the teacher who raped two students at a world-famous London music school. Good evening. Police have appealed for information about three teenage girls from east London who they believe are trying to reach Syria to join the group that calls itself Islamic State. Shamima Begum, who’sjust 15, Kadiza Sultana, who’s 16, and an unnamed 15 year old friend flew to Turkey from Gatwick Airport on Tuesday, without leaving any messages for family or friends. The three were at the same school as another 15-year-old girl who travelled to Syria in December. Here’s our Home Affairs Correspondent Daniel Sandford. Filmed by CCTV cameras at Gatwick Airport as they left Britain on Tuesday morning, three teenage girls, all friends and all in the same year at school. Shamima Begum isjust 15, but could be on her way tojoin the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. With her, her 16-year-old friend Kadiza Sultana. Both are British Bangladeshis, both successful at school. As was the 3rd friend, also 15, whose family do not want to be identified. This afternoon, the head of the Scotland Yard Counterterrorism Command appealed for them to phone home, or for anybody that sees them to contact police in Turkey. We are very concerned they might go into Syria, where they could be connected with the terrorist group calling itself the Islamic State. We are aware, as many people are, of the treatment of girls and women currently in that part of Syria. The friends went to this school, the Bethnal Green Academy in east London, rated outstanding by Ofsted. It’s half term. The girls left their homes early on Tuesday morning, lying to their parents about their plans. At Gatwick, date boarded a Turkish airlines plane for Istanbul, the same route to Syria taken by a fourth friend from the same year, at the same school, in December. Tonight, one of the school governors found it hard to believe the girls were really trying to get to Syria. I thought first of all it was a joke. Saying that they are off to Syria. I still don’t believe that they are going anywhere other than a holiday, because of how they were dressed, how they looked and how they packed. Luckily for British police, Teddy has been plagued by savage weather and travel chaos. -- Turkey. Detectives are hoping that the schoolgirls have not yet made it to the Syrian border. This is the first time Scotland Yard has gone public with the names of teenage girls who have travelled to Syria. It is a sign of how concerned they are about their safety and how worried they are about the growing phenomenon ofjihadi brides. It is thought more than 50 British women and hundreds from other western European countries have already travelled tojoin European countries have already travelled to join Islamic State. Many are still of school age. Some are encouraged to go there by other women who have already made the journey. There are women at the forefront of trying to recruit young girls. There are also older he had a chilly -- jihadi men, girls. There are also older he had a chilly --jihadi men, encouraging young girls, befriending them, and behaving in similar ways to how child sexual exploiters and groomers behave. The families of the three girls are said to be desperate, still hoping that somebody will stop their daughters crossing the border into Syria and into the dangerous world of the Islamic State. Daniel Sandford is at Bethnal Green Academy in East London where the girls all came from. Daniel, how concerned are police that all the girls came from the same school? ~ I think everybody agrees it is astonishing that four girls from the same year have all made the decision to travel to Syria to join Islamic State. At this stage, the police have found no evidence that radicalisation took place here. This is a school with a very good reputation. It seems that the only link is that the girls met here and became good friends. There are some big questions around tonight. First, how was it that Turkish airlines and the staff at Gatwick Airport allowed these three girls, unaccompanied, to board a flight to Turkey without asking any questions? It is, after all, the known route to Syria. How is it after their best friend travels to Syria in December and after all of the conversations they had with the police, with their friends and family, that these girls were not dissuaded from going to a place where, at best, they could become the brides of eightjihadi fighter, at worst they could be bombed by British or Americanjets. After crisis talks throughout the afternoon, eurozone finance ministers have agreed in principle to extend Greece’s loan arrangements. Athens has been given a four month extension to its bailout, subject to a list of reforms being approved by its international creditors on Monday. Our Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt is in Brussels. Gavin. Well, there was a lot of tension around the table here and the negotiations were difficult. In the end, the ministers felt that the uncertainty was bad, notjust end, the ministers felt that the uncertainty was bad, not just for Greece, but for the eurozone. So, Greece will not run out of money in the next few weeks. It will stay in the eurozone. This was the 3rd time at the eurozone finance ministers sitting around a table. The tensions and strains were growing. The Greek finance minister said they had gone the extra ten miles to satisfy their creditors. But the German finance minister had rejected the Greek plan to extend the bailout. But enormous pressures were building to strike a deal, even if many of the details will be worked out in the weeks and months ahead. Tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding trust. As you know, trust leaves quicker than it comes. The Greeks had to make concessions. No rolling back of reforms, no unilateral actions that might impact on the budget. All debts to be honoured. The Greek government said they had turned a page. We stood upright, from the beginning of the negotiations to the very end. Especially when faced with immense pressure. We showed that we were committed to skilful negotiations, for the purpose of achieving a mutually beneficial agreement between us and our European partners. Concealed the new agreement, Greece will have to draw UP agreement, Greece will have to draw up a new list of reforms on Monday. They will have to be based on the existing agreement. Only then will the deal be finalised by eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday. It is clear that Europe and Greece are moving ahead very cautiously. The new radical left Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has won a financial lifeline and Greece stays in the eurozone. He will struggle to deliver on many campaign promises. There will be no new austerity measures, but existing measures will remain in place and the new government’s hands are tied over how much they can spend on social programmes. Weighing heavily on the Greek ministers was news from the Greek banks. In recent days there have been heavy withdrawals. There was concern that if they did not have a deal struck here, when the banks reopened on Tuesday, there could be difficulties in Athens and elsewhere. One word of caution tonight, struck by the German finance minister. He said new funds to Greece would only be paid out when they had concluded the existing commitments under the current bailout. An indication that there could still be bumps in the road ahead. The strategically important Ukrainian town of Debaltseve is now firmly in the hands of Russian-backed rebels. The key railway hub has endured seven months of shelling and, in the past week, intensive fighting - despite the ceasefire. Our World Affairs Correspondent Paul Adams has reached the town. His report contains images some viewers may find distressing. After nine months of this war, the landscape is littered with its twisted remains. Here on the road to Debaltseve, the Ukrainian army fought off the rebel advance for weeks. Three days ago, the checkpoint fell, the town soon followed. This was a ferocious assault. For all their abandoned hardware, the Ukrainian soldiers here were simply overwhelmed. The victors scavenge through the wreckage. Most are from eastern Ukraine, but there is at least one Russian here. The bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lie out in the cold, uncollected and ignored, three days after they died in this desolate place. There is unexploded ammunition everywhere. Out in the fields, mines to get rid of. We move on, into Debaltseve. It has not been flattened, but weeks of shelling have taken their toll. The rebels are everywhere, but the town is eerily quiet. This is the central street in Debaltseve. As you can see, it is practically deserted, but for a handful of civilians and quite a few soldiers This town This town hasn’t had gas, water or electricity since just after the New Year. Many people are still living in underground shelters, they are afraid to come out and we can still hear the sound of occasional artillery fire. This part of Debaltseve is a bit of a ghost town. TRANSLATION: I think you can see it on my face, we weren’tjust scared, we were in total shock. Imagine my child, she couldn’t speak after all of this. She’s scared of everything now. After weeks of living underground, Alexey has come back to check on his modest house. A shell exploded right outside. His neighbour says they are tired of replacing broken windows. TRANSLATION: Everything is ruined. The Ukrainian National Guard hit us with shells from over there. Who do you blame for all this destruction? Alexey is clear, it is all the fault of Ukraine’s President, Petro Poroshenko. On the road out of Debaltseve, some of the men who took it are leaving. Theirjob done. They are in confident mood, having won their prize, will their leaders agree to stop shooting? Or have they already set their sights on another target? The Chancellor George Osborne has said the Government is on track to meet its borrowing and deficit forecasts for the financial year. Official figures show that january recorded the highest monthly surplus since before the financial crisis, with income exceeding spending by £8.8 billion. So far, from April to january, the government’s spending deficit - the amount it’s over-spent its income by - has reached £7lI billion. Today’s surplus figure suggests the Chancellor will now meet his target of a £91.3 billion deficit for the whole financial year. But Labour said Mr Osborne had broken his promise to balance the books before the election. After a group of Chelsea fans prevented a black Parisian from boarding a train while singing racist chants, the club’s management has apologised. They said they will invite the man, known only as Souleymane S, to Stamford Bridge to see a match as their guest. Chelsea managerjose Mourinho said that he and the team were disappointed in the fans. We feel ashamed, but maybe we shouldn’t, because we are not... I’m a proud Chelsea football club manager, because I know what the club is and these people don’t represent the club. Children’s mental health services in England face ""complex and severe challenges"". That’s according to the draft report of a Government taskforce, seen by the BBC. It says there has been a reduction in funding and service provision, and an increase in waiting times. Our health editor Hugh Pym reports. Kat knows all about the struggles of being a teenager with mental health problems. At the age of 13, she was depressed and felt isolated. There was no one to turn to. But she found a solution online - others who were going through the same thing. From that, she developed a virtual community. Without a shadow of a doubt if I hadn’t got support online when I was 13 or so, I would never have actually reached out and told anyone in the real world and I’d never have made that first GP appointment and got a diagnosis. So really, I mean the support I’ve got online has not only changed but saved my life. Kat now develops websites and phone apps, offering advice and information on mental health services for young people. The draft task force report says this is an area which could be expanded in the NHS. It also notes that the proportion of mental health spending on children and young people has fallen, that there are significant and unacceptable gaps and variations in consistency and coherence, and that the government has set out its commitment that mental health services for people of all ages should have parity of esteem with physical health. The issue of young people’s mental health has risen rapidly up the political and media agenda in the last couple of years. Labour has said the draft report made embarrassing reading for ministers and there was a serious crisis in children’s mental health services. The Department of Health said the final report, when published, would give a real opportunity to modernise care. Adrian Strain is clear what is needed - more qualified staff. His son Martin took his own life after suffering depression, which could have taken root in his teenage years. In the last two years of Martin’s care, nobody actually saw him. Most of the interactions were done on the telephone. That’s how remote, how busy those services are, and how lacking in human relationships they are. The final report, which will stimulate more debate around this sensitive issue, is due in the next few weeks. It’s a night of films, frocks and gushing speeches - and this year’s Oscars on Sunday are sure to live up to expectations. But how much of the awards are based on actual performance? Our arts editor Will Gompertz has been looking at the lobbying behind the scenes, and sent this report from Los Angeles. The glitz and glamour of the film awards season is about to reach its climax. This is the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, to which on Sunday night film stars and movie moguls will arrive via this soon to be revealed red carpet, to find out to whom the 6000 plus Academy members have decided to award an Oscar. It will bring to an end months of campaigning by producers to make sure their film has had the best possible chance of winning. Obviously, they’re not allowed to bribe Academy members but some behind-the-scenes lobbying can sail pretty close to the wind. There’s screenings, there’s dinners, there’s informal get your friends together, but the Academy tries to control that as much as possible in this phase of the voting. OK, it tries, but it doesn’t always succeed, as this veteran Hollywood producer acknowledges. There is some wining and dining but they’ve actually stopped that - I wouldn’t say cold - but it’s less of it, it’s people who basically will screen a movie at their house. I saw one of the movies that way. If you reverse time the universe is getting smaller. So the campaigning tactics have got a little more subtle. Competing films should be viewed in impartial surroundings, which you could argue is a difficult thing to achieve if one of the stars is hanging about before the screening. That’s exactly what happened. I happened to like the movie and Eddie Redmayne wasn’t in the room when I saw it, but the fact is that I don’t know that I would have said anything different than what I said or felt. I’ve been called all sorts of things. I’m just a simple guy. The truth is the Oscars are all about marketing. Any gladhanding and sweet talking by producers promoting their wares is more than matched by international brands pushing theirs. I think the misperception about celebrities is that they are too rich and famous to care about being gifted and the reality is I think Oprah has taught us you are never too rich or famous to enjoy a gift, to enjoy receiving a gift, to enjoy giving a gift and this is the way celebrities shop. These are the unofficial £120,000 consolation goody bags that will be given to the stars who end up going home without a golden statue. You see, everyone’s a winner at the Oscars, proving there really is no business like show business. A renowned classical musician has been jailed for 11 years for the rape and sexual assault of students while teaching at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Philip Pickett, who’s 64, carried out the attacks in the 1970s and '80s in sound-proof practice rooms. David Cameron has told the Scottish Conservative Conference in Edinburgh that Britain could be left with the ""ultimate nightmare scenario"" of Labour and the SNP in power after May’s General Election, bringing together ""the people who would break up our country and the people who would bankrupt our country"". Drivers could be owed tens of millions of pounds because of what’s been described as ""illegal"" parking penalties. Research from the RAC Foundation suggests that thousands of drivers who’ve been given parking tickets on private land could be in line for compensation. What’s it like to live in a country run by a minority government? It’s one of several possible outcomes here if no party wins a majority after the elections in May. Our deputy political editor james Landale has been to Sweden, where the last elections produced a political deadlock, to see how they made it work. In Sweden they take their politics as seriously as their winter sports. But the political twists and turns of recent months here have left this country reeling on the edge of constitutional chaos, a chaos that some fear Britain could face if, like Sweden, no party gets an overall majority in the General Election. They had an election here before Christmas. The conservative-led coalition was defeated. In its place came a coalition of centre-left parties, including the Greens. But crucially this new government didn’t have a majority here in Parliament. It was a minority administration. The balance of power was held by a surging anti-immigration party that promptly blocked the new government’s budget and plunged Swedish politics into chaos. This party, called Sweden Democrats, bears an uncanny resemblance to Ukip, giving a voice just voters who feel worried about uncontrolled immigration and ignored by mainstream politics, a party that’s determined to use its new-found influence. We have the balance of power, so we actually can be the one who decides which side will win. Of course, that’s quite a big influence. The other parties somehow will have to see that this is the way it is. Parliament was deadlocked, new elections were called, then cancelled, the government’s budget delayed. The new Prime Minister told me it hadn’t been easy. It was of course a very tough period, with uncertainty, yes, companies and households, everybody of course is wondering what is going to happen. It’s a very tough job, yes, but who said it was going to be easy? And it’s a tough job that potentially a British Prime Minister could face if there’s another hung parliament in May and no appetite for another formal coalition. It takes a lot of pragmatism of course, and willingness to compromise. At the same time, which is very important, you need to stand by your ideology, so you have to of course be able to look yours self in the mirror in the morning when you are shaving and say, I’m going in the right direction. These are turbulent times for Swedish politics. The parties used tojust rub along, but Sweden Democrats have changed all that. Experts say a culture of compromise has disappeared. We will get quite a shaky period in front of us but it might be possible for the government to survive, though they won’t deliver all these changes they promised to voters in the election campaign. On the streets of Stockholm there is some nervousness. Would you recommend minority governments to us in the UK? You could try it for a while but not too long, you should find a more solid solution. Sweden has a different electoral system and political culture to the UK, but the politics of minority government could be coming to Britain soon and all the uncertainty that follows in its wake. England suffered a humiliating eight-wicket thrashing by New Zealand in the World Cup. They were all out for a mere 123 runs, with the last seven wickets falling forjust 19 runs. And Kiwi bowler Tim Southee became only the fourth man ever in a World Cup match to take seven wickets. Natalie Pirks has more. When a day-night game finishes before the floodlights even flicker into life, you know it’s gone very badly for one side. Shambolic England were left well and truly in New Zealand’s shade. These first two games we said would be difficult games, playing against the two favourites in home conditions, but we shouldn’t be beaten by this amount. There’s no way. And yet they somehow found a way, losing Ian Bell and Moeen Ali to the wicked swing of Tim Southee. England’s openers, ended. The captain tried to calm things down but once he was gone you got a creeping sense of dread that cricket had been swapped for a playground game of skittles. COMMENTATOR: For Southee. Oh, goodness me. joe Root at least appeared to be trying, showing a little craft amid the crisis to reach A6, before he too was gone. COMMENTATOR: I don’t think it’s going far Fans are becoming used to that look of exasperation, joe, abject England all out for 123. If that was the trough, New Zealand wasted no time in hitting their peak. Brendon McCullum rubbing salt in the wounds, with an 18-ball half-century, the fastest in World Cup history. McCullum came out and absolutely slaughtered our bowling. He smashed it all over the park and really he made a bad day into one of the worst cricket days England have ever had in one-day cricket. Whilst the quality of the opposition so far has not come as a surprise, the wretched capitulation today has. With minnows to come the onus is now on England to start showing what they can do. And before we go - bitterly cold temperatures have continued for a second day in the eastern half of the US. But red pandas at a zoo in Cincinnati have been making the most of the cold snap. Zookeepers taking care of these two filmed them playing in the snow. The endangered red pandas are native to bamboo forests in China, and the foothills of the Himalayas. That’s all from us. Don’t forget a first look at the papers over on the BBC News channel. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Carter good evening. 24 hour services on the tube are to be expanded to other lines, the London Overground and the DLR - all by 2021. The Mayor and Chancellorjoined forces today to make the announcement, as part of wider plans to boost investment in the capital. But opponents have described it as a pre-election stunt. Here’s our Political Editor Tim Donovan. A meeting after midnight underground. The Chancellor and Mayor of London seeing some of the engineering work being done on the Victoria line. They had a go with the track laying machine which was laying the ground for news on 24 hour tube services. It is already meant to happen from September on the Northern, jubilee and Victoria line. It will also happen on these lines... It will not come into operation until 2021 which leads some to question the credibility of this pledge. Boris is making a commitment for 2021. He will no longer be Mayor of London. It sounds absolutely fantastic but can the mayor deliver? The announcement says 2021 which is well after Boris johnson and the Chancellor will have left office. It is pledged later trains will also run on overground services from 2017 but no agreement yet with staff. More significant than the promise of later running trains were the positive signals from the Chancellor on transport investment generally. He appeared to guarantee capital spending of £10 million over the ",,

It’s exceptionally good for your first time. Unemployment falls by 97,000 to 1.86 million - its lowest figure for six years. Pay growth outstripped inflation - with average earnings up more than 2%.

The strongest material known to man - how the teeth of the humble limpit could change the future design of Formula One cars. Later on BBC London. A stark warning why manufacturing and industry could disappear from the capital within our lifetime. Plus, sunshine and cloud on the way - a full weather forecast coming up. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News at One. Unemployment is down again - the number of people out of work in the UK fell by 97,000 to 1.86 million in the three months to December. It’s now at its lowest rate for six years. And there was further encouraging news on the economy with official figures showing that average earnings are up by 2.1%. After yesterday’s record low inflation rate the Government says that will help to ease pressure on working families. This report from our Personal Finance Correspondent Simon Gompertz. More jobs and that is helping spark a jump in pay. Including at this steel business in King ‘s Lynn, one of the leading areas. Stewart had a 5% pay rise last year and is expecting the same again. And he is working overtime on top. We put up a deposit for a house and have a new car. Ourway deposit for a house and have a new car. Our way of living is better. In the three months to December unemployment was down another 97,000. Wages were up, 2.1% on average, including year-end bonuses. Prices have been rising much more slowly byjust half a percent in December, so this is the biggest rise in the buying power of wages since the recession began. This is for combine harvesters. Here there were six staff four years ago, now 36. And they want to keep them. We try to look after the skilled employees. We are aware that they could move on so we try to look after them. With as growing, we look at the financial figures and we have been able to give them a pay increase and hope to carry that on. King ‘s Lynn is one of the spots where pay has been rising fastest. Like many places where wages started lower, they have been catching up quickly. But there are still many people who feel worse off than they were before the recession. If you are highly skilled you are in demand but a high proportion of the workforce here is earning atjust above the national minimum wage of £6 50 an hour. I’m on quite a low income. My husband works nights and has not tied a pay rise for 24 years or something like that. So it is slow, if it is increasing, it is slow. Every time a job goes up 100 people applied so it is hard to get a job. people applied so it is hard to get ajob. I struggle people applied so it is hard to get a job. I struggle to live on what I earn. I cannot claim benefits so I have delivered on what I earn. But the lift from this economic resurgence is spreading. More hands needed, and pay being pushed out. Our political correspondent Ross Hawkins is in Westminster. Good news on unemployment and for the government, good timing. Absolutely. When the figures are poor at they’re like a trip of Chinese water torture. For whoever is in government. When they’re good they are a reminder that there is good news to be had. But David Cameron does not want you to think it is fixed, he wants you to realise their is still a risk to the economy and he needs to be in Downing Street to sort it out. But Labour said it may be the case now but if you look at all those months since the banking crash, there is still a huge 969 banking crash, there is still a huge gap between earning power back then and now. It might have got a bit better they say, but it is still pretty poor. And this will come down to what people feel in their hearts, in effect in their wallet. Neither party can be certain of that and that sentiment about the economy and about the economic recovery could well decide the outcome of the general election. Prosecutors in Switzerland are searching the premises of HSBC’s private bank in Geneva. They say the investigation was prompted by leaked documents indicating that the bank helped wealthy clients evade taxes. Here, the former chief political commentator at the Daily Telegraph, Peter Oborne, has resigned after claiming that prominence was not given to the HSBC story because of commercial interests at the paper. With me now is our media correspondent David Sillito. A significant resignation. How significant? Look at the response from journalists, use executive last night when that statement first came out. Eye-popping, devastating, extraordinary. out. Eye-popping, devastating, extraordinary. He was the chief political commentator. Notjust another journalist political commentator. Notjust anotherjournalist going. The claims that he was making, the language, sinister shadowy figures, essentially skewing the news that the Telegraph prints for commercial reasons. He was saying it was not just about HSBC coverage, which is said you would need a microscope to obscene, but other companies as well. Tesco, even coverage of China he said was affected by these commercial interests. The response from the Telegraph, they said astonishing, unfounded innuendo. They deny it all. We tried to speak today to HSBC and no comment from them. Other has been a statement this morning from the Guardian newspaper, saying one of the organisations along with the BBC that broke these stories about HSBC in Switzerland, and they said during the course of their editorial discussions between theirjournalist and HSBC lawyers, HSBC decided to put its commercial relationship with the Guardian newspaper on pause. A decision which to tour the best of our knowledge, still stands. So giving some idea of the relationship between the Guardian newspaper and HSBC at the moment. Millions of customers of the big energy firms are paying too much by not switching suppliers. That’s according to competition regulators which found that people could save more than £200 a year on dual fuel bills by switching. Our industry correspondent john Moylan reports. The power to switch in tree supplier is in your hands. -- The power to switch in tree supplier is in your hands. -- energy supplier. It is a problem that has dogged the energy industry for years. Millions of customers have never switched supplier despite the big savings that can be made. Keith from Grantham has been with British Gas for 13 years. Despite seeing bills rise he is still not convinced that switching is worth it. Ido not see you will get any benefit, more than the first year you are with them. Because they put their prices up. Everyone wants to grab new customers. The competition authorities have been investigating the energy market for months. They found customers like Keith are paving found customers like Keith are paying too much. The report says between Ao and 50% of electricity customers have been with a supplier for more than ten years. 95% of dual fuel customers are missing out to the tune of up to £23lI per year. The report today is a damning indictment of the state of competition in the energy market. Demonstrating once again how it does not work for consumers. But the Spotlight must be on what changes the competition authority bring in to protect consumers paying over the odds. The report found fewer problems in areas like power generation. But Labour insisted it showed that the market was broken and the government said it would break up the big six if required. Others believe radical changes are needed to protect customers. These customers were essentially inherited from former monopoly nationalised energy companies so they have been honest Karas for a long time. Some people say you need to change the whole market structure to fix that. Some believe that could mean a return to regulated prices which would be the biggest shake-up in the industry in years. The electricity being generated here is enough to power 800,000 homes. But whether the industry is really delivering for consumers will not become clear until the initial findings of this probe are published later this year. Ukrainian troops are withdrawing from from the eastern Ukrainian town of De baltseve. The country’s President Petro Poroshenko says this is part of a 'planned and organised operation’. And that 80 percent of troops have now left. There’s been fierce fighting over the strategically important town - despite an agreed ceasefire. Our World affairs correspondent jonny Dymond has the latest. For the battered Ukrainian army, withdrawal. Forthe For the battered Ukrainian army, withdrawal. For the rebel opposition, the tree. Four weeks thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have been hunkered down in the town of Debaltseve, nearly encircled by pro-Russian rebel forces. Now they’re leaving and they’re happy to be getting out alive. We will apply all the time says one soldier, and said goodbye to our lives 100 times. -- we were praying. They had really good and heavy artillery. Debaltseve has been fought over because it is a strategic link between two rebel strongholds. As the ceasefire took effect, guns fell silent across most of the front line but the box above was too important to the rebels. The Ukrainian president Petra Pura Schenker about to fly east to greet his weary soldiers, said 80% of the units had pulled out. He said withdrawal had been planned and organised. And that his troops had left with their equipment. The rebels victory is also Russia’s. America urgently denounced Russian support for several tests. You could stop arming the separatists, stop sending hundreds of heavy weapons across the border in addition to your troops. across the border in addition to yourtroops. Stop your troops. Stop pretending you’re not doing what you are doing. And start calling on and insisting upon the separatists observing the ceasefire. With this withdrawal, the rebels and their Russian supporters have once again got what they wanted. But with Debaltseve in rebel hands it may be that the shaky ceasefire of the past few days will now hold. Our world affairs correspondent Paul Adams is on the outskirts of Debaltseve. What is happening on the ground? This is the road to Debaltseve. We are about 25 miles or so from the besieged town. All morning on this road which takes you out into Ukraine, we have seen a steady stream of vehicles and equipment, heavy guns, tanks and vehicles carrying very weary looking troops heading down this road. It is coming in dribs and drabs, sometimes long convoys, sometimesjust in dribs and drabs, sometimes long convoys, sometimes just a few isolated vehicles. But all the time the sense of a weary and defeated army heading away from a town that has become untenable. We spoke to a young soldier earlier. He said communications were down, ammunition running out. He and other units forced to take the decision to pull out. He and his colleagues have left, walked out overnight. He said that the assault on Debaltseve had begun after eight hours of the ceasefire last weekend. Eight hours of silence and then this very heavy assault which has forced the Ukrainian army to recognise the inevitable, that the town of Debaltseve is not sustainable and be needed to pull out before quite frankly a massacre might take place. We have seen a bit of outgoing fire, mortars and some rocket launchers in the fields on the other side of the road, they have been offering cover to those units who are coming back down the road. There is a sense of this protracted defeat. Footage has emerged which appears to show Chelsea football fans preventing a black man from boarding a metro train in Paris. A group of passengers can be heard singing a racist slogan. The incident took place before a Champions League match in the city against Paris St Germain. Chelsea says it will support any criminal action against fans accused of racist behaviour. Scotland Yard says it’s examining the video. Our sports correspondent Natalie Pirks reports. Chelsea! A pre-match scene in Paris is about to turn ugly. On a crowded Metro in rush-hour, a black man tries to board the train packed with Chelsea fans. Twice, he is forced off the train. Unashamed, the chants from some of them leaves passengers in no doubt as to why they did it. The man who caught it all on camera told the BBC it felt like a threatening environment. Before we heard the racist chants, they were shouting a lot of other stuff. There was some mention of World War II, and other things that I couldn’t quite work out. It seemed very aggressive. Chelsea had battled hard last night for a draw against Paris St Germain. Six of the squad who travelled were black. The make-up of their squad, though, seemed not to matter to the vocal minority last night. It is bad enough when it is on our own soil, when they do go abroad, they are shaming the name of the British public, and that is something that we have to stamp on very quickly. Here at Stamford Bridge, the club has reacted with a strongly-worded statement, describing the behaviour of some of those fans as abhorrent, with no place in football or society. They add that if evidence shows these men to be season-ticket holders or members here at Chelsea, they will take the strongest possible action against them, including banning orders. No to racism. Uefa has done a lot of work in this field, but today it said it can’t take action because the incident occurred away from the stadium. Fifa has condemned the behaviour, and the Metropolitan Police confirmed they will be assisting the French authorities to review the footage. This video is trending on social media, where some fans are beginning to name those allegedly involved. A timely reminder in 2015 that the battle against racism in football is far from over.

The sun could become the world’s biggest source of electricity by the middle of this century - a bold prediction from the respected International Energy Association in Paris. Their report offers hope to the half a billion people across Africa who are without electricity. The continent is desperately searching for energy, and giant solar farms are being built. Ed Thomas travelled to east Africa to find out if solar power can be the salvation many are looking for. It is something many take for granted, the power to light our homes, to watch TV, to read and write, but all of this is only possible because of the sun. This family live deep in Kenya’s Rift Valley. 200 kilometres from electricity, the solar energy charging these batteries has changed the way they live. It changes my life. My children are doing their homework, the TV, having it at home. The light is there always at home. For rural families like them, the sun is their only option. Some say Africa is on the edge of the solar revolution, standing here that seems like a distant ambition. But this vast continent has a big advantage when you consider the potential of one of its greatest resources. By 2050, analysts believe the sun could be the world’s largest SOUFCE of poWâI’. In sub-Saharan Africa, more than half a billion are still without electricity and need a solution. There are some exciting things going on, definitely some exciting markets developing for things like solar portable chargers. But the idea of a revolution is at the moment a bit too strong.

Greece has signalled it wants to ask for a bridging loan to win time to negotiate a new deal on its international financial bailout. Greece’s creditors want the new left-wing government to sign up to an extension of its existing bailout agreement by Friday - and to honour existing agreements. Our correspondent Mark Lowen is in Athens. What it that the Greeks want, and will be eurozone by? Well, the Greek government has said that tomorrow it will submit a formal written request for an extension of its loan agreement, but not an extension of its bailout programme. The difference between them is that the bailout programme contains all those painful conditions of posterity that the government wants to reject. So what it is saying is, continue funding us and we will discuss the conditions for that loan in the next four months. It is unlikely to fly because German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, has said that the money depends on the bailout. There is a lot of pressure on the Greek government to fall in line, and that pressure is coming from the European Central Bank, which is discussing whether or not to extend emergency liquidity funding to Greek banks. The suggestion is it will not extent that funding. That would be an attempt to push our fence towards a bailout deal, but it could also see a squeeze on Greek banks which are seeing a withdrawal of about 2 billion euros a week at the moment in cash. There is no bank run, no panic, but if withdrawals continue, capital controls could be imposed in the next few days in order to try to restrict the money taken out. All this attempt to put Russia on Greece, and time is ticking. It has been given until Friday to deliver a verdict to the eurozone. Will it accept the bailout? That decision will have huge applications not only for the future of Greece but for the future of the European single currency. Mark Lohan, thank you very much. There’s been a slight improvement in waiting times at Accident & Emergency units in Wales. 82.3% of patients were seen within four hours injanuary, up from 81% in December, but still well below the 95% target. The figure is also behind those recorded in England and Scotland, but higher than Northern Ireland. Our Wales Correspondent Hywel Griffith has more. The call came through as a cardiac arrest. When we arrived on the scene, he had a stab wound on the left-hand side of the chest. A front line more stressful than a war zone. That’s one Welsh nurse’s description of the conditions staff have been facing in A&E. Today’s figures show eight out of ten patients are seen within four hours, but a record number have had to wait over 12 hours. The Royal College of Nursing warns its members have been in the firing line. And the wait for patients has become unbearable. If you are going into hospital and you’re having to wait four, six, eight hours before seeing a doctor, sometimes your nerves can become frayed, you can react and respond differently to the way that you sometimes would, if this is unfortunately sometimes what is happening with the public. Pressure has been felt across the NHS this winter, but waiting times at major A&E units in Wales have been worse than in England and Scotland, and ahead of Northern Ireland. So why is that? Well, on average, the population of Wales is older and more likely to suffer from multiple chronic illnesses. But critics also point towards spending decisions made by the Labour-run Welsh government in the last five years, with an overall cut to the NHS budget. Come to the unit and we will replace your broken plaster. One solution is to encourage patients to choose the right part of the NHS. At this minor injury unit, 99% of patients are seen within four hours, while there are longer waits at the major hospitals. Nightmare. You are there hours and hours and hours. If you have little ones it is difficult, because you’re trying to keep them entertained while you’re waiting, and other people are not feeling very well. The Welsh government has promised more money to deal with winter pressures. But how well the NHS he copes is under greater scrutiny than ever. Hywel Griffith, BBC News. Patients and visitors will be banned from using electronic cigarettes in all hospital grounds across Scotland bar one within weeks. NHS boards will be required to ensure that their grounds are smoke-free by April. Our scotland correspondent Laura Bicker is in Airdree. What other hospitals saying is the reason behind this? We contacted hospitals, and all but one of them told us that they would and use of these e-cigarettes, and they say it is because they contain nicotine, and they will treat them like other nicotine products. They say there are concerns over their safety and they haven’t had enough research done into them as cigarettes. The smoking group Ash do not agree, they say that these help people give up smoking, and I alsojoined by the pro-smoking group, Forest. But these will soon be banned in Scotland’s hospitals. Laura Becker, thank you very much. Now, it used to be thought that spider silk was the strongest biological material known to man. But now researchers say this accolade actually belongs to the teeth of the limpet. The findings, published by the Royal Society, could help human engineers build their own stronger, lighter materials, and even change the way we design things like Formula 1 cars. Live now to Duncan Kennedy, who’s on the Dorset coast for us. Duncan. Thank you, Simon. Here is the humble limpet. Not dynamic, not even that pretty. But what stars they are. The teeth of these things really know could be the strongest biological material in the natural world. From beaches to boats, from rocks to rock pools. Meet the world beating limpet. Hidden under that distinctive greeny brown shell like the teeth of a creature that has stunned marine scientist. Looking at the molecular structure of the teeth, they have discovered an incredibly strong material called gauthite, which they now believe is on the list of the world’s toughest cereals. They are the real winners of the strength competition. It is still about 10% stronger than the best spider silk. Spider silk had been short of -- best spider silk. Spider silk had been short of -- thought of as the titanium of the natural world. But none of this surprises naturalists, who say it is time the limpet hit the limelight. We are delighted. We always knew that they were really special animals. always knew that they were really specialanimals. For special animals. For example, they always special animals. For example, they always come back to the same spot on the rock, their home, when they have been feeding, so they are under estimated animals, and we love this news. In these speeded up pictures, you can see the powerful grasping movement of limpets on rocks. They live to about 17 years old. It is now thought that the fibrous structure of their teeth would be copied everywhere from aviation to marine engineering. The limpet, whose teeth are gripping the scientific world. Who would have thought that the teeth of this creature would be so impressive? We have been asked by environmentalists to tell people not to try to prise them off, because that affects the ecosystem in places like this. They say come along and enjoy this highly underestimated creature in its natural habitat. Duncan Kennedy, thank you very much. You’re watching the BBC News at One.

But first with all the day’s sport, here’s jessica Crighton at the BBC Sports Centre. Afghanistan have made their debut at the Cricket World Cup.

Darren Clarke has been named as Europe’s Ryder Cup captain for next year’s tournament in Minnesota. The Northern Irishman was chosen by a five-man selection panel which included last year’s victorious captain Paul McGinley. Clarke has played in five Ryder Cups and he’s been a vice-captain twice. His task will be to lead Europe to a fourth successive triumph over the United States. Ireland’sjamie Heaslip has accepted an apology from France’s Pascal Pape for the injury that threatens to end his Six Nations. Heaslip has three fractured vertebrae and will be out for the next month, after he was kneed in the back by Pape during Ireland’s victory in Dublin on Saturday. The Frenchman faces a disciplinary hearing today and could be banned for the rest of the tournament. He tweeted to say he was ""sincerely sorry"" and it wasn’t his intention to injure Heaslip. Great Britain’s jenny Meadows hopes the days of losing out to drugs cheats are behind her. Meadows is in the form of her life heading into the European Indoor Championships in Prague next month, having run the two quickest indoor 800 metres times in the world since 2012. Meadows is optimistic that she’ll be competing in a clean field, but she knows the widespread Russian doping allegations will be on everyone’s minds. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. Only are Prince Charles has been visiting a new sewer which lies under Stratford in east London. It is hoped it will improve the struggling subterranean way system. A powerful storm has dumped snow across a lot of America. Forecasters say there’s more to come this weekend. Niagara Falls as you probably have never seen them before. In Philadelphia firefighters tackling a blaze founder hydrants to be frozen. The record-breaking big freeze has put lives in danger. In Newjersey three teenagers became stranded on ice. One fell in. Rescuers taking risks to drag them all back to safety. In name to 15-year-old boys went missing after riding their snowmobiles to see their grandfather. They were found safe the next day. The powerful storm swept through states across much of the American South and North East. In Boston it is the slowest month in more than a century. So far this year the city has had almost 2.5 metres of snow. In Washington the White House lived up to its name. For some it was an excuse to have fun. For others with places to go, they had to find alternative means of transport. It is notjust the snow at the high winds that have caused problems. Hundreds of thousands of people have been left without power. There is little sign of the cold weather abating. Forecasters are warning that another arctic blast will hit this weekend. And Nina Ridge is here with the weather forecast. That storm is not heading our way but there is plenty of rain. We started with clear skies this morning. A bit of a frost once again. Warmer to the north west of Scotland at 8 degrees. But by the afternoon the temperatures will have evened out. Temperatures getting into double figures. But the warmth across the North Aberdeenshire coast line, we could get close to around 15 degrees. That is because of the direction of the wind coming up from the South West. That is warming up the air. Plenty of cloud around, and some rain as well. Overcast through Wales and the South West of England but not a huge amount of rain. And we keep those clear skies with some sunshine in parts of the East Anglia. Some patchy rain in the north-west of England and the odd spot for Northern Ireland where it is mild but again overcast. The main focus of the wet weather in the north-west corner of Scotland where we also have that gusty wind. The main area of rain will clear through Scotland and Northern Ireland heading into England and Wales and behind that system we have some breaks in the cloud and some showers moving into the north west. Temperatures are around four, 7 degrees. The area of rain slows down as it heads across England and Wales, potentially not reaching the South East corner until later in the afternoon. Behind that the air is much colder. Some showers could be wintry across the higher ground and it is a cold day. For the end of the week we see that weather front clearing East. We have been watching the development of this low system for Friday. It looks now certain to bring the spell of wet and windy weather across England and Wales, we are still tying down the details. Further north, still with that colder air with some sunshine and a few showers scattered around. The start of the weekend sees the cold air sitting across the UK but there will at least be some sunshine with a few showers mixed in. Temperatures were by Sunday because we are dragging in war cloud. Back to and windy weather to finish off the weekend. -- windy weather to finish off the weekend. -- more cloud. A lot more cloud further north and west. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Unemployment falls by 97,000 to 1.86 million - its lowest figure for six years. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Alex Bushill. Industrial businesses could disappear from the capital within the next 50 years. That’s the warning from the Green Party on the London Assembly who say industrial sites are being lost to redevelopment - many of them new housing. They’re calling on the Mayor to support the capital’s manufacturing businesses, as Karl Mercer reports. Tucked away in Hackney Wick is a famous brewing name reborn in the East End. A couple of hundred yards from the Olympic Stadium, Truman’s is pumping out 70,000 pints of beer a week. But this is a business that could be on the move to make way for housing. It has always been an industrial area, has been for hundreds of years, and it is now rapidly becoming a housing development. It has already started nibbling at the edges. As we go block by block, it is all disappearing, and we have been informed that our block will also be developed for housing in the next five years. Next door, this kitchen workshop faces a similar fate. It has already had to move four times, getting further and further from central London every time it moves. The question is, once you get a certain distance out, do you then try to move right out of London to get the cheaper space? And there isn’t a lot, because I have looked several times. There isn’t a lot available. So these kind of industrial parks are good for us, and exactly this kind of space. But I believe in this area in Fish Island, they are building hundreds and hundreds of new flats, and there is no more industrial space. It is an issue highlighted today by the London Assembly. Yes, they say, London needs more homes. But not at the expense of industrial units like these. Obviously we have a housing crisis in London, and I’m really supportive of building more houses, but we need the jobs as well. And it is just mad to push out viable businesses just to build housing when it means losing skilled manual jobs, it means more lorry movement on our roads, it potentially means higher prices, of course, if you push the businesses far enough out. City Hall said the mayor’s infrastructure plan would balance the need for London’s growing population both in terms of where it lives and where it works. Karl Mercer, BBC London News. A right-leaning think tank has said that the Labour Party’s plans for a mansion tax are out-dated and unnecessary. The party wants to introduce a tax on homes worth more than 2 million pounds in order to increase funding for the NHS. But the Centre for Policy Studies says the tax burden on high value homes has already risen significantly due to changes in stamp duty. Labour said it was right to ask the rich to make a bigger contribution. A hearing to determine the future of a new stadium for Tottenham Hotspur has resumed today. The club plans to build a new 56,000 seater stadium on its existing ground. But a local business - Archway Sheet Metal works - claims it’s being unlawfully forced to move, and has taken its appeal to the high court. A decision is expected on Friday. Labour’s much criticised pink election bus has arrived in Croydon this morning. The deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman was onboard, as part of a campaign to encourage women to vote. Critics have called the minibus a ‘Barbie bus’. But Labour say the choice of colour is not patronising. Now the weather with Alina jenkins. Another fine day with plenty of sunshine on offer. We are starting to see a bit more cloud creeping in. But a bright afternoon, just a little more cloud around than this morning. A gentle south-westerly wind, perfectly pleasant out and about with temperatures already up to eight or nine degrees.

The number of unemployed people in Britain has fallen again, and is now at its lowest rate for six years. In the last quarter it went down by 97,000. It now stands at 1.86 million - that’s 500,000 down on a year ago. Official figures out today also showed that average earnings, including bonuses, are up by 2.1%. The Government says the news, following yesterday’s record low inflation rate, it will help to ease pressure on working families - but Labour says millions are still struggling to make ends meet. Our Personal Finance Correspondent Simon Gompertz has more. One rise leads to another. The uplift injobs carries on, helping to spark a jump in pay, including at this steel business in King’s Lynn in Norfolk, one of the areas leading the wage recovery. Stewart had a 5% rise last year. He’s expecting the same again and he is working overtime on top. We’ve put a deposit in for a house, we’ve got a mortgage, WE have DEW CATS. Our way of living is better. This is combine harvesters, where different attachments go on. There were six staff in the business four years ago. Now there are 36 and they want to keep them. We’re trying to look after our skilled employees. We are quite aware they could move on or get poached. So we do try to look after them. With us growing, we look at our financial figures and it’s allowed us to give them a pay increase each year. King’s Lynn is one of the places where pay has been rising fastest. But it’s from a low base. There are still plenty of people who feel worse off than they were before the recession. The right skills might get you a hefty rise, but many here are stuck on low pay. I’m on quite a low income. My husband himself works nights, and he hasn’t had a pay rise for three orfour years, something like that. If it is increasing, it would be very slowly increased. I’m in the care industry, but I find we do a lot of hard work, although our boss tries to give us a good wage increase, we are still on minimum wage. Which I don’t think is good enough for what care work we do. The minimum wage has increased. But at this floorboard maker nearby, it’s the only pressure pushing up wages. There’s no great pay rises around at the moment. When we look to recruit more people or replace people, we have no trouble in finding applicants. We have 30 or 1+0 applicants perjob. So, how much gets sliced off your pay increase depends on the job. But now that price rises are so low, any extra money goes a lot further. Simon Gompertz, BBC News, in King’s Lynn. Let’s go now to our Political Correspondent Ross Hawkins who’s at Westminster for us. Good economic news, but what is the political impact? Well, it is significant stuff. Wage growth has now outstripped inflation forfour growth has now outstripped inflation for four consecutive months. That’s the first time that has happened since the banking crisis of 2008. The Conservative message in Downing Street is not that the job is done, but that there is a risk coming the Prime Minister’s words, that it could go to pot if there was a Labour Chancellor behind the door of number 11 after the election. As far as Labour are concerned, they think the Conservatives are much too gleeful. They think there is a risk they are telling us we have never had it so good, and they would put low inflation down to the good luck of the oil price, rather than any Chancellor’s judgement. of the oil price, rather than any Chancellor’sjudgement. On both Chancellor’s judgement. On both sides, Chancellor’sjudgement. On both sides, they know it is not a debate that will be resolved by facts and figures, it will be sorted by what voters feel in their hearts and their wallets, and who they trust in the economy. That is a debate that could swing a general election. Many thanks. Scotland Yard says it will help to identify Chelsea football fans shown in an amateur video apparently preventing a black man from boarding a Paris train. The footage shows the man being repeatedly pushed from the carriage doors, and the fans chanting approvingly about racism. The incident took place before a Champions League match in the city. Chelsea FC said it would help police and that any fans involved faced a ban. Natalie Pirks reports. A pre-match scene in Paris is about to turn ugly. On the crowded Metro in rush hour, a black man tries to board a train packed with Chelsea fans. He is forcibly pushed off, twice. Unashamed, the chant from some of them leaves passengers in no doubt why they did it. Yet a Chelsea fan who was on the train claims the chanting was actually about their captain. I heard something along the lines ofjohn Terry, he’s a racist and we love it, or something like that. You are saying the pushing and chanting weren’t connected? No, of course they weren’t connected. The press are trying to make something out of nothing, as usual. Chelsea had battled hard last night for a draw against Paris St Germain. Six of the squad who travelled are black. This video is a source of shame to fans returning home from the French capital. It’s not nice, it’s not what anybody wants to see in this day and age. Of course, it’s a very offensive. It’s very bad. Especially for our kids. I’ve got three kids and they support Chelsea as well. Here at Stamford Bridge, the club has described the behaviour of those fans as abhorrent and said they will take the strongest possible action, including banning orders, if any of them are shown to be season-ticket holders or members. The first black player to play for Chelsea believes the shocking footage isn’t representative of true fans. Once I saw the video, I was so angry. I was really astonished. I was amazed. Where did this come from? I don’t want people to think, oh, my God, it’s gone back to the days of the 80s, the days of when I used to play, because it’s not like that at all. I believe in that. No to racism. Uefa has done a lot of work in this field but today it said it can’t take action because the incident occurred away from the stadium. But The Met police can act. It has confirmed they will be assisting the French police to review the footage. Once identified, those involved could face up to three years in prison. Natalie Pirks, BBC News. In Ukraine, Government forces have pulled out of a strategic town in the east of the country, where troops were fighting against Russian-backed separatists. Ukraine’s President today called it a planned and organised withdrawal from Debaltseve following a fierce assault by rebels. There is supposed to be a ceasefire in region, after a deal agreed earlier this week. The town stands in the middle of buffer zones set up by the deal on both sides - from where heavy weaponry was meant to have been withdrawn. From eastern Ukraine, Paul Adams reports. In clouds of dust and diesel, a ragged column emerges from the scene of the Ukrainian government’s latest defeat. It’s worst in months, inflicted four days into an international mediated ceasefire. All morning they rumbled past on the road from the vaults, escaping of relentless shelling. -- did not ina bus in a bus by the side of the road, two exhausted comrades.

The battle for Debaltseve has not been a bloodbath, but at least 20 lives have been lost since the weekend, for nothing. It’s made afternoon, and the retreat from Debaltseve is still going on. Ukraine’s President says this was all planned, but that’s not how it seems on the ground. From here, it looks like a hasty retreat in the face of overwhelming odds. As the Ukrainian army leaves Debaltseve behind, the rebels are getting what they want. This could make a conference of ceasefire more likely. But nobody here is counting on it. -- comprehensive ceasefire. Some disabled children have been waiting more than two years for a diagnosis, according to a survey carried out by the British Academy of Childhood Disability. One paediatrician has told the BBC that she, along with many of her colleagues, sent referrals back to GPs - deliberately delaying a child’s care so that they could meet targets. Our Disability News Correspondent Nikki Fox has the story. And lift up again. Ruby’s doing her exercises. They’re essential because she has hypermobility, a joint condition that causes pain and weakness. But it took over a year for her to be diagnosed. Push again. In that time, she fell behind at school. Walking, writing or evenjust standing up was a struggle. But, more worryingly for her mum, she couldn’t help her because she didn’t know what was wrong. I just thought she just wasn’t trying hard enough. And it’s just really hard to know what’s related. Do you feel a bit let down? Really, yes, Ido. I feel like a bit more care should have been taken. Maybe if somebody could have helped we would have got here quicker and maybe avoided a lot of pain and upset. Would you be able to sit down on the floor... Paediatricians diagnose and support disabled children with a range of conditions. They play a vital part in getting the right therapy in place - something that’s crucial to helping the young person participate in everyday life. And this is how it’s supposed to work. From the moment a child is referred by their GP, they should, according to government guidelines, see a paediatrician within 18 weeks. But we’ve spoken to a whistle-blower who’s revealed that she, along with her fellow clinicians, are under pressure to reach targets. In this letter, she claimed she has been advised to instruct GPs to hold back on referrals in order to meet the 18 week target - resulting in children having to wait even longer for an assessment. A survey of leading paediatricians across the UK highlights how this manipulation of figures may have a knock-on effect, leaving some children waiting for a diagnosis for over two years. We hear every week about emergency department waiting times. We don’t hear every week about the length of time it takes to see a paediatrician with a specialist expertise. The Department of Health stressed that any minute manipulation of waiting times is unacceptable. It added that decisions on spending are made locally, but that it was working to reduce waiting times byjoining up health, education and social care. Thanks to ongoing treatment, Ruby’s strength and balance has improved immeasurably, and her family now know how best to support her as she grows up. Theyjust hope the delay in diagnosis doesn’t impact her future. Nikki Fox, BBC News. Our top story this evening: Good economic news. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in six years and earnings are up.

And Celtic get ready to take on their whole the European adversaries, inter-Milan. Many people stick with the energy firm they’ve always used for their gas and electricity. Today comes a warning that nearly all dual-fuel customers of the big firms would save money if they switched tariffs or suppliers. The Competition and Markets Authority, which is investigating the energy industry, said customers are missing out on possibly over £200 per year. Our correspondent Rory Cellan-jones reports. The power to switch energy supplier is in your hands. The government has now made it easier than ever to switch and save. It’s a problem that has dogged the energy industry for years, millions of customers have never switched supplier despite the big savings that can be made. Andy Heals did try to find a better deal online recently, he found out he could save hundreds of pounds by switching to a different tariff with his own supplier. I think they’re not doing enough to help their customers pick the right tariff for them, especially people who don’t have access to the Internet and can’t look at these deals themselves. They’re in a greatly disadvantaged position and are spending too much money on their power. The report says between Ao and 50% of electricity customers have been with the same supplier for more than 10 years. 95% of dual-fuel customers are missing out on savings of up to £23lI a year. Today’s report is a damning indictment of the state of competition in the energy market, demonstrating once again how it doesn’t work for consumers but the spotlight must now be on what remedies, what changes the competition authority bring in to protect consumers that are paying over the odds. They found fewer problems in areas like power generation but Labour insisted it showed the market was broken and the government said it would not flinch from breaking up the big six firms if that would help consumers. Some believe protecting customers could mean going back to much tighter regulation. I think it depends, if you want fairness, to make sure everyone has the same price, you may need to introduce some regulation of prices but that is very different from the model of competition which was set The industry insists it is already moving to make things clearer but with the initial findings of this inquiry expected later this year, the price we pay for energy will remain a cause of heated debate. A 16-year-old from Greater Manchester has been charged with terrorism offences. Police say the boy, who can’t be named for legal reasons, was attempting to acquire a biological toxin. But have stressed there is no intelligence or evidence to suggest that communities within the Mossley or Greater Manchester area are, or were, at risk in relation to this investigation. Police in Switzerland have searched the offices in Geneva of the Swiss private arm of HSBC, as part of a money laundering inquiry. Prosecutors said the investigation was prompted by the recent publication of leaked documents indicating the bank had helped wealthy clients evade taxes. HSBC said it was co-operating with the Swiss authorities. Last week, it apologised for what it called ""historical events"" and said procedures at its Swiss bank had been completely overhauled. Here, the journalist, Peter Oborne, has called for an independent review to be carried out of the Daily Telegraph’s editorial guidelines and whether the paper has put commercial interests first. Mr Oborne resigned as the Telegraph’s chief political commentator because he said the paper’s lack of coverage of the HSBC story amounted to a ""form of fraud on its readers"". The Telegraph has rejected his claims. Our media correspondent, David Sillitojoins me now. What does he want the review to look at? The response, eye-popping, devastating, explosive came from manyjournalists devastating, explosive came from many journalists and manyjournalists and executives when they saw what he wrote in his farewell words to the Daily Telegraph. He says their news coverage has been skewed by commercial interests. He mentioned a whole collection of companies but most importantly HSBC, he said the coverage of that recent story was microscopic and it has reported less that its main rivals. We spoke to former executives, senior journalists, and they echoed much of what he said. The newspaper says it is utterly unfounded and they say the barrier between adverts and news is fundamental. HSBC have made no comment but a final comment came from the Guardian, which Ist broke the story along with the BBC, and they say there commercial relationship with HSBC have been put on pause at the bank and continues to be on pause. Thank you. Waiting times at accident and emergency departments in Wales have improved slightly but are still below target. just over 82% of patients were seen within four hours last month, well below the 95% target. Performance in Wales is also lagging behind that of England. But figures haven’t yet been published for Scotland or Northern Ireland. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym has the details. I need no corridor waits... It’s a crucial meeting at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in South Wales, nursing staff and doctors monitoring how full the wards are as the patients keep on arriving at accident and emergency. There is not a lot of available bed space so what we have to do is manage our demand and capacity so that we know when our pinch points are and that is looked at in detail every day. Here, the system has led to improved performance. But elsewhere in Wales, accident and emergency units are still under immense pressure with waiting times falling well short of the government target. It’s just the waiting time, the staff are so overworked anyway, there’s just not enough staff. And too many patients. Especially in the evenings, people with alcohol problems and things like that, it’s not an environment I would like to be in. In the long-term, doctors say pressure on hospitals can be eased by better management of patients with chronic conditions. It looks like a hospital but this is a special facility for training medical students in community health care, getting the doctors of the future to understand better how to look after patients closer to home, so reducing emergency admissions to hospitals. Gary is a patient with type 1 diabetes who has volunteered so the students at this centre in Merthyr Tydfil can learn more about his condition. I have my good times and my bad times but hopefully, with voluntary work, maybe Io years down the line people aren’t suffering the same thing because they have already learned from it. The NHS in Wales has been criticised over accident and emergency performance lagging behind England and Scotland but figures today show waits for cancer treatment were better than in England. Right now it’s a highly charged political debate. Engineers in the UK have found the strongest biological material ever tested. Believe it or not, it’s the material that makes up the teeth of limpets. The marine creatures use a tongue bristling with teeth to scrape food off rocks. They found it was stronger than spider silk, as well as all but the very strongest of man-made materials. Duncan Kennedy is on Cambridge beach in Dorset. Even David Attenborough would be impressed by the humble limpet. I have 1 here, not much to look at, not cuddly but it is its teeth which have been the talking point. Now officially seen as the strongest while logical material in the natural world. while logical material in the naturalworld. -- biological natural world. - - biological material. Small, round and perfectly formed, but watch out for the teeth. The humble limpet hasjust been promoted to the Premier League of mighty molars. Microscopic shots of their teeth taken by the University of Portsmouth shows a material called goethite which is now thought to be the strongest biological substance in the natural world. Here is a limpet, sticking to the rock as you would expect. For conservationists, the research comes as no surprise, they have long hailed the limpet’s dental dazzlers. We always knew that limpets were really special animals. For example, they always come back to the same spot on the rock, their home scar, when they have been feeding. They are very underestimated animals and we just absolutely love this news. Until now it had been thought the silk of spiders webs was nature’s toughest biological material. But it now seems that limpet’s teeth are 10% stronger. Beachcombers we spoke to today were amazed by this secret life of limpets. I didn’t know limpets had teeth! Very strong ones! Yes! That explains why it’s so hard to get them off, boys. Spiderman will be gutted to know he can’t use his web and there is something stronger! Limpets live to about 17 and don’t make, as males become females. There seems no end to the qualities of this marine masterpiece whose teeth have now given us new pearls of wisdom. Let’s take a look at the weather now. There will be some strong tide and exclude aid and fluctuations in weather from place to place and date today. Still frozen across the North Eastern states, -151st thing this morning but some of us have had temperatures into the mid teens. 16 in the North East of Scotland. It is all change again this evening with wet weather across western Scotland and strong winds in north-eastern areas. This area spreads across Scotland and Northern Ireland with strong winds ahead of that in north-east inlet and North Wales. At quite start of the night but that wind will pick up as this front rings rain into north-western England and Wales. Blustery showers getting going 1st thing. 6 or 7 will be typical. But a different day, it will be chilly and blustery. Further south, a different day, no more clear blue skies and sunshine but instead a cloudy, damp afternoon across many central and southern parts of England and Wales. Not too bad in the far south-east until late on. Behind that, brighter skies but it will be chilly in the wind. There will be some snow over the mountains. All eyes to the south-west going into Thursday night and Friday morning. A lot of uncertainty about the extent of this rain coming from the West into central and southern England and Wales, there could be some snow. We will keep you posted. A lot going on, more details on the website. A reminder of the main story, and implement has fallen to a 6 year low and average earnings are up over 2% including bonuses. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me and on Tonight on BBC London News: The increasing number of attacks on Tube workers - it’s almost doubled in five years. We are very WE BFE VâI’y COI’1CâI’Iâ1âd, the amount of passengers that could be intoxicated on the chains. This will only get worse. And the businesses that say they are being forced out of the capital to make way for housing. And police moved in to evict squatters at the Aylesbury Estate. We will fight until we get the rights to stay here as council tenants. And why the Prince of Wales found himself deep underground in the East End. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. Tube workers are facing increasing abuse from angry passengers, according to new figures. The number of assaults, which include verbal and physical, on Underground staff has risen 44% in the last five years. London Underground say the reporting of abuse has increased, and the figures reflect more verbal abuse than physical, but unions say many staff feel at ""constant risk of attack"". Tarah Welsh reports. A man has his foot stuck in a door and he seems frustrated. A member of this stuff is pushed and a man shouts and swears. This footage is filmed by a passer-by and it seems these incidents are a passer-by and it seems these incidents in the morning he knew that there was a1 in four chance to you would be abused at work that day. That is what London Underground staff face and there are seven attacks everything all day. Last year to 2753. Verbal assaults made our path. 35% were threats of violence and 16% were actually physical attacks. And when we went underground today, the first employee we spoke to off-camera told us he had been abused and spat out. This is called VD NA collection pit. Infact abused and spat out.

A warning tonight that traditional manufacturing jobs in the capital are set to disappear all together in the next 50 years. With land prices at a premium in the capital, industrial sites are being lost to redevelopment - many of them to new housing. The Green Party, on the London Assembly, say the Mayor’s focus on providing 42,000 new homes a year over the next 20 years is disregarding the need to support the capital’s businesses. Our Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, reports. Tucked away in Hackney Wick is a famous brewer name, reborn in the East End. A couple of hundred yards from the Olympic Stadium, Trumans is pumping out 70,000 pints of beer a week. But this is a business that could be on the move, to make way for housing. These are fermentation vessels, so the beer will stay in here for a week or sometimes more than a week. It’s always been an industrial area, has been for hundreds of years, and it’s now rapidly becoming a housing development. It’s already started nibbling at the edges, and as we go block by block, it is all disappearing. We have been informed, in the last year, that our block will also be developed into housing within the next five years. Next door, this kitchen workshop faces a similar fate. It has already had to move four times, getting further and further from central London every time it moves. The question is, once you get a certain distance out, do you then try and move right out of London to get cheaper space? There isn’t a lot, because I have looked several times. There isn’t a lot available. These kind of industrial parks are good for us, exactly this kind of space. I believe in this area, in Fish Island, they are building hundreds and hundreds of new flats. There’s no more industrial space. It’s an issue highlighted today by Greens on the London Assembly. Yes, they say, London needs more homes, but not at the expense of industrial units like these. Obviously we have a housing crisis in London, and I am really supportive of building more houses. But we need the jobs as well. It isjust mad to push out viable businessesjust to build housing, when it means losing skilled, manualjobs. It means more lorry movements on our roads. It potentially means higher prices, if you push the businesses far enough out. They are absolutely right. We have to be careful, but they are being very careful, we are notjust letting go any of the core industrial land. There is a lot of industrial land, which is very likely used at the moment, with relatively little employment on it. Particularly that which is near transport notes is ideal for housing. City Hall said the mayor’s infrastructure plan will balance the need for London’s growing population, both in terms of where it lives, and where it works. Ajury has been hearing details of how a woman, charged with the honeytrap murder of a professional poker player, changed her name as she targeted the 56-year-old for his cash. The court heard phone records suggested the father of three was happy to pay for everything, and was enjoying the apparent attention of the 24-year-old. Miranda Schunke was at the Old Bailey. It was a setup from the very start, say the prosecution, Leonie Granger on the left along with boyfriend, Kyrron jackson and his friend, Nicholas Chandler, were fined with a soft target with that dear cast. Mehmet Hassan fit the bill, a professional gambler who stored thousands of pounds of winnings at his home and to Leonie Granger claims was flashy. The court heard that Mehmet Hassan was enjoying the company of the woman who told him her name was Rachel. He paid for meals and even give her money to play at tables at the Palm Beach Casino on the very night he was murdered. Although well, she was keeping her two accomplices informed, so seen you when the pair were heading back to her home. Using Mehmet Hassan’s phone records, the prosecution told the jury when the taxi dropped them off in Islington, it must obtain about 12:15am. That would have been the last time that Mehmet Hassan was seen alive by anyone other than Leonie Granger and his killers. An hour later, they alleged that the attackers were let into the flat is secretly departed. The father of three was found the next day, beaten to death and his home ransacked. The three accused of his murder seemingly celebrated the spoils of their crime. It was the largest social housing estate in Europe. Now the Aylesbury Estate in Elephant and Castle is about to demolished to make way for a £1.5 billion regeneration scheme. But for the last few weeks, people have been occupying empty flats there, protesting against gentrification of the area. As Gareth Furby reports, it all came to a head last night with the police. Riot police moved in last night, their task was to end the occupation of a building on an estate which is due to be demolished. There were several arrests. The building was occupied earlier this month will stop and this estate has been the focus of a campaign, supported it seems by some residents against development. But one neighbour, watching these events, was happy to see this election. Weeks of this this urban sewers -- see this election. Weeks of this this urban sewers -- eviction. It is disgraceful. Returning to Aylesbury Estate this morning, revealed it may have achieved little. The compilers seem to have moved to another building. The protester, who didn’t want to be identified, read from a statement, explaining why they believe they can stay. The court did reject the council’s bid covering all properties on the estate. Vigorous bidding they have no power to evict us from the building until they go to court again. This is meant to be the first stage of the redevelopment involving thousands of homes, so will it now be held up? Southwark Council says no. We will continue working with the police and go through the due process to remove the protesters. We are committed to the regeneration of Aylesbury Estate. This woman loves her flat and will continue to support the campaign. We are going to fight until we get the right to stay here as a tenant. Southwark Council say the vast majority of residents want to be rehoused. Tonight though, this continues. Over a million women in London didn’t vote in the last General Election. Today Labour’s controversial ""pink bus"" rolled into Croydon to try and make sure that doesn’t happen again. The party say they want to create a more equal society, with a focus on helping women balance their work and home commitments. So, how well are they listening? Katharine Carpenter reports. Big cheers, everybody! It’s hard to imagine much overshadowing the carefully orchestrated arrival of a bright pink bus in New Addington. But two separate protests tried to do just that. In the end, Labour supporters drowned out by the anti-feminists In the end, Labour supporters drowned out both the anti-feminists and the National Front. They had plenty to say inside too. Labour’s promising to make it easier and less costly for mothers to work to tackle domestic violence, and improve pay transparency. But firstly, it just needs women to vote. Here in London alone, 1 billion women didn’t vote, and some of the women here today, we have been talking to didn’t vote last time. And they have been telling us why they didn’t think there was any point, they didn’t feel there were any politicians who were on their side that really stood for anything. The bus is on its way to Battersea, but it is hardly surprising it made its London debut here. Croydon North is a fairly safe Labour seat. Croydon South, staunchly Tory. But this central Croydon constituency is a key marginal. Labour only need around 3000 votes to win it back, and they are hoping women might be able to help. In keeping with today’s’s theme, the candidate hoping for those extra votes was selected from an all women shortlist. They want to talk about childcare, talk about the NHS, talk about how hard it is for them to work when they have got kids. They want to talk about their elderly parents that they are looking after, and once you start to have that conversation, and you have really clear policies, like more free childcare for your children, then you can start to have a bit of a relationship. At this nearby nursery, it was all about trains rather than bosses today. I asked the staff what might secure their vote. I’d like to see women get a bit more money for maternity leave, and also not to have to come back to work so quickly. Making sure that the unemployment level improves, because helping people back to work is a really important issue. Making sure that people are paid a fair wage. On that issue, the Government says today’s employment figures are encouraging. Overall, unemployment’s down in the capital compared to last year, despite rises in the last three months of 2015. What we have today is actually a record rate of women into work, record numbers of women into work, and equally, you will have women who are the carers, so they frequently will be doing part-time work or flexible work. Dismissing the pink bus as a gimmick, the Employment Minister launched her own woman’s campaign today, highlighting female role models in topjobs. The race for women’s votes is on. Lots more to come, including: Art from patients at the world’s largest psychiatric hospital goes on sale in London. And Prince Charles goes deep underground in the East End. Next, the battle between a small business and the Premier League football club, Tottenham Hotspur. A High Courtjudge will rule on Friday whether a metal works company will be made to sell up, to allow Spurs to build their new stadium. Our Sports Reporter, Chris Slegg, is here. So there’ll finally be a decision in this long-running row? There will be a decision. Whether that will be the end of the matter, we are yet to find out. This dispute has been rumbling on for many years and over the last two days, in the High Court, Archway Sheet Metal Works, the family business which doesn’t want to vacate the site have been claiming that the Compulsory Purchase Order telling them to do so is not valid. Tottenham’s current White Hart Lane Stadium holds 36,000 fans. They want to build a new stadium with 50,000 or 60,000 seats, they want more match day income to compete. They hope to open at ground in 2018 or 2019 and it will cost £400 million to do so. They have planning permission and the club say they have already agreed -- the club say they have already agreed -- amicably relocated several businesses. Archway Sheet Metal Works are the final business which are refusing to budge. Today’s proceedings began in good humour. Thejudge, a proceedings began in good humour. The judge, a self-confessed Aston Villa fan, told the court that he had received an unsolicited text message from Birmingham telling him to make Tottenham swept, and expressing this done -- dissatisfaction that Tim Sherwood has been appointed at Villa. He said this in laughter to the court. It is very serious. Archway Sheet Metal Works have become the focus for some local hostility. The court was told that the police are investigating arson as a possible line of cores with a fire that gutted their premises in November. josephjoseph premises in November. joseph joseph who premises in November. josephjoseph who runs a business, told them before that incident, but the family had received bomb threats possibly from someone unhappy at the reluctance to move on. One of the matters raised in court was whether Tottenham have the means to make this stadium a reality. They said today that Spurs have £350 million on tap, as a bridging loan from HSBC for this stadium, if it is required. So what happens next? Thejudge will make his decision public on Friday morning at 9:30am. Either party will have leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal that the decision goes against them. just before we leave you, there has been huge outrage over the Chelsea footage apparently showing football fans targeting a black man on the Paris Metro. Understandably, criticism from the highest quarters. Let’s remind ourselves what happened last night. Footage appearing to show some Chelsea fans racially abusing a black man, preventing him from boarding the train. The Metropolitan Police have said they will help the French authorities with their enquiries. Chelsea have condemned the actions and say they will also try to help identify any fans involved and they will be banned from future matches. They will leave it there. Thank you. It’s the world’s oldest psychiatric institution, treating patients with mental illnesses for nearly eight centuries. Previously known as Bedlam, over the years, Bethlam Royal Hospital in South London has acquired a significant collection art, much of it by patients. Now, it’s about to go on display in a new £4 million gallery and museum open to the public. As joe Inwood reports. It’s more than five years since Dan left Bethlem, and his recovery has gone well. It was while sectioned here, that he discovered art. I was stuck on a ward. I couldn’t get out. I worked on the same image, the same face, and it communicated, from my point of view, my own sense of darkness inside. But, it didn’t only help Dan regain his health, he also discovered a new career. It played an enormous role in my recovery, and it is nice, after all the hell, to leave hospital with something that you can be proud of. Some of Dan’s artwork is now part of the brand new Bethlem gallery and Museum Of The Mind. It cost £4 million to build, and houses what is thought to be one of the most significant collections of its kind. We have works of art by people who are patients at Bethlem, and the Maudsley Hospital and elsewhere. But some of those patients are also internationally renowned artists. We also have works that are of real historic value as well. From Caius Cibber’s statues of raving and melancholy madness, which once stood at the entrance to Bedlam, to works by former patients, like William Kurelek’s The Maze, and Richard Dadd, admitted after murdering his own father. The Bethlem is believed to be the oldest psychiatric institution in the world. The collections that we have got here go back to the 1500s. But while it’s the hospital’s past on display here, the aim of the project is slightly more forward-looking. If the 20th century was the century of the body, I think the 21st-century will be the century of the mind. I think the more we can understand that, through art and creative practices, the better. Over the centuries that Bethlem has stood, the public’s fascination with mental illness is undimmed. Thankfully, our understanding of it has moved on rather more. His great, great grandfather opened one back in 1865. But today, Prince Charles followed in the King’s footsteps and went deep underground to a new sewer tunnel in the East End. The visit was to mark the 150-year anniversary of the capital’s sewers. Thankfully, the section he visited isn’t operational yet. We sent our correspondent, Nick Higham, below ground. 75 metres down, they were sweeping the Lee tunnel clean this morning. Ironic, when you think what it will be used for. But then the Prince of Wales was coming, to admire a 21st-century equivalent of one of the greatest feats of Victorian engineering. The original Victorian system was designed very, very well by Sirjoseph Bazalgette, at a time when London was 2 million people, he had the foresight to design it to handle 4 million people. London now is 8 million people, the system is overwhelmed. It still works well, but gets overwhelmed, and so that is why they this is being put in place. The great engineer, joseph Bazalgette, designed and built a network of super sewers, to stop millions of gallons of raw sewage being dumped into the Thames. joseph Bazalgette is something of an engineering genius, and his genius lay notjust in the design, but in the sheer method he applied. He checked every segment of cement, checked every connection to the sewers personally. He was very vigorous in organising in that sense. He pulled this off when lots of people said it wouldn’t happen. Among joseph Bazalgette achievements, the new embankment beside the Thames, which held one of his sewers, and an underground railway. And he designed great pumping stations like this. Temples of engineering, to keep all that muck moving. The whole system is a monument to the scale and ambition that those great Victorian engineers. It is also a monument to the great stink of 1558, when the stench of accumulated sewage on the Thames grew so overpowering that MPs in Parliament finally agreed to allow the project to go ahead. These sewers were big, but today’s super sewers are even bigger, and good, it is hoped, for another 150 years. Now let’s get a look at the weather forecast. It almost lookalikes bring. I am afraid it will not last. Barely a cloud today. The temperature is cold to 11 Celsius. Is it felt like spring today, over the next few days it will start to feel seasonal, not snow or ice, but some strong winds and spells of rain, really unpleasant. We lose high-pressure, and then a succession of weather fronts. Across the Atlantic, many weather systems. fronts. Across the Atlantic, many weathersystems. It weather systems. It will be quite unpleasant on many other days through the next few. Windy on Sunday. Really gusty conditions. Let’s look at that in detail. We still have high pressure at the moment, clearskies. still have high pressure at the moment, clear skies. A fine start to the night withjust moment, clear skies. A fine start to the night with just a little moment, clear skies. A fine start to the night withjust a little bit the night with just a little bit of a breeze blowing. Through the night there will be more cloud from the West and by the time we get to the early hours we will have lost the temperatures. A touch of frost possible. Towards the end of the night it’ll be three or five Celsius. Tomorrow we will have plenty of cloud from the West, eventually the rain will arrive into the afternoon. Some heavy bursts of free in late afternoon. Overnight as well. The winds will pick up and temperatures may get to 10 Celsius. Underneath the rain and wind it won’t feel very nice. We have got a pretty nice day on Saturday. There will be some fine weather there. Even on Friday, the low-pressure looks as though it will track across the south of the UK. Heavy rain and strong winds. Sunday is looking awful at the moment. Not much better on Monday. Saturday is oK. The main headlines. The number of people in Britain who are unemployed has fallen by 97,000. Unemployment now stands at 1.86 million. That’s almost half a million down on a year ago, and the lowest rate for six years. Footage has emerged which appears to show Chelsea fans preventing a black man from boarding a train in Paris, and shouting racist abuse. The incident took place before a Champions League match. Chelsea Football Club have said any fans involved face a ban. In Ukraine, government forces have pulled out of a strategic town in the east of the country, where forces were fighting against Russian-backed separatists. That’s it, thanks forjoining us. Plenty more on our website, and I’ll be back later during the 10pm news. From me and the team here, have a lovely evening. In 2010, Britain was facing a major financial and economic crisis. So the Conservatives took difficult decisions that have halved the deficit as a share of our economy, and got Britain back on track. We’ve backed Britain’s businesses, cutting their taxes, reducing red tape, and investing in vital roads, rail and infrastructure. As a result, in just five years, there are 760,000 more businesses in our country. Since we started brewing three years ago, sales have gone so well, we are moving into our new, bigger premises this year and taking on more staff. We have been openjust over six months now and business is going really, really well. We have helped Britain’s businesses grow and create jobs. Thanks to the measures we’ve taken and the hard work of people across the country, there are now 1.75 million more people in work, with the security of a pay packet to provide for theirfamilies. Now that I’ve got a job, after being out of work for so long, it feels amazing to know that I am providing to give my son a better life. To help young people learn the skills they need to get on in life, we’ve delivered two million new apprenticeships. My apprenticeship has given me the knowledge and confidence to progress in life. Thanks to my apprenticeship, the future is bright. By backing businesses and helping create morejobs and opportunities, we’ve got Britain going again. And our economy was the fastest-growing of all major advanced nations last year. I’m proud to employ local people. We had a good year last year and we’re going to have an even better year this year. With our exports growing, we have the confidence now to start looking at employing more people. With a strong economy, we can invest in the things that matter to hard-working families - new schools, so children get the best start in life, front-line health services, so your family get the care they need. We can’t go back to Labour’s way of more borrowing and higher taxes. Instead, we need to stick to the plan that is giving families peace of mind and security for the future. The choice at this election is really clear. It’s between a strong, competent team that have a long-term economic plan which is working, or the chaos of giving up on the progress that we’ve made and going backwards. We should stick with the plan. Stay on course for prosperity, and work to secure a better future for our children and grandchildren. Comic Relief has crashed the Bake Off tent. That sponge is awful. What?! Uh-oh... Aagh! What’s going on? It’s exceptionally good for your first time. Hello and welcome to The One Show. With Matt Baker. And Alexjones. We set you a challenge to send us in your artwork which contains the number one in it somewhere. For those of you who haven’t heard about this tonight, we’re going to give you another 20 minutes. So get cracking and we’ll show you our favourite at the end of the programme. We’ve had some in already. We’ll also be talking about Salvador Dali’s The Christ of Saint john of the Cross, how it was created and how it came under attack. And we’ll be talking to an actress who was so inspired by her recent co-stars that she painted these. Who could it be? It’s Sherlock’s housekeeper, Una Stubbs. APPLAUSE Delightful to see you. We love the artwork. Thank you. It’s absolutely beautiful. It was on display at the Royal Academy in the summer. I try to get a likeness from as few strokes as possible. Have the boys seen them? I don’t know. I didn’t mention it! Congratulations to Benedict. Congratulations all-rounder! Did it affect the filming schedule? I’ve just finished filming. That gets really exciting. It’s an extraordinary story. That will get people chatting away like you wouldn’t believe. But your lips are sealed, aren’t they? Oh yes. I’ve signed a thing. With better not go anywhere near that! Mountaineering news doesn’t get much bigger than this. The route used to climb Mount Everest is going to change. We’re going to be chatting to Mollie Hughes, the first British woman hoping to climb Everest from both the north and south sides. Let’sjust hope she’s not wearing that, she might overheat! First here’s the story of a group of people slightly older than Mollie, who went on their own brave journey. This tranquil village is notjust any old journey. This tranquil village is not just any old village. And the people here aren’tjust not just any old village. And the people here aren’t just any old people. This is Woodchester Valley village. It’s thought to be the very first mutually owned retirement community in the country. Because the people who live here aren’t just residents, they run the place. ",,
118,BBC1 London,18-feb-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"LAUGHTER And the whole thing of going to public toilets is a traumatic and difficult experience - and for that reason, this is very close, but I am going to put bad urinal etiquette into Room 101. APPLAUSE CHEERING And that brings us to the end of the show. Well done, Brendan, you were the most persuasive guest tonight, so you are this week’s winner. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Well done, Brendan. Well done. So, thanks very much to Brendan O’Carroll, Bob Mortimer and Rachel Riley, and thank you, good night. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING EastEnders live week continues with a special double bill... Unemployment falls again as pay continues to outstrip inflation. There are now 31 million people in work, the highest number since records began, and average pay is on the up. We do increase their pay - and we have done, by about 5%. People aren’t being paid a lot more, but we are managing to maintain pay levels. We’ll be looking at whether people really are feeling better off. Also tonight, a major setback for Ukraine as government troops are forced to withdraw from a key town by Russian separatists. Police try to track down the Chelsea fans who repeatedly pushed a black man from a Paris train, chanting racist songs. And why Prince Charles has spent the day in a sewer 250 feet below London’s East End. Later on BBC London News, the increasing number of attacks on Tube workers - it’s almost doubled in five years. And the businesses saying they’re being forced out of the capital to make way for housing. Good evening. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in more than six years. 1.86 million people are currently out of work. And pay has risen more than the cost of living for the fourth month in a row, with average earnings up by 2.1%. The Government welcomed the figures, calling them proof that their economic plan was working. But Labour says millions are still struggling to make ends meet. Here’s our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz. One rise leads to another- the uplift injobs carries on, helping to spark a jump in pay, including at this steel business at King’s Lynn in Norfolk, one of the areas leading the wage recovery. Stuart had a 5% rise last year. He’s expecting the same again, and he’s working overtime on top. We’ve put a deposit for a house, so we’ve got a mortgage, we have new cars and, you know, our way of living is better. This is for combine harvesters, different attachments... There were six staff in the business four years ago, now there are 36, and they want to keep them. We’re trying to look after our skilled employees, because we’re quite aware that they can move on or get poached, so we do try and look after them. And with us growing, we look at our financial figures, and they’ve allowed us to give them a pay increase each year. King’s Lynn is one of the places where pay has been rising fastest, but it’s from a low base - there are still plenty of people who feel worse off than they were before the recession. I’m on quite a low income, my husband himself works nights, and he hasn’t had a pay rise for three, four years or something like that. So if it is increasing, it would be very slowly. We are still on minimum wage, which is not good enough for what care work we do. The minimum wage has increased, but at this floorboard makers nearby it’s the only pressure pushing up wages. There’s no great pay rises around at the moment. When we look to recruit more people to replace people, we have no trouble in finding applicants. We have about 30 or 1+0 applicants perjob. A big slice came off pay rises in the wake of the recession. Unemployment peaked at nearly 2.7 million before dropping sharply over the last two years. Here’s the effect on pay, which slumped - most workers struggling ever since to persuade employers to give them the big increases they remember. Wages are still going up, but they’re only going up at 1% or 2%, and that compares to 1+% to 5% before the recession. So until we see wages go back to where we think they ought to be, I don’t think people are going to give the good news quite the credit it deserves. What’s making the difference here and across the country is petrol and other prices dropping. It means any extra money goes much further. Simon Gompertz, BBC News, in King’s Lynn. Our political correspondent Ben Wright is in Westminster. Good economic news, but what is the political impact? Speaker well, most elections in the end of it on the economy, and clearly the coalition parties now have a strong clutch of economic facts and figures to trumpet. David Cameron said today that the that the numbers were a good sign but he will not see ministers doing cartwheels triumphalism, because in part a key plank of their election strategy is to insist that this economic recovery remains fragile, the economy is still convalescing. They argue it should not be risked by a change of government, and we have been hearing how many people do not feel much better off at all after five years of this government, which is why Labour is not going to be dropping its mantra that there is a cost of living crisis. They argue there are far too many low-paid jobs, that is a structural issue, they say the recovery was delayed by government policy, and they also point out that this low inflation we are enjoying is because of global oil and food prices, not wizardry within the Government. It is shaping UP within the Government. It is shaping up to be a classic economy election - Labour asking voters weather they feel better off, the Conservatives asking voters to give them a chance to finish off the job, and the answer will not be clear-cut. In eastern Ukraine, there’s been a large scale retreat of government forces after weeks of heavy fighting against Russian backed separatists. Despite last week’s cease-fire, the battles had intensified in recent days, with the rebels determined to take the key town of Debaltseve. From eastern Ukraine, Ian Pannell reports. Not waving but drowning - this was a humiliating defeat for Ukrainian troops. They called it a withdrawal. In reality, it was a retreat. Their president said they left Debaltseve in a planned and organised way. Tell that to two brothers in arms who escaped under cover of darkness. Yuri says individual units took their own decision to leave, afraid of being surrounded and out of ammunition. This is the rebels’ prize - Debaltseve, or what’s left of it. It’s a key strip of land that links two bits of their territory. We drove towards the town today, down long empty roads towards the rebel front lines. What many fight for here is notjust land but independence. This war has pitched east against West, Britain and America accusing Russia of working in the shadows, sneaking men and munitions across the border to help the to victory. The Kremlin flatly denies it, accusing the west of interfering in Ukraine’s affairs. This checkpoint is about seven kilometres from the town of Debaltseve, and the rebel troops who are manning it will not allow us to go any further down the road. We are hearing reports that Ukrainian troops are pulling out of the town, at least some of them, but fighting is still going on, and we have heard a lot of outgoing firing and witnessed some coming back in our direction. Do not forget those caught up in this war. 5500 people in Ukraine have been killed since it began. More than 1.5 million have been forced to leave their homes. Almost a week after a deal was signed to bring peace to Ukraine, there is little sign of it. TRANSLATION: Debaltseve has been taken, and all we have to do is push them back 15, does the town is no longer under threat. We are going on a clear up operation because the Ukrainians have scattered into the fields. -- 15 Ukrainians have scattered into the fields. --15 kilometres. These are the men he leads the foreign volunteers of the international brigade, pulling on the white armbands that marks them out as rebel fighters. Tonight they are heading back to Debaltseve. The prospect of peace looks in doubt. Ian is in the rebel-held town of Donetsk tonight. The ceasefire has been looking fragile since it was announced, what are the chances of it holding? Yeah, I think that is the key question tonight. The truth is that the guns have fallen silent in many places, indeed the people who were in control here, the self-declared Donetskaya is, were today putting on a display the fact that they work with drawing guns in some areas. -- Donetsk people’s republic. But there are key strategic areas where the guns have not fallen silent, and here, in Donetsk, out towards the airport, the guns have been firing, and there has been fighting in Marriott ball on both sides. So the question is, for the rebel side, is Debaltseve enough? We know that it matters to them, a key strategic transport hub that effectivelyjoins UP transport hub that effectivelyjoins up two pieces of territory that they were already in control of. But when you talk to people, you get the impression, certainly in terms of more hardline rebel commanders, that it will not be enough. They talk about the entire Donbass region, and that means pushing everfurther west. People are tired of the situation, they are exhausted from war, it has been going on for a long time, and many people who I’d hoped that this peace agreement would allow them to return to their homes have been disappointed. There is very little hope, very little optimism, but if Debaltseve is enough, and we have heard from the rebel leader who said that he thought it was not covered by the Minsk agreement, that the ceasefire would hold in other areas, and if thatis would hold in other areas, and if that is true, despite what has happened over the last few days, despite what has happened to the Ukrainian forces and the blood that has been spilt, perhaps there is a chance for peace. But we will not really know until we see the pattern of events of the next few days. And one final thought, the last peace deal broke down over these key flash points. It was not about a larger picture, it was about contested territory and the larger ambitions. We willjust have to wait and see whether they want to push on, and whether they do, the peace deal will end and the war will continue. Scotland Yard says it’s investigating whether a group of Chelsea football fans who were filmed preventing a black man getting on a train in Paris can be banned from football. The incident happened before a Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain last night. The amateur video footage shows the fans repeatedly pushing the man from the carriage and chanting racist songs, as Natalie Pirks reports. Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea! A pre-match scene in Paris is about to turn ugly. On the crowded Metro in rush hour, a black man tries to board a train packed with Chelsea fans. He’s forcibly pushed off the train - twice. Unashamed, the chant from some of them leaves passengers in no doubt why they did it. The first black player to play for Chelsea believes the shocking footage isn’t representative of true fans. Once I saw the video, I was completely so angry, I was really astonished, I was amazed. Where did this come from? I don’t want people to think, oh, my God, it’s gone back to the haunting days of the 1980s, or when I used to play, cos it’s not like that at all. And I believe in that. Yet a Chelsea fan who was on the train claims the chanting was actually about their captain. I heard something along the lines of, ""john Terry, he’s a racist, and we love it."" Do you say the pushing and chanting were not related? Of course, they were not connected. It’s a person trying to make something out of nothing, as usual. Chelsea had battled hard last night for a draw against Paris Saint-Germain. Six of the squad who travelled are black. Here at Stamford Bridge, the club has described the behaviour of those fans as abhorrent and said they will take the strongest possible action, including banning orders, if any of them are shown to be season-ticket holders or members. Tonight football supporters from other teams have condemned the Chelsea minority. Chelsea seem to have calmed down a bit, and so do some of the other fans, over the years, so why is it happening now? Itjust doesn’t make sense. It spoils it for the rest of us, doesn’t it, for the good lads? So it’s a shame. I thought that’d gone, kick racism out of football, it’s been gone for ages, so yeah, very surprised. No to racism. Uefa has done a lot of work in this field, but today said it could not take action because the incident occurred away from the stadium. But the Met Police can act. It’s confirmed they’ll be assisting the French police to review the footage. Once identified, those involved could face up to three years in prison. Natalie Pirks, BBC News. Italy is warning that it can’t cope with the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to reach its shores. The Italian government says that 5,300 migrants arrived in the country in the first six weeks of this year. That’s a 60% increase from the same period last year. And it’s expected that more people will make the treacherous journey, because of the instability in countries like Libya and Syria. Tom Burridge sent this report from the Italian island of Lampedusa. Life jackets for those rescued at sea. New Italian coastguard video filmed during the day and at night of the long rescue operation that went on for days. One of those rescued was this girl, aged 15 months. She’s now in Lampedusa with her parents, four brothers and sisters and her cousin. He travelled from Syria where there’s war, crossed four countries, and reached Libya, where there’s also war. There he caught this boat and on his phone filmed the beginning of 12-hours at sea. We were 200 person on the boat. The boat is 16 meters, but very old. What did you think might happen? We will die in the sea. But he survived and now wants to travel north. We can live in Sweden. It’s good country. There’s no war. We met this group of Eritreans in their newjackets, handed out at Lampedusa’s church. 13-year-old Tacler is here without his parents. 19-year-old Eopp has another European destination in mind. I like going to England. You’d like to go to England? Yeah. But for now they’re all here. Yesterday, Lampedusa’s reception centre was struggling to cope. Today, it was calmer. More room, and more basic supplies for the men, women and children. That’s because hundreds have been moved off this tiny island to other parts of Italy. An Italian search and rescue operation, called Mare Nostrum, has been replaced by an EU led mission, with fewer boats, which patrol closer to Europe’s coast. Further south in Lampedusa, near to Libya, where there’s civil war, the flow of flimsy boats has only increased. Infact, a record number of migrants has now reached these shores in the first six weeks of this year. As spring approaches, an even greater number will arrive. Charities warn that unless there are more boats patrolling these waters, many more people will die. This time it’s a story of survival, but for every boat that’s rescued, another is on its way. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in Lampedusa. A 16-year-old from Greater Manchester has been charged with terrorism offences. Police say the boy - who can’t be named for legal reasons - was attempting to acquire a biological toxin. They’ve stressed there is no intelligence to suggest that communities within the Greater Manchester area are at risk in relation to the investigation. The European Central Bank has reportedly agreed to raise the emergency funding available to Greek banks tojust over £50 emergency funding available to Greek banks to just over £50 billion. Greece’s new left-wing government says it will ask for a six-month extension of its bail out loan tomorrow, but won’t accept any deal which requires strict austerity measures. Police in Switzerland have searched the Geneva offices of the Swiss private arm of HSBC, as part of a money laundering inquiry. Prosecutors said the investigation was prompted by the recent publication of leaked documents indicating the bank had helped wealthy clients evade taxes. HSBC said it was co-operating with the Swiss authorities. Last week, it apologised for what it called ""historical events"" and said procedures at its Swiss bank had been completely overhauled. Well, it comes after the journalist Peter Oborne quit as the Daily Telegraph’s chief political commentator, after accusing his former paper of downplaying stories about HSBC because the banking giant is a major advertiser. The Telegraph has rejected his claims. Tonight the BBC has been told that executives at the paper had been asked them to hand over information relating to an HSBC story. David Sillitojoins me now from outside the Telegraph’s offices. journalists are allowed to report what they discover, that news is written for readers not advertisers. Companies shouldn’t be allowed to veto stories. Oborne b said that barrier has been repeatedly broken. He said commercial concerns had been driving decisions about news stories. A number of companies he mentioned, most importantinglily a lack of coverage about HSBC, tax. He was a loning and angry voice. Tonight we have been told those echoes are being concerned. We have spoken to seniorfigures who being concerned. We have spoken to senior figures who worked at the Telegraph they, off-the-record, have said they agree with much of what Peter oborne has been saying. We learnt there was an investigation in 2012 into HSBC by the Telegraph and they came to an end when they were asked to hand over leaked data to an executive outside of the editorial department. They were worried about this they blanked out much of that data they were worried their source was about to be identified. What is the Daily Telegraph saying about all this tonight? The allegations, all of them, they say, are utterly unfounded. They say the barrier between news and advertising here is absolutely fundamental. HSBC meanwhile absolutely fundamental. HSBC meanwhile has said, no comment. David, thank you. jeb Bush, who’s hoping to be the Republican candidate for the US presidency in 2016, has insisted that he is his ""own man."" been Presidents of the United States -- said his views were shaped by his own thinking and experiences. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, was listening to his speech. jeb Bush isn’t yet a candidate for the presidency, but it’s sure beginning to look and feel like he will be. The money’s pouring in and today he was setting out his foreign policy ideas. America, he said, had lost the confidence of its friends and no longer inspired fear in her enemies. There was one other thing he had to address, his family name. I love my brother. I love my dad. I actually love my mother as well - I hope that’s oK! I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions that they had to make. But I’m my own man and my views are shaped by my own thinking, and my own experiences. But a study by the Washington Post found of the 21 people now advising him on foreign policy, 19 had worked for either his father or brother, or both. When George HW Bush became President in 1988, he was the 1+1st President of the United States. His son, George W, was the 1+3rd, and ifjeb were to become president he’d become the 1+5th. Then it would seem that every other president has to be a Bush. jeb Bush would be the Republican establishment candidate if he won the nomination and the right will be determined to stop him in his tracks. But if he did, and it’s a big but, the most likely Democratic candidate that he’ll be facing would be Hillary Clinton. Then it would begin to seem that in the land of opportunity, with its population of 320 million people, that anyone can become president. Oh, so long as your name is either Clinton or Bush. jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories. A woman’s been arrested at Heathrow airport, on suspicion of terrorism offences, relating to Syria. The 25 year old, from Birmingham, was also arrested on suspicion of child neglect and abduction. She had travelled from Turkey. Police say there was no threat to the safety of the flight or the airport. Darren Clarke has been named as the new Europe captain for next year’s Ryder Cup. He takes over from Paul McGinley. Clarke, who’s from Northern Ireland, has played in five Ryder Cups and won four. Engineers have discovered that the teeth of a limpet are made up of the strongest natural material ever tested - beating even spider silk. It’s down to the thinness and the structure of the teeth and it’s hoped the discovery can improve every day designs, from cars and planes to dental fillings. Waiting times at Accident and Emergency departments in hospitals in Wales improved slightly in january, but are still below target and lagging behind England’s. just over 82% of patients were seen within four hours, well short of the 95% target. The latest figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland have not been published yet. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, reports from South Wales. It’s a crucial meeting at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. Nursing staff and doctors monitoring how full the wards are, as the patients keep on arriving at Accident & Emergency. There isn’t a lot of available bed space. So what we have to do is manage our demand and capacity so that we know where our pinch points are. That’s looked at in detail every day. Here, the system has led to improved performance. But elsewhere in Wales, Accident & Emergency units are still under immense pressure, with waiting times falling well short of the Government target. It’s just the waiting time. The staff are so overworked anyway. There’s just not enough staff and too many patients. Especially in the evenings, you know people with alcohol problems, and things like that. It’s not an environment I’d like to be in. In the long-term, doctors say pressure on hospitals can be eased by better management of patients with chronic conditions. It looks like a hospital, but this is a special facility for training medical students in community healthcare. Getting the doctors of the future to understand better how to look after patients closer to home, so reducing emergency admissions to hospitals. The Welsh Government has been criticised over its health record, but it argues that social care, including looking after the elderly in their homes, is also vital. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that between 2010 and 2011+ health spending in England rose by 1+.3% while the Welsh Government cut its health budget by 2%. But for social care provided by local authorities there was a drop in England of 11.5% while in Wales the equivalent budget was reduced byjust 0.8%. While Accident & Emergency performance in Wales lags behind England and Scotland, figures today showed waits for cancer treatment were better than in England. Right now it’s a highly charged political debate. Hugh Pym, BBC News. Prince Charles has spent his day in a sewer, 250 feet under the East End of London. The visit was to mark the 150th anniversary of the capital’s sewers. Though thankfully the section the Prince visited is new and not yet operational. Our correspondent, Nick Higham, followed him down. 75 meters down and they were sweeping the Lee Tunnel clean this morning. Ironic, when you think what it’ll be used for. But then the Prince of Wales was coming to admire a 21st Century equivalent of one of the greatest feats of Victorian engineering. The original Victorian system was designed very, very well by Sirjoseph Bazalgette. At the time, when London was two million people, he had the foresight to design it to handle four million people. London now is eight million people, the system is overwhelmed, still works well, but gets overwhelmed. The great engineer, Sirjoseph Bazalgette, had designed and built a network of super sewers to stop millions of gallons of raw sewage being dumped into the Thames. Bazalgette is something of an engineering genius and his genius lay as much, not in the designs, but the sheer method he applied. You know, he checked every connection in the sewers personally. He was very vigorous and organised in that sense. Among Bazalgette’s achievements, two great pumping stations like this, temples of engineering to keep all that muck moving. The whole system is a monument to the scale and ambition of those great Victorian engineers. It’s also a monument to the great stink of 1858, when the stench of accumulated sewage in the Thames grew so overpowering that MPs in Parliament finally agreed to allow the project to go-ahead. Bazalgette’s sewers were big, but today’s super sewers are even bigger and good, it’s hoped, for another 150 years. Nick Higham, BBC News, East London.

Newsnight’s about to begin over on BBC Two in a few moments. Here’s Evan. Tonight, more on the Telegraph which stands accused of blurring advertising and editorial. And, what people say about politics around the kitchen table. join me over on BBC Two. That’s all from us. Now, on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good night. Tonight on BBC London News, the increasing number of attacks on Tube workers, it’s almost doubled in five years. We’re very concerned, especially with all-night running on the amount of passengers who are going to be intoxicated on the trains, that this is only going to get worse. Transport for London bosses say they’ll fight for prosecutions. Also tonight, the businesses forced out of the capital to make way for housing. And Labour’s pink bus rolls into Croydon to hear the issues that matter to women. Plus, all change with the weather, your local and national forecase coming up. your local and national forecast coming up. Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. Tube staff are facing increasing abuse from angry passengers, according to new figures. The number of assaults on Underground staff has gone up by 44%, it’s almost almost doubled in the last five years. London Underground says the reporting of abuse has increased and the figures reflect more verbal abuse than physical. But unions say many staff feel at constant risk of attack. Tarah Welsh reports. A man’s foot stuck in a door, and he seems frustrated. A member of staff is pushed, the man shouts and swears. This footage is filmed by a passer-by, and it seems these incidents aren’t uncommon. Imagine when you got up in the morning, you knew that there was a one in four chance you would be abused at work that day. That’s what London Underground staff face, and there are seven attacks every single day. Last year, there were 2,753. Verbal assaults made up half. 35% were threats of violence, and 16% were actually physical attacks. And when we went underground today, the first employee we spoke to off-camera told us he had been abused and spat at. And this is called the DNA collection pit... Infact, they have even ruled out these DNA kits to trace people that spit that staff and, critics feel that attacks could increase when jobs are cut and the Tube starts running through the night. Three weeks ago, someone had their faces slahed at a station. We are very concerned with the amount of passengers overnight who could be intoxicated on trains, this will only get worse. A 1+1+% rise of crime in five years, in assaults. It is notjust staff but also customers. We are making changes in how we staff are stations. We’re moving people out from ticket offices, more visible staff to help customers. Four night Tubes are actually recruiting more staff to work at stations at night. There will be a greater visibility and we will continue to work with the British Transport Police, who do a greatjob to keep the Tube a safe place. London Underground say that crime on the Tube is archly going down by 11+%, year-on-year, and that the rise in staff incidents could be because people are encouraged to report it more. But that won’t necessarily reassure those that face the public and potentially abuse every single day. Chris Rogersjoins me now. Tonight, the transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy has given his reaction to this. Yes, he has been speaking to the BBC this evening. We heard in that report a lot of anger in reaction to these new statistics, but he tried to play down that anger, saying, we go to the ends of the earth to find those responsible for attacks on staff. He says, we do prosecute them. He says, if necessary, we privately prosecute them of the police do not get involved. But he added that the transport police generally do a good job, so some reassuring that victims can get justice, but not much reassurance. And people who use the shove macro that they can stop the attacks in the first place. Next, a warning that traditional manufacturing jobs in the capital are set to disappear all together in the next 50 years. With land prices at a premium in the capital, industrial sites are being lost to redevelopment, many of them to new housing. The Green Party on the London Assembly are concerned that the Mayor’s too focused on providing thousand of new homes. Our political correspondent Karl Mercer reports. Tucked away in Hackney Wick is a famous brewing name reborn in the East End. A couple of hundred yards from the Olympic Stadium, Truman’s is pumping out 70,000 pints of beer a week. But this is a business that could be on the move to make way for housing. These are fermentation vessels, so the beer will stay in here for a week or sometimes more than a week. It’s always been an industrial area, has been for hundreds of years, and it’s now rapidly becoming a housing development. It’s already started nibbling at the edges, and as we go block by block, it’s all disappearing, and we’ve been informed in the last year that our block will also be developed into housing within the next five years. Next door, this kitchen workshop faces a similar fate. It’s already had to move four times, getting further and further from central London every time it moves. The question is if... once you get a certain distance out, do you then try and move right out of London to get cheaper space? And there isn’t a lot, cos I’ve looked several times. There isn’t a lot available. So these kind of industrial parks are good for us, exactly this kind of space. I believe in this area, in Fish Island, they are building hundreds and hundreds of new flats. And there’s no more industrial space. It’s an issue highlighted today by Greens on the London Assembly. Yes, they say, London needs more homes, but not at the expense of industrial units like these. Obviously, we have a housing crisis in London, and I’m really supportive of building more houses. But we need the jobs as well. It isjust mad to push out viable businessesjust to build housing, when it means losing skilled manualjobs. It means more lorry movements on our roads. It potentially means higher prices, if you push the businesses far enough out. They’ re absolutely right, and we have to be careful, but we are being very careful, we’re notjust letting go any of the core industrial land. There is a lot of industrial land which is very lightly used at the moment with relatively little employment on it. And particularly that which is near transport nodes is idealfor housing. City Hall said the mayor’s infrastructure plan would balance the need for London’s growing population, both in terms of where it lives and where it works. The parents The pa re nts of The parents of a 1 -year-old have agreed to take off life support after a decision in the High Court. Great Ormond Street Hospital wanted to discontinue her treatments, which it said were not in their best interests. Her parents had plans to fight this but changed their minds this afternoon. Ajury at the Old Bailey has been hearing details of how a young woman accused of the honey-trap murder of a professional poker player changed her name as she targeted the 56-year-old for his cash. The court heard that Leonie Granger from Gillingham called herself Rachel when she met Mehmet Hassan. The jury was told phone records suggested Mr Hassan, from Islington, enjoyed the apparent attention from her. Ms Granger and two men deny murder. The Charity Commission is to investigate the activities of the Durand Education Trust, which is affiliated with a south London school. The Durand Academy in Stockwell has been praised in the past as outstanding. Now the Charity Commission says it will investigate whether conflicts of interest were affecting the Durand Education Trust. The academy says it welcomes the investigation and that it will have no impact on the day-to-day running of the school. Over a million women in London didn’t vote in the last general election. Today Labour’s controversial pink bus rolled into Croydon to try entice more of them to the ballot box this May. with a focus on helping women balance work and home commitments. Katharine Carpenter reports from south London. Big cheers, everybody! It’s hard to imagine much overshadowing the carefully orchestrated arrival of a bright pink bus in New Addington. But two separate protests tried to do just that. In the end, Labour supporters drowned out both the anti-feminists and the National Front. What issues are you most concerned about? They had plenty to say inside too. Labour’s promising to make it easier and less costly for mothers to work, to tackle domestic violence, and iITIpIâoVâ pay tI’8I’ISp8IââI’ICy. But firstly, it just needs women to vote. Here in London alone, 1 million women didn’t vote, and some of the women here today we have been talking to didn’t vote last time. And they have been telling us why they didn’t think there was any point, they didn’t feel there were any politicians who were on their side that really stood for anything. The bus is on its way to Battersea, but it is hardly surprising it made its London debut here. Croydon North is a fairly safe Labour seat. Croydon South - staunchly Tory. But this central Croydon constituency is a key marginal. Labour only need around 3,000 votes to win it back, and they are hoping women might be able to help. In keeping with today’s theme, the candidate hoping for those extra votes was selected from an all women shortlist. They want to talk about childcare, talk about the NHS, talk about how hard it is for them to work when they have got kids. They want to talk about their elderly parents that they are looking after, and once you start to have that conversation, and you have really clear policies, like more free childcare for your children, then you can start to have a bit of a relationship. At this nearby nursery, it was all about trains rather than buses today. I asked the staff what might secure their vote. I’d like to see women get a bit more money for maternity leave, and also not to have to come back to work so quickly. Making sure that the unemployment level improves, because helping people back to work is a really important issue. Making sure that people are paid a fair wage. On that issue, the Government says today’s employment figures are encouraging. Overall, unemployment’s down in the capital compared to last year, despite rises in the last three months of 2015. What we have today is actually a record rate of women into work, record numbers of women into work, and equally, you will have women who are the carers, so they frequently will be doing part-time work or flexible work. Dismissing the pink bus as a gimmick, the Employment Minister launched her own woman’s campaign today, highlighting female role models in topjobs. The race for women’s votes is on. Producers say a fire on the set of EastEnders won’t affect plans for a week of live broadcasts to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Crews from Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue were called out to the Elstree Studios at around 11 o’clock last night. It’s thought the incident was caused by a firework. That’s it from me, so I’ll wish you a very good night and leave you with Wendy Hurrell who’s got the forecast for us. You may be forgiven for hoping that spring is around the corner, but I’m afraid of the next few days bring reverts to window once again. Not in terms of snow perhaps, but a seasonal feel do things, and that is thanks to the high pressure waning, and instead low pressure from the Atlantic trailing weather fronts back across it, this one for Sunday will bring quite gusty winds as well. But at the moment, actually, it is the breeze that is our friend, because it will keep things stirred UP because it will keep things stirred up a bit as we go through the night, and it means, despite the clear sky, we shouldn’t have too much of a frost, if any, 3-5 is our temperature, and when you get to work early, you might actually see some sunshine, but the wind will increase, it will continue to cloud over, and in the evening rush-hour there will be some persistent and sometimes heavy rain which will continue into the first part of the night as well. Let’s have a look at the outlook, because on Friday there is another spell of rain which will be heavy, setting in during the afternoon. A better day on Saturday, thatis afternoon. A better day on Saturday, that is the one I am looking forward to, but on Sunday it will turn wet through the day with quite gusty winds, feeling chilly and blustery until Monday. Not quite asjelly has some parts of the United States at the moment, john Hammond will tell us about that, and he has our national forecast. Hold onto your hats, it will be hard to keep up with the weather over the next week or so, constant change from place to place and from day to day. 16 degrees today, the warmest day of the year so far in Scotland, but 6 degrees will be more typical tomorrow because of this cold front coming across Scotland. Heavy rain for a time, particularly out west, and that will be arriving across north-western England and Wales by the end of the night. A chilly evening across the far South East, but by dawn temperatures well above freezing. Tomorrow will be a different day compared with today for most of us. For Northern Ireland and Scotland, some sunshine, a chilly breeze, wintry showers of high ground. For England and Wales, where some of us had a gloriously sunny day, complete transformation tomorrow. It looks a bit grim, outbreaks of rain, some quite heavy and persistent. Mind you, it will take all day for that rain to arrive across the south-east and East Anglia. Cool and drive elsewhere. Rain lingering across northern England for a time, the best of the sunshine across Northern Ireland and Scotland in the afternoon. Showers across the mountains and the North West of Scotland will turn quite wintry, and wintry showers will continue across the Highlands. The rain will clear out of the south-east, jelly for a time, and then the next area of high pressure on the conveyor brings rain into southern areas. -- on the conveyor brings rain into southern areas. -- chilly. The northern half of the UK should see the best of the sunshine, further wintry showers, and eventually on Friday brightening up across western parts of England and Wales. That theme continues into the weekend, if you have got plans for the outdoors, Saturday is probably the best bet. Showers and sunshine. Sunday doesn’t look clever at all, wind and rain spreading in from the West. That continues into next week, and this is a stylised of, waves of wet and windy weather crossing country, then clearing. -- wet and windy weather crossing country, then clearing. -- stylised view. Another batch of strong winds and heavy rain will sweep in, then yet again clearer skies. A bit of a roller-coaster, I think Tonight’s sporting stars are European Tour golfer Marc Warren, triple jump world record holder jonathan Edwards, Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Rebecca Adlington and a Grand Slam winner with Wales - Martyn Williams. Let’s play A Question of Sport. Hello and welcome to the show. The teams are both raring to go, so let’s see who is quick out of the blocks as we start with the Picture Board. But the Picture Board is a little different tonight. On the board are six categories. Behind each of them there will be a number of sports stars whose surnames combine to form something from that category. So, Matt, your team have first pick. What do you fancy? Now... Politics. Are you any good with politics? No, but let’s do it. Politics, please. You’re going politics. OK. Very educated on this side of the room, I think you’ll find. Get you. Let’s have a look. Remember, the surnames form something from that category. Zoff, Zoff. Kris Commons on the right-hand side. Commons. Do you know? I know exactly who that is and I can’t think of his name. He’s a long jumper. Zoff. So, it will be their surnames? Commons. Zoff, Commons. House of Commons. It’s House of Commons. Howe Zoff Commons. ",,

Overcoming weekly challenges and the scrutiny of the judges... It looks dull. Let that confidence out. ..to be crowned Best British Amateur Artist of 2015. Time is up. Officials failed to stop three London girls - thought to be trying tojoin Islamic State - from leaving the UK - according to the family of anotherjihadi bride. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase, Shamima Begum flew to Turkey 5 days ago - there is still no news of their whereabouts. The veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell sparks a row after telling a Sunday newspaper a ""raving alcoholic sex paedophile"" could be elected in Great Grimsby. And the final preparations in Hollywood ahead of the biggest night of the year for the movie industry. The family of a female jihadist - who may have encouraged three London girls tojoin so-called Islamic State - say officials ""failed"" to stop them leaving the UK. Aqsa Mahmood, who went to Syria to be a ""jihadi bride"" in 2013, is reported to have had online contact with one of the girls who flew to Turkey last week. There is still no news of the three school girls - Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase - who are thought to be trying to cross the border into Syria to join the extremists. Our World Affairs correspondent, Caroline Hawley, has more. It is five days since the girls left home. Their families have all appealed to them to return, but so far, there’s been no word from them. They were all friends from the same school, described as Grade A students and all three were questioned by police in December after another of their school friends we nt after another of their school friends went to Syria. At least one of the three had been in touch on Twitter with this young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left Scotland for Syria and married an IS fighter. She’s been active in recruiting other young women to follow in her footsteps. The idea now that a young 15-year-old should make contact with Aqsa, who is regarded as a terrorist, a member of ISIS, yet no action is taken, the family of that young girl do not have the customary knock on the front door, or the fact that these three girls managed to reach an airport and the common-sense approach of Special Branch, UK Border Agency, common-sense approach of Special Branch, UK BorderAgency, don’t notice the fact that two 15-year-olds, 16-year-old, unaccompanied, going on a flight to Turkey, the staging post to Syria, which is what Aqsa did, and they aren’t stopped. The girls were picked up on CCTV at Gatwick Airport. The Home Office says it is UP Airport. The Home Office says it is up to the airlines to check the passports of those leaving the country. Then, there is the question of whether their communications should have been more closely monitored. There’s been a lot of criticism of the Government doing too much surveillance and it’s been difficult to get agreement on powers to update the Government’s powers, to intercept communications, so bear that in mind. This can be an example of why it is necessary. There is growing concern that young Muslim women are being groomed by IS militants. These three girls are following in the footsteps of 50 to 60 other young British girls and women who have left to UK to join ISIS. ISIS have a very strong, aggressive online social media campaign which is targeting girls. We know they flew into Istanbul on Tuesday. What we don’t know is whether they have travelled on to the Turkish border and managed to cross into IS territory. The veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell has provoked a row over comments he’s reported to have made about his Great Grimsby seat. A Sunday newspaper claimed he’d said Labour would hold it at the next election even if it had chosen a ""raving alcoholic sex paedophile"". Our Political correspondent, Matthew Cole, reports. In parts of Northern England, in seats like Great Grimsby, Labour is facing a threat from Ukip, so comments by the outgoing Labour MP that his replacement would win the seat even if the party had picked a raving alcoholic sex paedophile as a candidate are mistimed. If it was said, it was said as a joke, like I’ll vote for a pig if my party puts one up. I don’t feel that because I have enormous respect for the electorate and we have to win their support back. It’s a golden rule not to take voters for granted so this could be damaging. Ukip says it is a shot in the arm for its cause. He is making a cynical comment about the electoral system. He is saying anybody could win for Labour in Great Grimsby. I’m not so sure about that. There is a serious challenge from Ukip there. Labour is rubbishing claims that Austin Mitchell, a committed Euro-sceptic, is trying to sabotage his own replacement in favour of Ukip. It is how the voters of Grimsby respond that matters and we will have to wait until May 7th for that. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, has said he wants to introduce a new crime to catch companies which assist or fail to stop tax evasion. If the measure, which would be known as ""corporate failure to avoid preventing an economic crime"", can’t be introduced before the General Election, Mr Alexander told The Andrew Marr Show that it would be included in the Liberal Democrat manifesto. More than 1,000 people, predominantly Muslim and jewish, joined in a demonstration of solidarity in Oslo last night. They formed a protective ring around a synagogue in the Norwegian capital in the wake of last week’s Islamist shootings in Denmark. Two people died when a cafe and a synagogue in Copenhagen were attacked by a gunman, who was then shot dead by police. A Russian general involved in implementing the cease-fire in eastern Ukraine says rebel forces will today begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line. Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists have already exchanged nearly 200 prisoners, as Paul Adams reports from Donetsk. Hobbling out of the darkness, dozens of captured Ukrainian soldiers now on their way home, the first prisoner swap since a cease-fire agreement was reached ten days ago. There should be more, but no-one knows how many captives the two sides hold. Once last harangue before they leave, ""This is our territory,"" the rebel tells them, throwing in a little recent history to drive the point home. Late last night, another possible sign of progress. A senior Russian general, sent by Moscow to coordinate between Kiev and the rebels, saying the withdrawal of heavy weapons can now begin. TRANSLATION: I can confirm and certify that all sides have very effectively worked on this plan, both Ukraine and Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republic. It all looks good on the map, but it’s events on the ground that count. International monitors say they’re still waiting for details. At the end of a week which has seen the government experience its most humiliating defeat in months, the exchange of prisoners and the apparent willingness of the rebels to withdraw their heavy weapons do represent glimmers of hope that the agreement reached in Minsk ten days ago could yet be made to stick. But the rebels say it’ll be two days before any of their heavy weapons actually move; plenty of time for things to go wrong. PaulAdams, BBC News, Donetsk. The votes have been cast and counted and tonight the winners of this year’s Academy Awards will revealed. It looks set to be a battle between two films - Birdman and Boyhood - while British hopes rest on the shoulders of actor Eddie Redmayne. From Hollywood, our Arts Editor, Will Gompertz, reports. There are award ceremonies and then there are the Oscars. They are big, they are brash, they are Tinseltown’s annual night out. This is the entrance through which all the Oscar hopefuls will emerge in a few hours’ time before walking up the red carpet, past banks and banks and banks of the world’s press before taking a right at the top, going into the Dolby Theater and finding out if 2015 is their year. What I reversed time to see what happened at the beginning of time itself? Eddie Redmayne is being tipped to win in the Leading Actor character for his performance playing Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. Co-star Felicityjones is a longer shot to win the Leading Actress Oscar, but things have already worked out for her. I’m so excited because my family are coming out and I haven’t seen them since the nominations, so I can’t wait to be celebrating it with them. That’s what I’m really looking forward to. She’s up against another British actress in the shape of Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike, in a category many expect to be won byjulianne Moore for playing a middle-aged woman with early onset Alzheimer’s in Still Alice. I have good days, bad days and on my bad days I feel like I can’t find myself. Keira Knightley is thought to have only an outside chance of winning her Supporting Actress category, while Benedict Cumberbatch appears unlikely to take the Leading Actor Oscar over his friend Eddie. Michael Keaton could usurp them both with his performance in Birdman, a film that Hollywood buzz suggests is going to be fighting it out with Boyhood for the Best Picture award. A movie in which Patricia Arquette’s performance as a hard-pressed single mother could see her winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. All will be revealed in a few hours’ time. Will Gompertz, BBC News, Hollywood. That’s it for now. The next news on BBC One is at 5.30pm. Goodbye. Hello. Most of our weather this week is coming from North America. We are seeing cold air digging out of Canada, a strong jet stream picking it up and that is driving it across the Atlantic towards us. It is turning wet and windy here. It is mostly rain. There is still some snow to come over the hills. Quickly, that should clear away from the western fringes of Scotland. There will be more snow across the Highlands. Sunshine and showers following on into Northern Ireland. It will feel cold. Further south, it is more likely to be rain. That wetter weather pushing into the South East late this afternoon. By then, the rain easing off in Wales and the South West, with temperatures getting into double figures here. It is notjust wet, it is also windy. Strong and gale force winds around the coast. That wet and windy weather will get swept away this evening. The skies will clear for a while. Close to this low pressure, we will see a lot of wintry showers. Temperatures low enough to bring the of some icy patches. So, setting up the week ahead - patches. So, setting up the week ahead - it is a windy week ahead. We will fluctuate between spells of milder, wetter weather to something colder with some sunshine and wintry showers. That is how we start the week, sunshine and wintry showers. The bulk of the sleet and snow falling in western Scotland. More fleeting wintry showers for England and Wales. Sunshine around as well. It will feel colder than the temperatures suggest, more like close to freezing. The winds stay pretty strong during tomorrow evening. We are more likely to get a dusting of snow at lower levels overnight and there will be further bands of sleet and snow and hail pushing in across the UK. Our low pressure is moving out on Tuesday towards northern parts of the North Sea. The wind direction is changing. Otherwise, it is sunshine and wintry showers. Probably fewer showers across Southern England and North East England should be dry. With those strong winds, it will feel colder than six or seven degrees. Then things change again around the middle part of the week. We will lose those north-westerly winds. This is our next area of low pressure, pushing to the north of the UK. Ahead of that, a touch of frost in the east. A dry start here. This rain not that heavy during the day. There will be little rain heading towards the eastern side of the UK. Temperatures will rise, possibly getting into double figures. It will be very brief. It will be wet across Scotland and Northern Ireland on Wednesday evening. This cold front pushes south-eastwards, the winds coming all the way from the north or north-west, so we will get back into the colder regime. We still have some rain to clear the South East on Thursday. Then it will get colder as the day goes on with some sunshine and wintry showers in those north-westerly winds. We end the week with low pressure to the north of us, a run of cold north-westerlies, signs of change again. So, Friday, cold air, sunshine and wintry showers. But milder air could come back in again during next weekend, howeverthe come back in again during next weekend, however the cold is never too far away. It is going to be a rollercoaster ride over the week ahead. We’ve seen everything the Blinds have to offer. Now, it’s the Battles. This week, on The Voice... BELL RINGS Two singers...

Let’s battle right now, what? There it is. Let’s get ready to rumble. Hello, I’m Mark Williams. Welcome to The Link where knowing the answers is only half the battle. To win this game you have to find the link between the answers. Three teams are hoping to make the right connections, but only one of them can be in today’s final. Let’s see who’s motivated to make their mark. I’m Hannah. I’m from Manchester and I work for a big cancer charity. This is my friend. I’m Anna. I live in Kent, and I am an auditor. APPLAUSE And the link is... as Hannah said, you’re friends. Anna, you’re a skier and a skiing instructor. Yes. And you work with blind skiers. Do you have to talk to them all the time? Yes, you have to be in contact constantly. So you’re skiing and trying to talk and trying to guide them? And normally skiing backwards. It’s quite scary for both parties, but it’s really liberating for the blind skier. It’s really enjoyable. Brilliant. Hannah and Anna, welcome. BOTH: Thank you. Andrew and Grant, tell us about yourselves. I’m Andrew, I’m from Oxford, and I’m a tutor in Geography and business. This is my son. I’m Grant. I’m also from Oxford. I work for a summer school. APPLAUSE And the link is, as Andrew pointed out rather proudly, father and son. So, did your dad ever teach you? Both my parents are teachers, so I have been taught by them both on more than one occasion. And it’s weird. Yes, some people, it’s their worst nightmare that their parent’s the teacher. ""Oh, no...!"" OK, Andrew, Grant, welcome. Linda and john, tell us about yourselves. I’m Linda, I’m from Wirral, I work for the NHS. This is my friend. I’m john. I’m a local government officer for Wirral. APPLAUSE And the link is, you’re friends. Is it true that you had baby daughters at the same time? BOTH: Yeah. We met in childbirth! That’s very bonding, though - when you’ve got tiny kids. Absolutely. Yeah. They were born within a couple of months of each other, so... And how old are they now? 16. Uh-oh! And what are their names? Phoebe and Freya. Aw...! Hello Phoebe. Hello, Freya. Linda and john, welcome. Welcome all. Now, pay attention. Here are six cash pods containing amounts ranging from £125-£2000. The more cash in the pod, the more links holding it. What you have to do is cut the links holding the pods until they drop into your bank. And here’s how you cut the link. I’m going to ask you four questions and you have to work out what links the answers. If you can find that link from the first answer alone, you’ll be able to cut four of those links. If you spot it after the second answer, you can cut three. Then two, then one... ..and, of course, the link here is... ALL: Cheese. ",,

An emotional plea from the families of the schoolgirls believed to have fled to Syria to join so-called Islamic State. We just wanted come Wejust wanted come home. If you are there, baby, please come home. We just want you home, we want you safe. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana flew to Turkey 5 days ago - there is still no news of their whereabouts. We’ll be asking why young British women appear to be attracted to the ideology of Islamic State. Also on the programme: The MP Austin Mitchell sparks controversy by saying that an alcoholic peadophile could win the Great Grimsby seat for Labour. What if I reverse time to see what happened at the beginning of time itself? Could it be Eddie Redmayne’s time tonight- as Britain fields a host of nominees at the Oscars. Good evening. The families of the three teenage girls believed to have left the UK tojoin Islamic State fighters in Syria - have appealed for them to return home. Nothing has been heard from Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase since they flew to Turkey five days ago. Today Amira’s father said he had no idea of her plans and that her last words to him were ‘Daddy, I’m in a hurry’. Daniel Sandford reports. The families of the three missing East London teenagers this afternoon taking a desperate appeal for them to come home. This is my niece, that is her favourite to come home. This is my niece, that is herfavourite niece. The sister clutching onto a photograph and the pyjamas of her 15-year-old sister Shamima Begum. She did not take anything with her, we are clinging on to the bits we have and we just want her to come home. If you watch this, baby, please come home. You are mum’s baby. Wejust want you home, we want you safe, just contact anybody, let them know you need help and you have got all the help in the world, you are not in any trouble here, we all love you, if anyone has convinced you of anything, they are wrong. We love you more than anybody could ever love you. One of Shamima 's best friends ran away in December and the family discussed it then. She told me what the family situation was, I thought OK. Out of conversation, at a young age she want to know what is going through your child’s mind, it made me ask, you would not do anything stupid like that, would you? She was also a big Chelsea fan, she loved Chelsea. This is the father of the second missing 15-year-old, Amira Abase. A huge Chelsea fan. This was the Teddy she get her mother for Mother’s Day. When she left home on Tuesday morning she told her family she was going to a wedding. Infact, she flew to Istanbul. The cheesy normal, wash and behave in a normal way? -- did she seem normal. No signs that she is strange. She was the same. Did she say goodbye in the normal way? The normal way. What she said is, daddy, Iam in a hurry. That is what she said. And before Tuesday, had she started showing an interest in Syria, while she talking a lot about it? Not at all, no, not at all, she was doing her schoolwork. The third missing girl is 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana. Everyone is hurting. We don’t know if you are safe, especially mum. Find the courage in your heart to contact us and let us know that you are safe and you are OK. Five days on, the last sign of the girls was at Gatwick Airport on Tuesday morning, and still no one knows if they have made it to their presumed destination, the self-styled Islamic state. Let’s go live now to the Turkey Syria border and our correspondent Selin Girit who’s on the Turkish side. Selin Today I travelled to a border crossing, which they suspect the three girls have used all my try to use in the next couple of days. It is just across the Islamic State health time. We saw no security, no police presence. The border gate is only open on Mondays and Thursdays, so if the girls did make their way into Syria in the last two days, it would mean an illegal border crossing. At the border gate we saw people who we have been told could be smugglers, but there was no sign of the three girls. The disappearance of the three girls has focused attention on the dozens of women thought to have left the UK to join Islamic State. Our World Affairs correspondent Caroline Hawley has been exploring why the group’s ideology is attracting some young British Muslims. These are some of the young women who have gone before. In all 50-60 British women and girls are thought to have left behind families and friends to travel out to the Middle East and join Islamic State. They include these twin teenage sisters from Manchester, who followed their brother to Syria and both married IS fighters. And this girl from Glasgow who also married a fighter. There is growing concern young women are being aggressively groomed on social media. But they are doing is promoting their propaganda, part of thatis promoting their propaganda, part of that is highlighting how it is a so-called religious obligation for young girls to leave the UK to join this Islamic State. They argue the West is at war with Islam, Muslims, you must leave this country and join Isis. What kind of life awaits them under IS? This is thought to show the twins from Manchester, though women are only supposed to fight in extreme circumstances. One month ago female IS supporters issued a manifesto on the role of women in the so-called caliphate. It says it is legitimate for a girl to be married at the age of nine, it describes staying at home with her husband and children as the fundamental function of a woman. Girls should be educated, it says, until the age of 15, mostly in religion as well as knitting and cooking. What is the appeal for young, western, Muslim women? Amid the guns, there is upon it deliver the promise of home comforts. -- there is a promise of. They are looking for a different way of life, they are very naive and have not lived that much and experienced different things, so when they are being sold the idea of a beautiful place to live with no troubles and worries, they seem to feel that is the place they want to be.

The veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell has provoked a row over comments he’s reported to have made about his Great Grimsby seat. A Sunday newspaper claimed he said Labour would hold the constituency at the next election even if it chose a "" raving alcoholic sex paedophile"" to fight it. Richard Thomas reports. Grimsby in North East Lincolnshire. The type of seats Labour should not be having to fight for. But here and in many northern constituencies, there is a huge threat from Ukip. So comments by the outgoing Labour MP that his replacement would win even if we selected eight raving alcoholic sex paedophile as a candidate have proved highly controversial. Today Austin Mitchell says he has been misquoted. If it was said it was set as a joke. That I would vote for a big if my party puts one up, which is what people used to say. I don’t feel that because I have enormous respect for the electorate, we have to win their support back. It is a golden rule in politics never detect voters for granted and these comments will provide ammunition for those who say the Labour Party is doing just that, notjust here, but in marginal constituencies across the country. He is making a very cynical comment about the electoral system in this country, saying anybody can win for Labour in great Grimsby. I am not sure about that, there is a serious challenge from Ukip. In Grimsby today voters were surprised about the comments from the MP for Ao years. I think it was meant in a different way and come out wrong. I think he might be right, I don’t think Ukip will get in here, it is a safe Labour seat. Iwon’t think Ukip will get in here, it is a safe Labour seat. I won’t be voting Labour. Infact, I probably will end UP Labour. Infact, I probably will end up voting for somebody like Ukip, I would imagine. Ultimately, it will be for the voters of great Grimsby to decide who they want as their MP. Injust overten to decide who they want as their MP. Injust over ten weeks to decide who they want as their MP. In just over ten weeks time, they will get that chance. Richard Thomas, BBC News, Grimsby. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, has said it should be a criminal offence for companies to assist or fail to stop tax evasion.

The former deputy PM will focus on trying to help a future Labour government seek agreement at climate talks due to take place in Paris in December Ukrainian forces say they plan to begin pulling back heavy weapons from the frontline in eastern Ukraine from today, in line with the terms of the peace plan brokered in Minsk. Russian-backed rebels say they will also pull back their weaponry. But fighting appears to be continuing, in violation of the ceasefire. Our correspondent, Paul Adams, reports from Donetsk. A rally for unity. Thrown into chaos by a single lethal explosion. Authorities in the second city in Ukraine call this an act of terrorism, which left at least two people dead, this was one of several rallies held all over the country to mark a year since the fall of Ukraine’s previous pro-Russian president. Further south near the recent government defeat in Debaltseve, Russian armoury on the move, this is not yet the withdrawal of heavy guns, the two side say that process can now start. For months the guns and rockets have rained down on places like Donetsk, neighbourhood close to the airport now practically deserted. The hardy few who remain have heard the news and do not believe it. TRANSLATION: Of course not, it will continue like in previous times, it is not the first Minsk agreement, the last time they said they would withdraw military vehicles and then told us no equipment to move them. When I was last in this area in September, it wasjust after the was last in this area in September, it was just after the last ceasefire had come into effect. This area had not been shelved for that long. Since then it has been absolutely relentless and you can see the evidence of it all around. Even unexploded weaponry lying in the middle of the road. People who live in this part of Donetsk are sceptical about all talk of withdrawing heavy weapons. And so our international monitors, they want to know where the weapons are, how they will be moved and where they will be stored. The process is yet to start.

The finishing touches are being put to the event, it is on a mind-boggling scale, think of a wedding reception, times it by several thousand, double the figure, you get a sense of what the Oscars are, there are thousands of people who have been working putting the red carpet together for the last few days. Every parking lot in the Trinity is filled with TV crews to put together a show which is a bit even by Hollywood standards. The question is, will it have a happy ending for the British contingent? What if I reverse time? To see what happened at the beginning of time itself. Eddie Redmayne is being tipped to win in the leading actor category for his performance playing Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. His co-star Felicityjones is a longer shot to win the leading actress Oscar, but things seem to have worked out for her already. I am so excited because my family are coming out. And I have not seen them since denomination, sol out. And I have not seen them since denomination, so I can’t wait to be celebrating it with them, that is what I am really looking forward to. She is up against another British actress in the shape of Rosamund Pike of Gone Girl, in a category many expect to be won byjulianne Moore, playing a middle-aged woman with early onset Alzheimer’s in still Alice. They have good days and bad days, my bad days I feel like I can’t find myself. Keira Knightley is thought to only have an outside chance of winning her supporting actress category, while her co-star Benedict Cumberbatch appears unlikely to take the leading actor Oscar over his friend, Eddie. But Michael Keating could usurp them both with his performance in Birdman. A film that Hollywood buzz suggests is going to be fighting it out with the coming-of-age movie Boyhood for the best picture award. A movie in which Patricia Arquette’s performance as a hard-pressed single mother could see her winning the Best supporting actress Oscar. All will be revealed in a few hours time. It really will, in a few hours, all of the Oscar hopefuls will enter through a door down the red carpet. Golden, of course. Walk up the carpet past banks and banks of the worlds press. Of cameras here. I go past my spot, into the Dolby theatre to my right, take their seats among three and a half thousand other people and find out if 2015 is going to be their year. Enjoy the night.

The families ofthe three London schoolgirls believed to be heading for Syria make an emotional plea With no news of the teenagers for the last five days, they appeal for their safe return. Please come home. Mum needs you. You are her baby. We want you home. We want you are her baby. We want you home. We wa nt you safe. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana and are thought to be attracted to joining Islamic State. We’ll be asking why. The Labour MP Austin Mitchell under fire for reported comments suggesting Labour would hold his Grimsby seat even with a paedophile as a candidate. ~ I think it is classing the mentality of the Grimsby people. To me it is wrong. We all have a vote and a say and we all have minds of our own. Could it be Eddie Redmayne’s time tonight - as Britain fields a host of nominees at the Oscars? Good evening. The families of the three London teenagers believed to be heading to Syria to join Islamic State have made emotional appeals for the girls to come home. Nothing has been heard of Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abbas since they flew to Turkey last Tuesday. All three have been described as star pupils, due to take their GCSEs in the summer. Today their families said they had no idea of their plans and called for them to come home. Daniel Sandford reports. The families of the three missing teenagers making a desperate appeal for them to come home. She is our baby. Renu, Begum clutching photographs of her 15-year-old sister, and her pyjamas. She didn’t take anything with her. We are kind of clinging on to the bits that we have. We want her to come home. If you watch this, baby, please come home. Mum needs you more than anything in the world. We want you home, we want you safe. When asked about people who encouraged teenage girls who travel to Syria, the tears turn to anger. To convince such young girls at that age that are so vulnerable and are so... It’s just wrong. It’s evil. It’s a really evil thing to do. She was also a Chelsea fan. She loved Chelsea very much. The father of Amira Abase, also 15, today clutching the teddy she had given her mother for Mother’s Day. When she left home on Tuesday, she said she was going to a wedding. In fact she flew to Istanbul, heading, the police thing, for the self-styled Islamic state in Syria. REPORTER: Did she seem normal and was she in a normal way? Absolutely normal. Before Tuesday, had she started showing an interest in Syria, was she talking a lot about the problems? Not at all. She was doing her schoolwork because she’s taking her GCSEs this year. There is no sign to suspect her at all. The British Ethiopian had this simple, mrantive message for his daughter-- plaintiff message. We miss you. We cannot stop crying, please, think twice. A message echoed by the family of Kadiza Sultana, the third missing girl. Everyone is hurting. We don’t know if you are safe, especially mum. Find the courage in your heart to contact us and let us know that you are safe and you are OK. And, still, more than five days after the girls flew out of Gatwick for Turkey, after the girls flew out of Gatwick forTurkey, no-one for Turkey, no-one knows if they’ve crossed the border into the war and horror of Syria. The disappearance of the three girls has focused attention on why some young British Muslims - including women - have felt attracted to the ideology of Islamic State. Our World Affairs Correspondent, Caroline Hawley, reports. These are some of the young girls who have gone before. 50 to 60 British women and girls had thought to have left behind families and friends to Taff to join the Islamic state. They include these twin sisters from Manchester who followed their brothers to Syria and married fighters. And this girl from Glasgow, who also married a fighter and who is accused of grooming girls and women from jihad. We know that Shamima Begum tried to get in testify with her. Their propaganda promising excitement, adventure. This is thought to come from the twins in Manchester. This is believed to be another British woman. In reality women are only actually fighting in extreme circumstances. A month ago, supporters issues a manifesto in Arabic in the role of women in the so-called caliphate. It said it is legitimate for a girl to be married at the age of nine. It describes staying at home with her husband and children as the fundamental function of a woman. Girls’ education until the age of 15 should focus on faith and home-making skills. So, what’s the appeal for young, Western Muslim women? Amid the guns, there is a promise of home comforts. This woman works with mothers worried about their daughters being radicalised. These are girls who are battling with their identity in the UK, asking themselves questions in the sense of - are asking themselves questions in the sense of- are we British or are we Muslim? Not understanding that actually they can both go hand in hand but for them it is a conflict. So they are attracted to this one community, over in Syria, to bear the children of the Islamic state and to increase them, so to speak. We don’t know what motivated these three friends to leave home or tonight where they are and whether they have nowjoined IS. Live now to Daniel Sandford outside Scotland Yard. What are the police saying tonight, Daniel, about where the girls might be? Well, in simple terms, they have no idea. They are getting good cooperation from the Turkish authority. There are Metropolitan Police detectives on the ground in Turkey but they simply don’t know what happened to those girls once they had arrived in Istanbul and they simply don’t know whether they are managed to cross the border into those bits of Syria controlled by Islamic state. There are a couple of concerns tonight in the security establishment, amid all the investigation and one is that perhaps they hadn’t been paying enough attention to the issue of young girls trying to go out to join Islamic state. There is focus understandably on young men, because of the fear they might come back and cause problems here but perhaps they had taken their eye off the ball on theissue had taken their eye off the ball on the issue of young women. There is also focus on Turkish Airlines, I should say, a feeling that that airline in particular, hasn’t done as much as other carriers in terms of notifying detectives and the police when unusual people are making the journey out to Turkey, the kind of people that might be going on to try to get into Syria. Thank you, Daniel. The veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell has provoked a row over comments he’s reported to have made about his Great Grimsby seat. A Sunday newspaper claimed he said Labour would hold the constituency at the next election even if it chose a "" raving alcoholic sex paedophile"" to fight it. Robin Brant reports. The people of Grimsby have voted in one direction for decades. Labour’s Austin Mitchell is about to stand down as the MP after almost Ao years in the job. But he’s not worried about his successor. He told the Independent on Sunday that Labour would win ""Even if we selected a raving alcohol sex paedophile as the candidate."" He has since dismissed the story but also said he didn’t mean to cause offence. If it was said it was said as a joke like - mean to cause offence. If it was said it was said as a joke like - I will vote for a pig if my party puts one up, which is what someone used to stay. I do not feel that. I have enormous respect for the electorate. So, would Grimsby vote for anyone as long as they were Labour? I think he might be right. I don’t think Ukip will get in here. I think it is a safe Labour seat. I think he is classing the mentality of Grimsby people, which to me is wrong. We all have a vote and a say and we all have minds of our own. Ukip is pushing hard to take seats off Labour in its northern heartland. This was Greater Manchester last October where they almost did it. The party leader thinks Austin Mitchell’s seat could be next. He is making a very cynical comment about the electoral system in this country. He is saying anybody could win for Labour in Great Grimsby I’m in the so sure about that. There was a serious challenge there from Ukip. The reality is that most of the 650 constituencies in Parliament are safe seats. The same party usually wins them. Less than one-third arer considered marginal, and fewer than one in ten have changed sides in the majority of elections since 1950. I This is the heart of another very safe seat for Labour. It has been red on and off for more than 75 years. Islington North also happens to be the home of Arsenal Football Club. The coming election is going to be tight and getting your supporters out, even the most loyal, will be crucial for the political party. Grimsby will decide on May 7th, but even here, any hint of complacency won’t be welcome. And Robin is with me now in the studio. Because, we have a rather different political story breaking. News tonight of serious allegations against two former Foreign Secretaries for the Conservatives, Malcolm Rifkind, on the Labour side, jack Straw. Channel 1+ and the Daily Telegraph is reporting they were involved effectively in a sting operation where they were filmed being approached bial fictitious Chinese company and being asked to effectively lobby on behalf of that company in exchange for money. -- effectively lobby on behalf of that company in exchange for money. -- by a fictitious. We don’t know much more about the finer details of the allegations. I understand tonight that jack Straw will be referring himself to the parliamentary Commissionerfor himself to the parliamentary Commissioner for standards and could now be suspended from the Parliament Labour Party until a full inquiry is carried out. Malcolm Rifkind, I have spoken to him in the last few minutes, he has told me he would have been happy to mention these things, that he’s filmed saying in this sting in be a Channel 1+ interview. Nothing he sought to get wag secret information. But hees Threes serious allegations particularly about him, because he chairs the security and Intelligence Committee. Thank you very much. A bomb blast in eastern Ukraine has killed two people on the first anniversary of the removal of the former president from power. Both Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels say they will honour a ceasefire agreement and pull heavy weaponry back from the front line - but for the moment, fighting appears to be continuing. Our correspondent, Paul Adams, reports from Donetsk. A rally for unity - thrown into chaos by a single, lehtal explosion. ~ -- lethal explosion. The authorities here, in Ukraine’s second largest city, called this an act of terrorism that left at least two people dead. This was one of several rallies held all over the country to mark a year since the fall of Ukraine’s previous pro-Russian president. Further south, near the scene of the government’s recent defeat at Debaltseve, Ukrainian armour on the move. This is not yet the withdrawal of heavy guns. The two sides do now say that process can start. For months the guns and rockets have rained down on places like Donetsk, neighbourhoods close to the airport, now practically deserted. The hardy few who remain have heard the news but they don’t believe it. TRANSLATION: Of course not. It will continue like in previous times. It’s not the first Minsk agreement. The last time they said they would withdrawal military vehicles but then they hold us they have no equipment to move them. When I was last here, in September, it was just after the last ceasefire and this area close to the airport hadn’t been shelled for that long. Since then, it’s been absolutely relentless. You can see the evidence all around in this unexploded weaponry lying in the middle of the road. Hardly surprising people who live here doubt that weapons will be withdrawn. International monitors are sceptical, too. They want to know where the weapons are, how they’ll be moved and where they’ll be stored. The process has yet to start. The Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, has said he’d like to introduce a new criminal offence that would hold companies accountable for failing to prevent tax evasion. The comments come in the wake of the HSBC private bank allegations. Our business correspondent, joe Lynam, reports. The accusations have been swirling around HSBC for the past fortnight. Now banks and accountants could be made responsible if they do nothing while their clients knowingly evade tax. just like someone who helps a pick-pocket pick your pocket is committing a crime, so someone who is facilitating evasion also should be doing the same. So I’m proposing today that we should create a new offence of corporate failure to avoid preventing an economic crime, and also that organisations who facilitate evasion or who encourage evasion, should face the same level of financial penalty as the evaders themselves. The Chief Secretary wants to make it a crime if professional advisors such as banks and consultants look the other way while their clients commit an economic crime, such as tax evasion. In practice he wants to extend the responsibility firms already have for health and safety issues, for example, to financial matters. And the proposals could see advisors fined just as much for not reporting suspected tax evasion, as the evaders themselves. But one of the biggest tax advisors in the world. PWC, said in a statement tonight: Although it might be tough to get his proposals on the statute books before May, Danny Alexander says it’ll be a priority for the Liberal Democrats. Labour says the coalition has totally failed to tackle the issue of tax avoidance, which still hangs as a cloud over the City of London. The movie industry’s biggest night of the year is a upon us - the 87th Academy Awards are about to get under way with a striking number of British nominees this year. Let’s join our Arts Editor Will Gompertz on the red carpet. Hello. The excitement has gone up a notch or two. This whole area has been locked down. The Red Carpet is now open which means the Oscar hopefuls will start making their way from behind the golden curtain, up the red carpet, past the massive press pack up to the theatre, take a right, go in there and take seats among 3,500 people and hope that 2015 is their lucky year.

His costar Felicityjones is also up as is Rosamund Pike in a category many expect to be won byjulie Ann Moore. ~ I have good days. On bad days I feel I can’t find myself. Keira Knightley is thought to have only an outside chance of winning her category. Her costar, Benedict Cumberbatch appears unlikely to take the leading actor Oscar over his friend, Eddie but Michael Keaton could usurp them both with his performance in Birdman, a film, that that Hollywood suggests will be fighting it out with Boyhood for Best picture, a movie in which Patricia oar coat ears performance as a hard-pressed single mother could see her winning the Best actress Oscar. -- could see her winning the Best actress Oscar. -- Patricia Arquette. It certainly will be revealed. The buzz on the red carpet is very much that Eddie Redmayne could well win that Oscar tonight for Best actor. Now, if he was to do that, would he go from being a respected, emerging young character actor into a genuine Hollywood A-Lister.

After a period of unprecedented success, they failed to win a single gold medal in Paris, as David Ornstein reports. Over the past decade, track cycling has become Britain’s most successful Olympic sport. But the World Championships in Paris suggest the golden era could be over. Britain went into the final day with only two silver medals. It left hopes resting with Laura Trott but she finished second meaning Britain failed to win a gold for the fist time since 2001. I think we have definitely moved forward since last year. Obviously we won a gold and we haven’t this year. I think you will see within the times that we have come on. I think, slowly but surely we will get there. Much has changed for the track team since London 2012. Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton has retired while mastermind Sir Dave Brailsford is foe cousin on the road. Seeing double Olympic champion, jason Kenny struggle will come as a shock. Is this elite sport’s evolutionly cycle? We raised the bar in this sport. It is difficult to surpass that. It is never going to go on forever. We accept that. Cycling has become crucial to Britain’s Olympic medal prospects. They’ll hope to turn the silvers into gold next year in Rio.

It is good news for Annie Woodland an her family but every day of the last 15 years has been a about thele. Her brain injury has left her with memory loss and mood swings. She’ll need care for life. She nearly drowned in Swailing lesson in 2000 when she was a pewee at a junior school in Basildon. -- when she was a pupil. It was herfavourite day when she was going. Then I saw her, with defibrillators and shocks. I didn’t know if she would make it or not. I didn’t want her to go without her brothers seeing her. Annie is expected to receive a seven-figure settlement now that the Supreme Court has overturned an earlier judgment and ruled that Essex County Council was liable for the negligence of a subcontract o. That’s despite the fact that the swimming instructor and lifeguard who failed to spot she was in trouble were not employed by the council. It isjustice but trouble were not employed by the council. It is justice but far too late and too long and caused extra damage for Annie. I don’t think any family should have to go through it. This may help other families in future. I’m always going to struggle but hopefully I’ll have the financial security to, you know, be happy and look after my little boy. Essex County Council hasn’t commented on the case. The exact sum of Annie’s payout will be assessed at a later date. Now the weather. . Today’s rain is clearing away as we go through the night tonight.

After a soggy Sunday, the good news is that tomorrow is looking better. We will certainly get more sunshine but you still have to be prepared for wintry showers, especially in the north of the country and it is going to be windy. The bad weather was brought by this area of low pressure. It’ll stick around for a couple of days. Even on Tuesday we’ll feel the effects of this big area of low pressure. This is the rain-bearing cloud we had during today. That persistent rain. It is out of the way now. What was left over in its wake is a scattering of showers. Some wintry particularly across the hills in Scotland and Northern Ireland where it will be fairly cold. Around freezing tonight orjust above to the south of that. Not quite so cold. Tomorrow, most of the wintry showers over the hills and windy conditions will be in the north-west. I wouldn’t be surprised if in one or two other places we may get some hail or a crack of thunder. Many areas, I would like to stress tomorrow, will have sunshine. It is not going to be the grey, overcast, horrible day many experienced he o today. That low is still around to the north-east of us on Tuesday. It will still be a windy day, particularly in the morning. Then the wind will tend to ease later in the afternoon. One or two showers around. Ithink the afternoon. One or two showers around. I think predominantly on Tuesday, we are talking about mostly dry weather with highs of around about six or seven.

127,BBC1 London,19-feb-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,40 mins,True,"A big fall in profits for the owners of British Gas - a drop of 35% last year. The Chief Executive says investment will be cut, after a particularly difficult year. Falling oil and gasp prices which impacted the North Sea, we had compressed power margins in the UK and we had unusual weather patterns, including the warmest weather on record in the UK. We’ll be asking what it means for the company, and for customers. Also this lunchtime. No sign of a ceasefire - heavy shelling continues around the main rebel city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. The NHS in England spends too much money on new drugs - to the detriment of other treatments, say researchers. In the last few minutes, Germany has rejected a new proposal from Greece for a loan extension. A fossil left in a cupboard for 30 years - and thought to be a plaster copy - turns out to be a new species of ancient reptile. Later on BBC London: Commuters bombard rail companies with nearly 500,000 messages on Twitter to complain about delays and overcrowding. And Alina will be here with a full weather forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Centrica, which owns British Gas, has reported a big drop in profits. They fell by 35% last year to £1.75 billion - because of the falling price of oil and the warm weather. As a result, the company says it’s cutting its payout to share holders, and will reduce investment in its North Sea operations by 40%. Simon Gompertz reports. The giant energy company, attacked for its profits, now finds they are slipping away. The sharp fall in the oil price hit games in oil and gas production. North Sea investment will now be cut by 40%. Then there was last year’s golden autumn, warmer weather route using sales by British Gas, which is part of Centrica. Within the 35% fall in profits to £1.75 billion was a 23% drop in profits from households to 439 million, along with an announcement that two power stations would be closed. In the UK producing power doesn’t deliver good profits, and in fact many of our power stations are currently running at a loss. We need to make sure that the market is structured so that investment is incentivised, because Britain must have enough power in order to keep the lights on and make sure that our economy can operate. For the 650,000 small investors. The saids who bought in during the privatisation of the energy industry, the result is a 30% cut in the regular income they get from their shares, their dividend. Oh dear. But customers like Pamela don’t have much sympathy for Centrica’s flight. She complains the 5% price cut passed on to gas users doesn’t apply until the end of February when the cold months are nearly over. I think it’s pretty awful really. Because, everybody wants cheaper gas, particularly over the winter time when you are needing so much more gas for your heating. Energy companies have been accused of limiting reductions, partly because of Labour’s Promes to cap energy prices. -- because of Labour’s Promes to cap energy prices. -- promise. The price cap had no impact on our decision-making. We don’t accept prices for political reasons. We set prices to win customers and retain them. Infact, our margins last year were the lowest we have seen in the last six years. Last autumn a lot of families delayed turning on the heating for weeks or even longer, with the result that the average household paid £1152 for their energy, and the average profit was £42 per household, that is £10 less for British Gas. The bloke to profits has cost Centrica dear but it’s something the company will use in its defence against people who think they are being overcharged -- the blow to profits. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, is with me. Iain Conn talked about what sounds like a pretty big cut in investment. How significant is it? It’s not easy being an energy company at the moment, BP said it has problems, SheU moment, BP said it has problems, Shell and now Centrica. I was tweeted this morning saying let me get the smallest violin possible to play the lament, who cares? But it does matter. Because investment means how much energy supply we will get in the future. And as Simon said in his report they will cut investment in the North Sea, for example, by 40%. They are going to close two of their eight gas-fired power stations, which means will there be enough energy supply in the future? Ian Conway made it clear, no turning off the lights at the moment but in the future there might be problems. Centrica is a very big employer. This is aboutjobs. Again Iain Conn said no decision onjobs yet but in the future if you are becoming a smaller company it may have an impact on jobs. What about the rest of us? Shareholders and customers, of course. And as Simon said in his report thousands of individuals rely on income from British as through the dividend and pension funds get profits from Centrica’s profits, so that’s important for pensioners as well and those saving for their pensions. Finally on bills, any more downward pressure on bills? I think it was clearfrom pressure on bills? I think it was clear from today’s announcement on profit falls that what cuts we have seen are all we are going to see for the moment. Thank you for now, Kamal Ahmed. All morning there’s been heavy shelling around the main rebel city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. It had been hoped that the fall of the strategic town of Debaltseve yesterday might allow the fragile ceasefire to take hold - but so far there seems no end to the fighting. Here, the Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, has warned that Russia could use the conflict with Ukraine to destabilise the Baltic states - which are part of Nato. Nick Childs reports. A moment to savour for pro-Russian rebels, belong crucial battle for the key of Debaltseve is over and they’ve won, but what now after this battle? Will the fighting finally quiet down and the ceasefire, partial at best, really take hold? Or will the two sidesjust regrouped to renew the conflict? Here are the Moody’s of relief, these are Ukrainian government troops, just happy to be alive after a grim siege of Debaltseve and Dave Parris pull out. This soldier talks of a shoot out at a separatist checkpoint as they tried to withdraw. As everyone takes stock of the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have spoken by phone. They have announced violations of the truce and say it must be fully fermented now. The Ukrainian President has insisted that withdrawal was organised but no doubt new pressure over the fact and manner of pull out he’s come out with a new proposal-- implemented. TRANSLATION: Iwant he’s come out with a new proposal-- implemented. TRANSLATION: I want to raise the question of inviting a peace process that will work to the mandate of the UN Security Council. From the heartland of the pro-Russian rebellion in Donetsk deputy defence minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic says they are not against the idea of peacekeepers amid reports of new shelling around the city and new expressions of concern about the potential of the wider fallout from this conflict. The Defence Secretary has said he’s worried Russian President Vladimir Putin, about his pressure on the Baltics and the way he’s testing Nato. He talked of a real and present danger. He could use the tactics employed in Crimea to destabilise the Baltic republics, all now Nato members. Amid worsening relations a Royal Navy frigate shadowed a Russian destroyer in the English Channel this week and there is new word of RAF fighters shadowing Russian bombers off the coast, AS Moscow denounced Mr Fallon’s comments. Nato has been bolstering its presence in the Baltic states to reassure them as the Alliance tries to get to grips with what kind of relationship it can have with Moscow now. And in Ukraine this was always going to be a fragile, uncertain ceasefire at best. After Debaltseve its prospects remain as clear as ever. Nick Childs, BBC News. Let’s get more now on those comments by the Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, about what he called the ""real and present danger"" posed by Russia. We can speak to our political correspondent, Iain Watson. Tell us more about government reaction and David Cameron. We are on the verge of a major diplomatic row with Russia. David Cameron, the Prime Minister, has tried to calm things down over the past hour. We heard in the report about the incident were two Russian bombers were seen off the coast of Cornwall and escorted away by the RAF yesterday. David Cameron said the Russians are trying to make some kind of point but I don’t think we should dignify it with too much of a response. That tone was in stark contrast to Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary’s tone, who talked about a real and present danger from Russia to the Baltic states. The reason his comments were so important is that the Baltic states, unlike Ukraine, are members of Nato, the treaty makes it clear that an attack on one is an attack on all. That was ratcheting up the pressure severely from this side. The Russians have responded, the Russian foreign ministry said these comments were unacceptable and that Russia would respond. Michael Fallon’s comments went beyond what they cold diplomatic ethics. All of that needs to be defused. In the midst of this the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he didn’t see any evidence that Russia had designs on the Baltic states that he said we have to be vigilant and the backdrop to this is Britain is going to contribute 1000 troops to the rapid reaction Force and the Nato rapid reaction force, based effectively on the borders of Russia in Eastern Europe. From May there will be a small mother of RAF F-15 fighter jets based there will be a small mother of RAF F-15fighterjets based in Estonia. But fundamentally the message from the government here is that it is the continuation of the sanctions regime against Russia that they think will change its behaviour and they will not offer any lethal assistance, any military couldn’t that could be used in combat to the Ukraine, which is under huge pressure because of the Apache ceasefire. Sanctions rather than military action at the moment but the rhetoric has been ramped up and it would be good to see a diplomatic war of words, if not any actual conflict between the West and Russia. Thank you for now, Iain Watson. The health service in England is paying too much for new medicines - and other treatments are suffering as a result, according to researchers at York University. They are particularly critical of the special cancer drugs fund, which they’ve described as poor value. But Nice, the body which advises the NHS on drugs, says lowering prices could mean closing the door to new therapies. Here’s our health correspondent, Adam Brimelow. When it’s working out whether to recommend a drug for the health service in England and Wales, Nice looks at the cost alongside how much someone’s life is extended or improved. Treatments are compared in terms of quality-adjusted life years, or their ability to deliver a year of healthy life. Generally, the upper limit for the NHS is £20,000-30,000 for a year of good-quality life. New research says that is too high. It proposes a new limit of £13,000. Any more than that, it says, and the benefits are outweighed by the harm to other patients who miss out on more cost-effective treatment. They say the Cancer Drugs Fund, a separate pot of money for expensive new treatments, is particularly damaging and should be scrapped. This is about striking the right balance between encouraging the development of new medicines, making them available through the NHS, and protecting proven treatments. The researchers say the health service is getting that balance wrong. They argue the people who lose out under this approach include patients with breathing and circulation problems. If what we care about is overall health, that everybody is treated equally in that respect, then we need to make sure that when we approve a new drug for use that the benefits we get at least exceed the health that we are going to have to give up for other NHS patients. Nice has welcomed the report but is doubtful about how those savings could be made. For that to happen you’ve got to assume that the companies that manufacture new drugs and other treatments would be prepared to drop their prices to a level that is completely unprecedented. So it’s a heck of a risk to take. The pharmaceutical industry says it’s already doing a lot to curb the cost of new medicines for the NHS. It says if prices were cut as proposed in this report are many as proposed in this report many vital services, including maternity, A&E, and palliative care for dying patients would no longer be viable. Adam Brimelow, BBC News. Greece has formally asked for a six month extension to its loan agreement with the Eurozone. Finance ministers will consider the application at a special meeting tomorrow - but Germany has already rejected the proposal. Our correspondent, Mark Lowen, is in Athens. It is quite a swift response from Germany. Is there a surprise from where you are? I think there is surprise because the Greek proposal was hammered out after hours of discussions between apples and Brussels. The Greek proposal was the loan should be extended and it would not take any unilateral action to jeopardise financial stability and would agree to supervision by the ECB, which it had campaigned against before this latest election. That prompted the Eurozone finance ministers to call a meeting in Brussels to borrow which it had been thought would rubber-stamp the agreement. But in the last hour the German Government has already rejected it, saying it was not a substantial proposal and would not fulfilled the requirements of the bailout. That suggests there is a rift between Brussels and Berlin at the very highest level. It is not clear which side will prevail, but the hopes that Greece was moving towards a deal to pull it back at the 11th hour from a towards a deal to pull it back at the 11th hourfrom a bring the 11th hour from a bring and to avoid a default, those hopes have been thrown into doubt once again. Our top story this lunchtime: There’s been a big fall in profits for the owners of British Gas - they went down 35% last year And still to come: a happy lunar new year- millions around the world celebrate the Year of the Sheep. Coming up in sport at 1:30pm: Luis Figo has launched his manifesto for the FIFA presidency. The former portugal international is proposing an increase in the number of teams at the World Cup and more money for grassroots football. Police in Nottinghamshire say their investigation into alleged historical abuse at children’s homes now involves more than 150 potential suspects. Detectives are investigating claims of abuse at 13 children’s homes over a 40 year period. Meanwhile, a former social worker has told the BBC that allegations of abuse in the past were not properly investigated. Here’s Tom Bateman. Beechwood Remand Home saw thousands of children pass through its doors from the 1960s onwards. It should have been a safe haven for them. Now it is the focus of a growing number of complaints about abuse, extending well beyond this one institution. Police and Council officials are now looking into criminal allegations of physical and sexual abuse from more than 100 people, spanning 13 children’s homes in Nottinghamshire over four decades. The police, as they would put it, are on the case. They have had separate police forces come in to look at their investigation. If you are saying to me, things maybe went wrong in the past, having listened to the victims, I think they are probably right. Much of what went on behind the now boarded-up doors here at Beechwood has been lost to history. The two local Councils that ran homes in this area are promising a full inquiry. But the claims have been growing louder, that police and officials were told about allegations of abuse at the time, but failed to respond. A former social worker, who worked in Nottinghamshire during the 1990s, says sexual abuse was suspected in homes, but police did not believe children. My professional opinion is that they viewed them as worthless. They couldn’t be trusted. The fact that the police might be aware of certain children, because of their criminal behaviour would negate them being believed for anything else. The Nottinghamshire force have arrested 11 people and say they are determined to ensure a thorough investigation. Figures released this morning show how much money the major political parties received in donations in the last three month of 2014. Let’s get the details from our political correspondent, Ross Hawkins. What do the figures show? They confirm a lot of what you might expect, the Conservatives getting about £10 million more than Labour. Labour heavily rely on trade union funds, Ukip doing better than they have in the past. Despite all the woes of the Liberal Democrats they have had their best year for fundraising and inevitably controversy as well. Hedge funds donors giving money to the Conservatives. The Conservatives are interested in the fact Labour have got over £300,000 of staff support from PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accountancy firm accused of promoting tax avoidance, something the firm rejects. But after Ed Miliband made this so important, so central to his campaign on tax and raised it at Prime Minister’s questions, that prompted a great deal of comment. There is still heavy fighting in the Kokang region of north-east Myanmar, also known as Burma. A state of emergency was declared on Tuesday after more than 50 government troops and 26 rebels were killed in clashes. The violence seems to have been triggered by the return of a rebel leader from the Kokang ethnic group, who was driven out of the country in 2009. This report from the BBC’sjonah Fisher, who is the only internationaljournalist to have made it into the special region. Myanmar’s newest war is in one of its most remote corners. On our way through the mountains to Kokang we catch our first glimpse of damage from the fighting. This truck was part of a convoy and was shot at as it tried to evacuate migrant workers. It is not clear who is responsible. As we move on we have to talk our way through several military checkpoints before reaching a border town. We are now in what is known as the Kokang special region. There is a state of emergency in place here which basically means the military are in charge. jonah Fisher from the BBC. In the last week of fighting the Army has lost nearly 50 men with dozens of rebels and civilians killed. The reason? The return of this man, Kokang rebel leader Phone Kya Shin from five years of exile in China. Apart from the soldiers, this is a ghost town, a normally vibrant community emptied overnight. Then we spotted a small group moving towards the border. This Kokang woman says she has not felt safe since soldiers arrived in town. Ethnically Chinese, but recognised as a Burmese group, in the last week 30,000 Kokang are thought to have fled into China. just behind those houses over there is the Chinese border. The Chinese have an awkward problem at the moment. The three most active Burmese rebel groups are all operating along this frontier. Beijing is stressing that it wants peace and stability, but there are certainly officials and businessmen in China who are profiting from the wars here. Some of the displaced who do not have Chinese heritage are headed to a Burmese town where a large monastery has opened its doors. This woman’s husband was among 19 soldiersjust killed in a rebel ambush last week. This is your husband. TRANSLATION: I tell my daughter that her father was killed in a battle, but she does not understand. She still thinks he is alive somewhere. Six months ago a nationwide ceasefire appeared close, now it is a distant dream. As more Burmese flee the fighting it is the role that China is playing which is under scrutiny. Over 120 Muslims, jews and Christians have marched through London in a pilgrimage. Organisers of the march to show that all three faiths can work together say it’s intended to show solidarity between those faiths after the recent killings in Paris, Copenhagen and the US. A mental health trust covering Norfolk and Suffolk has become the first in the country to be put into special measures. The decision follows a Care Quality Commission report which found that the trust was ""not a safe, effective or responsive service."" NHS regulator Monitor is also imposing the condition that leadership team members are removed if improvements aren’t made swiftly. Parents of children with mental health problems in England are to get more say in how their child is cared for. It follows a survey for NHS England which suggested many families have experienced long delays and poor care. Our social affairs correspondent, Michael Buchanan reports. Why can’t this teenager get the help she needs. The 17-year-old suffers from depression, anxiety and agoraphobia and over the years had care has been an even, she has sometimes waited months. During the time waiting my condition deteriorated even more than it had. I began to self harm. My admissions to A&E became more and more frequent. She has had to give up school, so her mother was forced to stop working, seeing her daughter’s illness working over the past few years and sometimes through poor care has on occasion and splintered the family. It has been extremely stressful for us all to see her in that situation through no fault of her own. She is ill and should have access to mental health care on the same basis as someone who is physically ill. This experience is sadly not unique. A survey of over 370 parents found over a quarter had to wait over a year to receive treatment for their child, while two thirds say they did not get enough support. They struggled to find anything positive to say about it, everything is rubbish as far as they are concerned. We have heard from the survey a real wake-up call for the system. We are listening to it and working with parents and children to design ways to improve the system. We know from experience over the last four years of working with children and adolescent mental health service that if we do that we will get better services. The findings are just the latest evidence of the problems in children’s mental health services. Budgets have been cut by 6% in real terms since 2010, demand is rising and children are finding it increasingly difficult to get the care they need. NHS England say they are investigating and investing in improvement. New NHS beds have been open for those with the most severe problems whilst extra money has been found to tackle eating disorders. A fossil left in a cupboard for 30 years, and thought to be a plaster copy, has turned out to be a new species of ancient reptile. It is the remains of a 189-million-year-old ichthyosaur, a marine reptile, and paleontologists say it’s so well preserved they can work out what it ate for its last meal. Here’s our Science Reporter Victoria Gill. 189 million years old, and so well preserved that you can even see tiny evidence of the squid it eight for its last meal. For three decades this remarkable fossil was tucked away in a cupboard at Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery. Infact, it was thought to be a plaster cast. Now it turns out it’s a very valuable piece of the fossil record. When this young scientist rediscovered the ancient treasure he realised it was the genuine remains of a marine reptile from the jurassic period. Now, having compared it with other specimens around the world, he has confirmed it to be a previously unknown species. This ichthyosaur helps to literally add a tiny piece to a humongous puzzle of the entire history of life. This shows that during this one period of time 189 million years ago that this species was living alongside other distinct species of ichthyosaurs. We are able to potentially track its evolution through time and we know what it was feeding on as well. The dolphin-like a reptile swam in the seas around Britain when the dinosaurs roamed. It’s been named ichthyosaurus anningae after Mary Anning, the British fossil hunter, who discovered the first-ever ichthyosaur emerging from the rocks of the Dorset coast 200 years ago. Since then Mary discovered many more ichthyosaurs and not one has ever been named after her. So this is the first one ever of the ichthyosaurs there has been named after Mary Anning. And for me personally it’s a true honour to be able to name it after somebody who is intertwined with British palaeontology. The hope now is that the revelation about its significance right help track down the fossil hunter who found this particular specimen. For now, though, it’s come out of the store room and will be put in pride of place on permanent display in the museum. Victoria Gill, BBC News. Our top story today: the company that owns British Gas has seen a big fall in profits. They fell by 35% last year. In a moment, a full national weather forecast plus the news where you are. First the sports news. Luis Figo launched his manifesto today for the FIFA presidency and says he would consider expanding the world cup. The former Portugal international is one of three men challenging the current president Our sports news correspondent Richard Conway was at the launch at Wembley today. Richard what exactly is he proposing to do IF elected? In short what he was promising is money and lots of it. It is all about keeping those financial promises. They have done very well out of the World Cup. Anyone who wants to take on Sepp Blatter needs to make those securities that the financial promises will not dry up. He talked a lot about how reserves could be used and how money could be going to the 209 member associations and about expanding it from 32 countries up to 48. That will go down well outside of Europe in the smaller countries and that is where Luis Figo needs to target his attention. One of the things he told me was he was determined the election was about ideas and not a personal battle. I’m not running against Sepp Blatter, I have nothing against Sepp Blatter. I think he did very good things for football, for the organisation. What I’m running for is showing, or implementing some new ideas that I think are important for the organisation. So that election takes place on May 29. Lewis Fieger will have to travel the world to sell the ideas but he won’t be alone on those campaigns, there may be a degree of Alliance and strategy building between the men as they seek to dislodge Sepp Blatter in May. It should be quite a battle, thank you. The QPR manager Chris Ramsey says a group of Chelsea supporters who allegedly racially abused a man in Paris are not true fans of football. The group were filmed preventing a black man from boarding a train at a metro station in the French capital and chanting about being racist. Ramsey - who is the Premier League’s only black manager- says Chelsea Football Club are not to blame. ~ I don’t believe they are Chelsea fans. I don’t believe they are fans of football. I believe they are acting in a manner that we all know and think is a thing of the past. I wouldn’t be blaming Chelsea football club for that because if you’ve got people with those views, those views are intrinsic in everyday life. At the Cricket World Cup, Zimbabwe recorded their highest ever run-chase to avoid an embarrassing defeat to the United Arab Emirates. The UAE are competing in their first World Cup in 19 years and were led by Shaiman Anwar who hammered a career-best 67 as they reached 285-7. Zimbabwe started slowly in reply, but Sean Williams’ 76 not out saw them home. They won by four wickets. Meanwhile England’s women thrashed New Zealand to win the first Twenty-20 international by eight wickets. They bowled the hosts out forjust 60. Spinner Heather Knight took three wickets for two runs to reduce them to 10-4 after five overs. Captain Charlotte Edwards made an unbeaten 32 as England reached their target with 50 balls to spare. Britain’s women cyclists will be hoping to re-assert their dominance in the team pursuit at the World Championships this evening - they taking on Canada in the semi-finals. The quartet of Katie Archibald, Laura Trott, Elinor Barker and joanna Rowsell qualified second fastest behind Australia in Paris. It was the first time they have been beaten in the event for more than four years. Britain also qualified second fastest in the men’s event. Lizzy Yarnold is aiming to complete an historic career quadruple when the skeleton World Championships begin later this month. She will lead a six-strong British team in Germany, and is hoping to become first Briton to hold the World, Olympic and European titles at the same time. Yarnold has never won the World title. Last weekend she won her fourth World Cup Gold and finished second in the overall season standings. Those championships begin in four days. That is all the sport for now, back to you. The world’s largest movement of human beings has been taking place over the last few days as people celebrate the Lunar New Year. Hundreds of millions of people have been travelling home to celebrate the Year of the Sheep. Our Beijing correspondent Martin Patience has been to a traditional temple to see the festivities. Even by Chinese standards it’s incredibly busy, and there’s a fair amount of barging going on. If you are not one for crowds, this is certainly not the place to be. Traditionally families gather at temple fairs to mark the start of the New Year. Events like this one are happening right across the country. One of the most common wishes is for a prosperous New Year. These were once religious events where people would offer prayers for a good harvest, but there is not much of that here. Commercialisation has set in and everyone is trying their luck. For some here a good start to the new year means winning a cuddly toy. Hello. TRANSLATION: I hope we can pay off our mortgage sooner, that is the most important thing. I want the country to be prosperous and peaceful. We are four generations of my family and I hope everyone remains healthy. I hope and pray I can find a wife this year, that is my biggest wish. I came here because there are loads of people and it is a great atmosphere. For the Chinese the celebrations are the same every year. But there is a debate this year. Is this the year of the sheep, the goat or the ram? The problem is the Chinese character could be all three of them. In China it is not a concern, so it is just a case of taking your pick. Martin Patience, BBC News, Beijing. Time for a look at the weather. Closer to home your appreciation of the day so far will be determined by where you are in relation to this weather front. A great swathe of cloud, it is not moving very far very fast. It hasn’t quite made it down to the south-east but following behind a different kettle of fish in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some dry weather will be had across the south-west but the rain is certainly there to be had. If you are in this feature. There are moderate bursts of rain so lots of surface water and spray around. The further north you are into the top end of England, certainly for Northern Ireland and Scotland there is a bright and fresh wheel. Some hefty showers and a south-westerly wind, turning wintry above 300 metres, so it’s high ground for the most part. The front through the evening and overnight tries to get away, the bulk of the rain gets away from the south-east for a while but there is a legacy of cloud and rain on the southern shores, we think. Further north than that, in the south not a problem but further north enough in the way of clear skies for there to be a bit of ice first thing on Friday. The top two thirds bright, fresh and sunny on Friday, a bit wintry at the top end of the Pennines, the trans-Pennine ‘s, betterthink about that. Further south notice how the rain slowly pulls away over to the southeastern corner but never quitting in the afternoon. Remember we talked about 16 yesterday but think six, much closer to the mark. Once the low pressure is out of the way notice how the isobars crank around and the wind will come from north-west to south-east, a fresh feeling kind of day, blustery wind and plenty of showers across western parts. Some of those wintry across the high ground and even in the south, in the Cotswolds and the top end of Wales. The start of the weekend, bright and cold, some sunshine and showery. Sunday will be wet and windy. Eventually for all of us. Chilly start, high-pressure overnight, little ridge of high pressure so clear skies and a touch of frost. And here comes the rain. I will stop proceedings around midday. We think at the moment some snow on the higher ground. We are not quite all in it together at best age but we are later in the day, there is no escape as you can see and it is quite wet and there may well be Met Office warnings for this windy affair, what’s going on, see you later. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: There has been a big fall for the owners of rigid gas in profits, down 35% on last year. -- British Gas. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News - I’m Katharine Carpenter. London commuters have bombarded rail companies with complaints on social media. Data analysts from Commute London looked at Twitter messages sent to 14 train operators. They found over 250,000 mentioned delays and 62,000 raised concerns about overcrowding. Ayshea Buksh has more. I’m in the offices of Commute London. This is the company that has spent the last year monitoring all the social media feeds of the different railway companies that take passengers in and out of the capital. With me is the director of the company, Daren Wood. Thanks very much forjoining us this afternoon. Daren, explain the technology and how it was used. OK. What we do is look at all the social media feeds and Twitter feeds of the main operators coming into London, analyse them for the content and the things people are saying as they are trying to travel around the network to give these live service indications of how commuters are currently experiencing services. So, let’s have a look at one of them. If we look at South West Trains at the moment we can see the sorts of issues that are on people’s minds as they are trying to move around. At the moment we can see the sort of things coming up at the top of the list - delays, always quite common. We can see the hashtags that people are using as they move their way around. Do you find certain companies fare worse than others? We do find quite a wide variation across different operators. The South London operators do struggle a bit more than some of the others. We see Greater Anglia and First Great Western quite high in terms of the number of tweets they receive. Do you think the rail companies are listening to the users that tweet? I think they are starting to. They are trying to engage in real time with customers. I think there is a way to go. Using this type of media to look at how services are performing live, what is really on commuters’ minds, notjust delays and cancellations but the other things that really matter to commuters as they try and make their way around the capital. Darren, many thanks. A spokesman for the rail delivery company said they had embraced social media across the board and they can react quicker to queries 'fI’oITI CUSloITIâIâS. Another cyclist has died after being hit by a lorry in central London this morning. The tipper truck struck the woman as it turned left onto Victoria Street at around 8am. She is the fourth cyclist to have died on the capital’s roads this year. London’s landfill sites are expected to be full by 2025 but local authorities are being accused of not doing enough to cut down rubbish. Food accounts for around 20% of domestic waste in the capital but the London Assembly found that ten boroughs don’t offer any separate food bin collection. Half of London’s households are left without the option to recycle. Most Mahrez do have a food waste collection scheme. But far too many of them only apply to street level properties and not flats. London is very urban pounds most WE we need food waste collection because of vermin and the smell and all the rest of it. People from different religions are marching through the capital Londoners are being urged to explore their creative side with the launch of a new, year-long project celebrating the arts. 'Get Creative’ will see the BBC working with amateur and professional organisations around the country to champion Now the Weather with Alina jenkins. How is it looking? A bit wet? Increasingly wet throughout the afternoon. This band of rain is moving but now it’s settling and there it stays through the rest of the day. Persistent rain for the rest of the afternoon, sometimes heavy. We’ve also got a strengthening south-westerly wind, so quite a blustery feel for the afternoon despite highs of eight or ",,

Tonight on BBC London: The man racially abused by Chelsea football fans in Paris says they should be punished. A cyclist dies after colliding with a tipper truck - the fourth to die in less than two months. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. A 19-year-old man who was planning to behead a British soldier has been found guilty of preparing a terrorist act. When Brusthom Ziamani was arrested last year he was carrying a 12-inch knife and a hammer. The court heard that Ziamani had been inspired by the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013, and that he idolised one of his killers. He’s due to be sentenced next month. Our Home Affairs Correspondent june Kelly is at the Old Bailey. The night Brusthom Ziamani is facing a lengthyjail term. The head of Scotland Yard’s counterterrorism Scotland Ya rd’s counterterrorism command Scotland Yard’s counterterrorism command said this was a young man who was radicalised not by the Internet or social media, but by other people. What is also significant in this case is the speed of his radicalisation. Brusthom Ziamani only became a Muslim last spring. Very quickly he embraced radical Islam with his extremist ideology and within months of his conversion he expressed support for Islamic State and declared he was planning to behead a British soldier. In this exclusive footage obtained by the BBC, he is on the streets at a demonstration. He described how he was desperate to fit in with fellow activists. A few months later he would be out alone and armed foran months later he would be out alone and armed for an attack. When he was stopped and arrested he had this 12 inch knife. He was also carrying a hammer to use inch knife. He was also carrying a hammerto use on hammer to use on his chosen victim and with his weapons he had a black flag. This case for us raises questions about the need for all of us to confront and challenge those who propagate and talk about this form of Islam, who think it is acceptable to encourage and incite others to commit terrorism. It was the barbaric street murder of fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich which inspired Ziamani. He was said to idolise the killers. Ziamani said that because Lee Rigby was not a Muslim he was burning in hell. This was a boy who had been brought up as a jehovah’s witness. He said when he abandoned the family faith for Islam his relationship with his parents ended. Homers, he was helped by his local mosque in south-east London. He came to worship with us and I can remember the first day he became a Muslim. We are always very beautiful and sympathetic with people who are newcomers. But the Imam says it is now clear the convert failed to grasp his new religion did not advocate violence and soon he was on a more radical path. There are a 2 billion around the world. He joined followers of an extremist preacher and posted fanatical messages on Facebook. And he wrote, but did not send, a letter to his estranged family. It read, to my beloved parents, now with the current situation in Iraq and Syria and neighbouring countries, my brothers and sisters are being raped, killed and tortured. It is a duty to help mY and tortured. It is a duty to help my brothers and sisters and because I have no means of getting there I will wage war against the British Government on this soil. That letter was found by police when they first moved in on Brusthom Ziamani. He was staying at a flat on this estate. In the weeks that followed officers attempted to deradicalisation. His response was, it is too late. Ziamani was out on bail but under surveillance when he was arrested. It appears he had no accomplice and was alone. In eastern Ukraine, there’s been heavy shelling around the main rebel city of Donetsk. It had been hoped that the fall of the strategic town Secretary Michael Fallon has warned that Russia posed a threat to the Baltic states. Our Diplomatic Correspondent james Robbins reports. In eastern Ukraine separatist rebels backed by Russia still celebrate yesterday’s success carving out more territory, trampling the Ukrainian flag of the Kiev Government which seeks closer links with the West, not the Kremlin. Amid huge international pension Moscow is keeping up its pressures on Britain and other Nato countries. Four months Russian bombers have been probing Britain’s air defences. This is video from one of those Russian aircraft is what appeared to be RAF typhoons and other Nato aircraft coming very close to shadow them. This is not yesterday’s incident, but illustrates what is happening with increasing amounts. It is what the Foreign Secretary was complaining about when he accused Russia of threatening Baltic states. He called the president a real and present danger is saying, Putin is as great a threat to Europe as Islamic State. The Prime Minister also sees Russia as a long-term threat, but was more dismissive of their pressure in the air. I suspect the Russians are trying to make a point and we should not dignify it with too much of a response. But Michael Fallon also talked about Nato getting ready, staging exercises, building up rapid reaction forces in the Baltic states. The alliance is committed to defend any member state and its basic all for one principle. There is no doubting the tensions between Russia and the West, with each side suspicions the other poses a threat. Russia faces 26 Nato countries on this side of the Atlantic, from Iceland to Turkey, in their military alliance with the United States and Canada. But the real tension is over the Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, independent of Moscow since the collapse of the Russian Empire. All have Russian speaking minorities who would like closer ties to Moscow. In Estonia they make up 24% of the population and in Latvia it is 26. Russia says there is no cause for alarm about what is happening in Ukraine or the bomber flight close to British airspace. The Russian airforce is returning back to the previous practices. Compared to the number of flights by the Royal Air Force and other Nato air forces, the number is minuscule. Conflict in Ukraine is not widely seen as a pro lead to such direct military action in the Baltic states, but everything does point to a far more assertive and unpredictable Russian. Centrica, which owns British Gas, has reported a big fall in profits after being hit by lower oil prices and warmer weather. The energy company said full year profits fell by 35 to £1.75 billion. Centrica says payments to shareholders will be cut and that could hit pension funds. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed reports. Nobody wants to make up to a chilly home. And nobody wants to wake up to a chilly forecast for a business either. But that was the case for Centrica today, which saw profits down by more than a third. After criticisms that the business was made too much money, this morning the share price sank as investors feared it was now making too little. When I met Ian Conn, the new Chief Executive, I asked him how tough the energy market was. We have seen falling oil and gas prices, which have impacted our North Sea business significantly. Secondly, we have seen weather patterns which have been very unusual. The warm weather last year helped our customers and I’m delighted for them. But actually the volume of gas we sold was down and that impacted our profits. He said that British Gas had done all it could to cut bills, but customers like Pamela said the worst of the wint irwould be over before the price cuts took effect. Everybody wants cheaper gas, particularly over the winter time when it’s going, you are needing so much more gas for your heating. Centrica’s problems go far beyond the issue of bills. North Sea investment will be cut by 40%, the income to investors will fall by 30% and Centrica announced it was closing two power stations, raising questions about the UK’s energy supply. Energy has long been a political football since the leader of the opposition Ed Miliband made this commitment in 2013. The next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017. The Conservatives retaliated, saying Labour’s policy would make companies nervous about cutting bills before the election. We don’t set prices for political reasons, we very much set prices to win customers and retain them. But he is sceptical about politicians involving themselves in energy. I don’t personally believe that it’s always a good idea to intervene in markets. It can have unintended consequences and Britain has one of the most competitive markets in the world. Despite the uncertainty, Mr Conn said there was no immediate threat to jobs, but Centrica will be announcing the results of a business review in the summer, where cuts could be revealed. Germany has rejected a request by Greece for an extension to its EU loan programme despite earlier signs that a compromise was possible. Greece had sought an assistance package lasting six months, rather than a renewal of the existing deal which comes with tough austerity conditions. If there’s no agreement, the country faces running out of money. Let’s join our correspondent in Athens Mark Lowen. For about an hour today it appeared a deal was in sight. Greece had formulated a proposal for an extension of its loan which was welcomed by Brussels. It called a meeting of Eurozone finance ministers for tomorrow to rubber-stamp the agreement. But then came the rejection from Germany and the night once again the financial future of Greece and the euro zone hangs in the balance. Five years since the debt crisis erupted, Greece is still shaking the euro zone. Today Athens was pushed to what it thought would be a deal, and they called a meeting of finance ministers tomorrow. But within minutes Germany said it was not enough. The proposal had been mediated by euro zone officials, the wording carefully chosen. Greece’s loan would be extended for six months, hoping for some flexibility in the conditions. The Government would make no changes without EU agreement and it agreed to supervision by EU institutions which it had campaigned against. But Berlin insisted Greece stick to the original bailout. TRANSLATION: We checked that everything we agreed would be adhered to and this is not clarified in this letter and we have to make progress in their negotiations ahead. This letter should be seen as a start, not an end to the negotiations. A rift at the heart of the Eurozone raising fears of a Greek default. In Athens today concern about the next step, but still support for the Government. The Germans should not be negative about everything and help more. We hope that the solution will be found at the end because we do not want to leave the Eurozone, or the euro. do not want to leave the Eurozone, orthe euro. But or the euro. But we cannot go on in this situation. So often Greece has been saved by last-minute deals. Can its place in the euro be secured? It will go down to the wire. Police in Nottinghamshire say there are more than 150 potential suspects in their investigation into alleged historical abuse at children’s homes. Detectives are investigating claims of abuse at 13 children’s homes over a 40-year period. Meanwhile, a former social worker has told the BBC that abuse in the past was not properly investigated. Here’s Tom Bateman. Beechwood Remand Home, what should have been a safe haven for troubled children but what instead, it is claimed, was a protected environment for those who sought to abuse them. I actually believed he was giving me an examination to check I was all right. This man was sent to Beechwood when he was 13. Now in his mid-50s he has decided to speak publicly for the first time. He says he placed his trust in a worker there who then sexually abused him. He did molest me. I went for help and it took some courage for me to ask him. They let me down. 40 years of Beechwood’s past is the subject of one of the most complex police investigations in the Nottinghamshire force’s history and the inquiry now goes well beyond this one institution, covering 13 former homes and more than 150 potential abusers. Much of what may have gone on behind the locked doors in Beechwood is now lost to history. The two councils who ran homes in this area are now promising a full enquiry. But the claims have been growing louder that the police and local officials were told about allegations of abuse at the time and did not respond. A former social worker in Nottinghamshire during the 1990s who wants to remain anonymous says sexual abuse was suspected in homes, but claims that police did not believe children. My professional opinion is that they viewed them as worthless. She claims some police officers had an expression for young people from deprived estates. The first time I heard it was in the youth court and I was stood outside and I happened to make polite conversation with a police officer. And he said something, ""Oh, he’s a ""SAFU"" anyway."" I said, ""He’s a what?"" He said, ""Subnormal and BLEEP useless."" I think I was just stunned. The inquiry has meant a challenge for the man whose job it is to hold Nottinghamshire police to account. We have had separate police forces come in to look at their investigation. If you are saying to me things maybe went wrong in the past, having listened to the victims, I think they are probably right. The police say they are determined to ensure a thorough investigation. Nottinghamshire is one of several local authorities facing serious questions about how they dealt with historical abuse claims. Meanwhile, the victims still wait for answers. Our top sotory tonight: A teenager who was on his way to behead a soldier with a knife when he was arrested is found guilty of preparing a act.

And waste not want not, but how many of us are actually able to recycle our food leftovers. The housing shortage across England has worsened, according to figures out today, with the numbers of new properties built in the last quarter of 2014 down by 9% compared to the previous year. Critics say successive governments have failed to get to grips with the housing crisis and that its effects will be felt by generations to come. Our Home Editor Mark Easton reports. Figures show the number of new homes started was down 9 town on a year earlier. Despite the Prime Minister’s pledge to get Britain building, the numbers fell far short of what it is said are required. We are not building half the number of homes we need. It is going down more in the future and we are going to failfuture generations in the future and we are going to fail future generations who are not going to have homes they can afford to live in. Planners say England needs 245,000 homes each year from 2011 to 2031. Last year sawjust 118,000 completed. The short fall more than half a million homes. The problem is most acute in the capital, where official figures show the average house now costs more than £500,000 and average rents are over 1,600 a month. than £500,000 and average rents are over1,600 a month. Housing over 1,600 a month. Housing should be a priority according to the department of commerce. Housing costs mean it is now a struggle to recruit skilled workers. This tiny one bed London flat was built on the understandping it would only be sold to local people with moderate incomes. -- to local people with moderate incomes. -- understanding. We have floor to window ceilings... The company behind this development say they’re oversubscribed. We have a large database of people who want to buy the homes. We have over 17,000. And after this interview another 500 will register. This blogger set himself the challenge of living in London for under £500. Solutions included an empty barge. This is a kitchen area. A commune. It has a familiar smell about it. And a horse box. It is very snug at night. I got back from work and wanted some peace and quiet and run a nice warm bath and I was warring myself with a -- washing myself with a cold bucket of water. The Government says it inherited a broken housing market and said the figures are the best since the economic crash. But demand for homes looks certain to outstrip Supply for homes looks certain to outstrip supply for the whole of the next Parliament, whoever wins the election. Police Scotland has admitted it has lost 20,000 stop and search records from last year because of a computer programing mistake. Recently the force had to apologise for giving out incorrect information to the police watchdog on its stop and search statistics, and there’s been controversy over who is searched. Officers are currently trying to recover the lost data. Parents of children with mental health problems in England will get more say on their care, according to the NHS. It comes after a survey of parents for the charity Young Minds on behalf of NHS England suggested that many families have experienced long delays and poor care. NHS England says it’s a wake-up call for the system. Our Social Affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan has been to speak to one woman whose daughter has autism. She is loving and very sper Taining, intelligent, challenging. She is always managed to escape from places. You put that down initially to herjust being naughty or challenging? Strong-willed. Because she challenging? Strong-willed. Because she was so intelligent. Very creative. Sporting. After her dad died, I did go to the doctor to say I think she needs help, because she is not dealing with her grief. She told the councillor he thought about taking her own life. She was 11. Months later she made her first suicide attempt and she was sent to a unit 150 miles away. She wasn’t safe. Another girl beat her up. She sobbed down the phone, I want a cuddle, I need you. Any child that gets hurt wants a hug. She is now in hospital following a second suicide attempt. Sally travels from Hull several times a week. You must have dark days? Ido. Nearly every morning, I would like to stay in bed and pretend the world is not existing and run away. But that is not going to help Maisie, I’m her mum. So how is she? She is a bit sad, because she is not allowed home. She has not had a great week. But I recorded Maisie giving you a message. I want to go home and be with my mum. She comes two or three times during the week, which is not fair, because all the other kids get to see their parents every night. When you look at the future, what do you think? It is a scary thought. But I’m hoping she gets the tools and treatment to try and help her and provide her that strength and the courage to deal with this. There is lots of people can achieve greatnesses in their life. You still have hope? Yes I have hope for her, yes. If you’ve been affected by the issues in this report, or want to know more about the survey, head to bbc.co.uk/health. It nearly went in the bin, with its owners thinking it was junk. But this bust of a cat turned out to be a 2,500-year-old ancient Egyptian bronze. And a valuable one at that. jon Kay has been following the story in Penzance. This is the story of an old lady with a cat. But Doreen had no idea how special. When she died at 95, relatives were clearing her cottage and were about to throw out what they thought was a bit ofjunk. That junk was in fact a rare artefact from ancient Egypt. A bronze statue that once contained the mummified remains of a cat. Spotted just in time and saved from the bin by a local auctioneer. There was a skip, they thought it was nothing. Look at it now. Hurray! No wonder he is cheering. At 52. Selling at 52,000. Today it was bought by a phone bidder. The cat has been authenticated by experts, but how did it get to Cornwall. Doreen’s late husband had business links to Howard Carter, the archaeologist who was at the tomb of a famous site. It makes it that much more value. If I had known I would have stroked it each Tay. The family don’t want to be identified, but friends say she was amazed. Did she like cats? No, she had dogs. Real dogs? Yes. If you can call them that, yes. So what next? Well first stop London and the specialist dealer who has bought it and then it will probably go on to the international art market. But one thing is for sure, it is days of obscurity are over. Now the weather. I think there will be a lot of sunshine over the next couple of days. It is this clear gap that I’m relying on to give some sunshine tomorrow. But it will be chilly. Ahead of that we have cloud and rain still in the more south eastern areas. The north and west, wintry showers across Highland Scotland, the snowfalling to lower levels and parts of Northern Ireland. But a lot of dry and bright weather to start the day tomorrow morning. Across the south, temperatures down low. Along the south coast a shield of cloud. This weather front here has been causing some headaches I must say, because 24 hours ago that rain could have spread further north. Now, it looks as if it mayjust confined to the far south-east of England. But we will keep an eye on that. Between that sunshine. Further wintry showers in the Highlands and Northern Ireland. And the snow will lower with time. Quite a wintry night and the odd further wintry shower in Wales and the south-west. Beware of the ice. Saturday will be a reasonable day. The best of sunshine in the south and east. Some wintry weather in northern Scotland for a time. But cold on Saturday. Temperatures struggling despite the sunshine. Five or six degrees through the heart of the UK. So chilly on Saturday. But there will be some sunshine. And on Sunday it goes pear-shaped with some weather and windy weather. Our main story: A teenager who was planning to behead a British soldier has been found guilty of preparing to commit a terrorist attack. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me and on BBC One we nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you are. Tonight on BBC London News. Racially abused and pushed from a train - the victim of a gang of chanting Chelsea fans says they should be punished. ~ I figured it was because of the colour of my skin. Scotland Yard says it’s working with French police to catch the perpetrators. Also tonight: A cyclist has died after colliding with a tipper truck - the woman in her 30s is the fourth to die in less than two months.

Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. Cycling safety campaigners say a combination of road design and construction vehicles mean the capital’s roads are becoming increasingly dangerous for cyclist. It’s after a cyclist was killed in a collision with a tipper truck during rush hour in Westminster. The woman, in her 30s, died at the scene. She is the fourth cyclist to have been killed in the capital this year. Our reporter, Yvonne Hall, is at the scene. This is where the latest tragedy happened near Victoria station. This area is undergoing massive redevelopment and the road gets very busy with construction vehicles. just at eight o’clock this morning before the rush year-- rush hour, a cyclist is thought to have been in collision with a tipper truck as they were both turning left. Two years ago, another cyclist was also killed here when she was in collision with a vehicle as well. For cyclists have now died on London’s road this year alone. Safety campaigners are calling for urgent action, including reducing the speed limit on busy roads like this and safer lorries to be injured used as quickly as possible. We believe these trucks are unfit for person -- believe these trucks are unfit for person -- purpose. There should be a safety design for lorries in London. We have challenged the construction industry to have safer lorries where the drivers line of sight is where cyclists and pedestrians are. And what does Transport for London have to say? Well, it says that making the roads safer for cyclists in a top priority for the man that their spending £1 billion on existing the cycling superhighways and improving junctions like this. They say cyclists should see an improvement in the next few weeks. That, of course, is of little comfort to another family in course, is of little comfort to anotherfamily in mourning tonight. Are you the type of person to take to Twitter to complain This raised Dash-mac during the morning commute. It seems that rail companies are taking notice and it is now considered the most effective way of getting a response. When things go wrong on the trains it seems many others vent our frustration online. According to a recent study, over the past year, nearly 1.8 million tweets have been linked to rail companies that take us in and out of the capital. 280,000 concerned delays and 70,000 were about cancellations. 62,000 where regarding the -- were about cancellations. 62,000 where regarding the -- overcrowding. Southern came top with complaints of cancellations. We look at tweets coming into the main operators. The research was done by data analysts. It was found that Greater Anglia were the most popular in terms of tweets and there is a mix of satisfaction. Southern also. South London operators experience a lot of problems at the moment than they tend to fare worse than long-distance operator. Some believe this public expression of satisfaction is putting pressure on all sorts of companies. The question is whether we will see change as a result and if the power will translate to change. Indications are thatit translate to change. Indications are that it will because the companies are being held more publicly to account. It’s difficult to obtain figures from private companies about how much investment they’re putting into technology. The rail delivery group which represents rail companies told the BBC its operators have embraced social media so when things go one they can give passengers the latest travel information and answer queries quickly. But not all passengers we spoke to use social media. I would either phone or send an e-mail. I feel they have a team to have customer relations with the you know you get a response. I would public going talk to somebody. It’s hoped that the technology we have will help redress the balance of power for the commuter.

What can be done? our political correspondence reports. It’s not a pretty sight, butjust outside the M25 is a plant turning London’s waste into energy and fertiliser. It’s coming from Croydon and dust carts from Woking and the surrounding area. Roughly 1+0 tonnes of food waste there at the moment. It’s an anaerobic digestion is this dumb. It is like a giant cow. We have 1+500 tanks each eight metres tall and they hold the material and we feed from one type to the next. The London assembly says not enough is actually happening. The environment witty says 23 London boroughs collect food waste, but 16 offer none for flats. Nearly half of London’s households don’t recycle their food waste. That means that nearly 20% of waste we throw away to landfill is food waste. It’s one area where clearly the boroughs and the mayor can do something to do do something to improve recycling rate substantially. This project in Kings Cross shows how it can be done on a small scale. Bikes collect food waste from factories and feed it into a mini and aerobic digester. The fertiliser and gas goes back to local firms and they think it is a model that could work across the capital. We could have lots more of these digesters around and reduce the amount of weight -- these digesters around and reduce the amount of weight -- ways that travelled out of the city, so reducing waste miles and emissions. While London is getting better yet recycling food waste, some recyclers feel the message needs to be clearer. A food waste bin in your home or Trevor it is is for banana skins and not bananas. It’s for apple cores and not apples. It the apple and put the Apple Corps in the bin. It’s common sense will stop for now, around 60,000 tonnes of London’s food waste will continue to come to this plant every year. The man pushed from the train in Paris has spoken. Scotland Yard says it’s working with French detect this and Chelsea football club to identify those in the video. These pictures of Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro have now been watched across the world. As a black man tries to board the train, he is pushed back by the fans who were heard to sing: Two days on and the victim has spoken to a French newspaper. I was alone. I didn’t come to fight. I was just trying to get home. Ifigured it was because of the colour of my skin. In France, people have always been targeted for the colour of their skin regardless of their background. Chelsea’s next match is on Saturday at Stanford Bridge and with increasing media interest, Blues fans are wary of the reception that awaits them. Most supporters are getting their tin hats on to deal with a swarm of media journalists descending on Stanford Bridge and the majority of supporters are upset her name has been tarnished thanks to the actions of three of four individuals. I’ve been saying for a long time these are really social issues that manifest themselves in the football world. It would be good to see what the authorities will to do. It’s standard procedure that, for a European football match of this nature involving a London club, a group of Metropolitan Police officers would be invited out, on this occasion, by the French police. Speaking to the Met today, they’ve confirmed today to BBC London that the officers in Paris for Tuesday’s game have returned to London. They’re working on the case, going through the footage with the help of Chelsea Football Club and the French police to try and identify those involved. Souleymane has now made an official complaint to French policeman told the newspaper those involved should be punished and locked up. Anyone convicted could face a prison term of up to three years and a fine of up to £33,000. Our correspondent in Paris Hugh Schofield joins me now for more on this. Hugh, what are the police in France doing to assist Scotland Yard? ~ Idid not I did not get that question. What are the police doing to assist Scotland Yard? A police enquiry has been opened over here and they will coordinate with the British police. All of the people involved will have gone back to Britain but there will be CCTV footage and the possibility of a criminal case being opened and people being remanded for trial, or charges, even though the practicalities are difficult. What has the reaction been in France? People here are bewildered. Yes, the country has known racism in its own way, but it really hasn’t had a tradition of that kind of latent, hooligan related racism that we saw on Tuesday. People have been dumbfounded trying to understand how this can be part of British society. I think people do understand that, evenin I think people do understand that, even in Britain, it is extremely where -- even in Britain, it is extremely where -- rare as well. OK. Thanks very much. Some newsjust Some news just then, football club has announced they have suspended three people from Stanford Ridge as a result of that incident in Paris. People from different religions have made a pilgrimage through the capital in a show of interfaith solidarity. Christian, jewish and Muslim leaders walked from Regents Park mosque and onto the House of Commons to show unity after the recent killings in France, Denmark and America. London is a melting pot of diversity, but Hap sometimes we take it for granted. This piece might invited anyone of any faith to share in the celebration. All walking and talking about differences and similarities. Really good to sit and talk with people. Wejust similarities. Really good to sit and talk with people. We just the same. The faiths are the same deep down. Was it interesting? It was cool. A lot of hatred in the world at the moment so is important to come together in solidarity and peace. As they went from Marske, to synagogue and church, high in their minds was the recent attacks -- and church, high in their minds was the recent attacks -- from Marske to synagogue. It is not because of religion, all religions vie for peace. There were moments of shared reflection. This woman lost her daughter in the London bombings and she started a memorial in her name to raise awareness of childhood blindness. We can bring site to the metaphorically blind through education. We do have a choice. We have seen people so moved by what we are doing. One particular sort of... What’s the point? But we begin slowly to create relationships and it’s really important. More and more people joined in and many new friendships word formed. The start of a beautiful friendship? I hope so. A message sent to politicians. Different backgrounds and different faiths, but plenty in common. Still to come: Why these people have teamed up to encourage us to be creative. The future of space exploration could be pioneered in a laboratory in Surrey. Technology experts in Guildford are collaborating with UCL to build a satellite at the fraction of the usual cost. Twinkle is hoped to give new insight into how planets are formed. Deepin are formed. Deep in Surrey a team of scientists are working to discover what lies beyond our solar system. They are designing a satellite named Twinkle. The aim is to try and identify planets that have an atmosphere, weather and could support life. It’s in the process of being built, but it is similarto in the process of being built, but it is similar to how Twinkle will look. Hollow and with a telescope through the middle. These antenna will be information back to Earth. It is also being led by UCL scientists based in Dorking. The satellite will look at stars far-away and will play tricks with light, meaning when the planet passesin light, meaning when the planet passes in front of a start going behind it, we will use the information to try to understand what the atmosphere is made of. The collaboration of two Surrey -based team is not by accident. It seems this part of the world is becoming the O2 destination for space research. High-end automotive, space and all sorts of scientific companies are drawn to this area. It has a vibrant university here in Guildford. Surrey is a very vibrant place to be. The mission is paid for by a mixture of private and public funding and costs ten times less than previous exploration projects. You can go out there and get really good data without having to spend half £1 billion. This estimates at about £50 million. But this isn’t the first time British scientists have committed to space exploration on the cheap. In 2003, the Beagle spacecraft was last and its low cost was criticised by some as the reason for the failed mission. That failure isn’t a concern for scientist is here. In fouryears isn’t a concern for scientist is here. In four years time, the satellite will be launched and while it’s that there, scientists hope it will pave the way for the future of space exploration. Tottenham Hotspur and its attempts to build a new stadium have been held up in the High Court this week, but tonight, minds are focused on the match at White Hart Lane. Our reporter is there for us. This come petition has extra significance this season, doesn’t it? It does. The reason Tottenham wants to build a bigger stadium is for what they hope will be bigger European nights in the future, the Champions League. For the first time this season, if you win the Europa League you qualify for it. Tottenham will take this match very seriously tonight. We are at the last 32 stage. A long way to go, but a big 11 days coming up because after tonight they play West Ham in the Premier League and they could still finish in the top four. That’s another route to reach the riches and prestige of the Champions League. Next week they travel to Florence for the second leg of the tie on Thursday before the really big one, Chelsea at Wembley in the League Cup final on March the Ist. Spurs are going well at the moment, largely thanks to Harry Caine. 23 goals for him. Roy Hodgson has said he will almost certainly be in his next squad. Despite all the games coming up, Spurs have the quality to cope, says their midfielder. As a team, we have to stick together and work for each other. Yes, hopefully we can finish this season really strongly and I think we can do it with the quality of the group. What’s the latest ahead of the decision at the High Court? We look at that decision at half past nine tomorrow. A judge will rule whether the compulsory purchase order Spurs need to start building their new stadium, which overlaps this current site, whether that is valid. A little business contest is validity -- valid. A little business contest is validity -- local business. But both sides are resigned to the fact this will continue to run. If Archway lose, it seems highly likely they would take it to the Court of Appeal so whatever happens tomorrow, it will not be over but we will be edging closer to a resolution to this long-running saga. One project aims to inspire us to take up a new hobby from dancing to flower arranging and the message is that creativity can change every day life. This south London band raised the roof and drummed enthusiasm into the arts fraternity and famous faces who turned up for the launch of Get Creative at The Conway Hall. The project was initiated by What’s Next, led by the Young Vic’s artistic director. The purpose is to draw attention to the enormous creativity in this country and the enormous pleasure people take in making things and doing things and dancing, singing, writing and reading, and to encourage people to see this as an enormously valuable part of their lives. The BBC and the UK’s cultural organisations have joined forces for this campaign and called on some celebrity champions to extol the virtues of creativity. It’s an antedote to the constriction of what society tells you how you should behave and creativity is liberating. It’s private on one level and it can be shared. This year-long initiative aims to beast creativity in the UK, Dash-mac boost encouraging anyone to get involved in creating activities whilst stimulating the debate about the value of art in our society. We can express ours elves positively and it’s a way we can connect to other will who are like-minded and make friends. When you express yourself and get yourself to a legible way you can show others, it gives you a chance to explore other avenues He’s made a career out of making us laugh but johnny Vegas is also a skilled potter and demonstrated both talents today’s launch. I studied ceramics, which not many people know, as a degree. I’ve tried to apply creativity to everything I’ve done ever since and I’ve always said I’m so glad that I had an artistic education as it teaches you to be original in your approach to anything you do. The campaign will include programs, debates and live events with a website launched today to support all of us in our efforts to develop our artistic skills, find new ones will simply have fun. HOW now the weather with Philip. The nice start didn’t last, did it? No, sorry about that! When the rain set in, there it stayed. There is the odd moderate berthed but it is not amounting to much. Come the end of the night, were off and running! much. Come the end of the night, were offand running! A were off and running! A cold night to the north-west when we have lost the cloud. just when you are hoping it would be plain sailing on Friday, there is a little featured towards the south and it has given me most of the headaches today. Come the afternoon, the rain is certainly wishing up further north. The northern edge is very uncertain at the moment. It could be through London. If you desperately need dry weather, check the forecast tomorrow morning or later this evening because that is not possible at all. Another cold night. Saturday itself, despite one or two showers, is a bright and cold sort of day with a north-westerly breeze which is never a warm direction. Some showers could have a hint of wintry nurse in the Chilterns on the higher ground. Sunday, a lovely start although perhaps frosty. Make the most of it. I’ve stopped this charter middle day but the rain keeps coming through the afternoon and the further east you are, the more likelihood of staying dry for longer. After a frosty start, Sunday will be a wet and windy day. On balance, Saturday will be the better day and watch out for the uncertainty about Friday. The main headlines: A 19-year-old man who was planning to behead a British soldier has been found guilty of preparing to commit a terrorist act. When arrested last year, he was carrying a 12 inch knife and a hammer. In eastern Ukraine there has been heavy shelling around the main rebel held city.

It looks dull. Let that confidence out. ..to be crowned Best British Amateur Artist of 2015. Time is up. Hello and welcome to The One Show with Matt Baker. And Alexjones. The excitement is building. One of the biggest mysteries in television will be solved tonight. That’s right, the question on everybody’s lips... just how did this car get up there? Unbelievable. Not that one, although we will be finding out the answer. The other one. What, what are the best gadgets you can buy your dog? No, it is about who killed Lucy Beale. Come on! Oh, yes, that one. Tonight’s guest is no stranger to an explosive Walford storyline. And we do mean explosive. You look after him for me. Phil! It is Martin Kemp! Welcome back. There is no going back from that, is there? When people say, are you going back in, I think, there? When people say, are you going back in, Ithink, how? You played Steve Owen four years. Have you been following this storyline with Lucy Beale. Absolutely. After I left EastEnders which is getting on for nearly 11 years now, recently, it was the only time I have ever started watching it because of Who Killed Lucy? It is the best storyline. Theories? Ithinkjane did it. Really? My reason is she only came onto the set about two months before the murder and I think she might be disposable. That is an interesting theory! And Ian hasjust married her! Don’t EastEnders love to give it to Ian. They love to give him a hard time. He has been through the mill. It will be Ian killed off left. That will get everybody talking. I reckonjane did it. We know people are celebrating by having EastEnders parties tonight. Do send us your photos, particularly if you are dressed up as someone from the Square. Ahead of our night of drama, the brilliant Zoe Ball is in the middle of all the action. Where are you, Zoe? I am of all the action. Where are you, Zoe? Iam in Beale’s of all the action. Where are you, Zoe? I am in Beale’s Restaurant, the scene of Ian and jane’s wedding last night. Here are some photographs. There is Doctor Legg. He passed away. We have our own CSI who killed Lucy? It is 30 years to the day that EastEnders started. They do like to celebrate with their anniversaries with a gruesome murder. Here is the bust of the Queen Vic which Stacey used to kill Archie Mitchell five years ago. Can you believe it is five years ago? join me later when we will be speculating on tonight’s events and finding out how nervous some of the stars are getting. Thank you. Very much looking forward to it. It is hard to believe that Stacey could pick that up because it is quite heavy. Anyway, carry on. We have been in there so we know how heavy it is. Anyway, we have been following Alex’s visit to Uganda for Comic Relief where she has been following the story and seeing how your money is helping to renovate a dilapidated health centre. If you think the conditions and Call The Midwife are basic, wait until you see what Angela has two cope with. Renovations are well under way at this clinic. There is still quite a lot of work to be done here. But the good news is, these walls are brand-new. Before the work began, the clinic had no drainage or means to dispose of medical waste.

Intense diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the Greek bail out crisis as time runs out Greece asks for help with a six month extension to its loans - but Germany refuses.

And after another cyclist is killed in London, there are renewed calls for restrictions on large trucks. Good evening. Last ditch attempts to solve Greece’s financial problem are taking place after Germany rejected proposals from Athens. Greece was requesting a six month loan extension rather than the renewal of its international bailout, which would mean imposing tough austerity measures. But Germany said it was not a substantial solution. EU finance ministers will meet in Brussels tomorrow. Without a deal, Greece could run out of money by the end of the month. Our Europe editor Gavin Hewitt reports. Tomorrow in Brussels, the eurozone’s finance ministers will thread their way through the European quarter for the third time. It is expected to be the key meeting in the crisis over Greece and its bailout. A deal still hangs in the balance. Athens, this morning. And the Greek government formally requested an extension of its loan agreement for six months. In this letter, they offered significant concessions. They wouldn’t increase spending without approval and they agreed to supervision from the previously despised officials from the EU and IMF. We have made every possible effort, said the Greek Deputy Prime Minister. We want to talk, to address all the sensitive points raised by the other countries. Shortly after, in Brussels, they announced that eurozone finance ministers would meet tomorrow. The European Commission and its President seemed upbeat about the Greek letter. Presidentjunker sees this letter as a positive sign which, in his assessment, could pave the way for a reasonable compromise. An hour later, attention moved to Berlin and a briefing at the Finance Ministry. The Germans dismissed the Greek letter as not a substantial proposal for a solution. They wanted Athens to stick to the conditions of the existing bailout. TRANSLATION: We need to know how the reforms will continue, how we can control whether commitments are being complied with. That is not clear in the letter so far. In a draft paper ahead of tomorrow’s meeting here, it is clear German doubts went deeper. They described the Greek letter as a Trojan horse, aimed at getting financing without a commitment to complete reforms. It led Athens to ask whether Germany speaks for the eurozone. A senior official in Greece said that at tomorrow’s meeting of eurozone finance ministers it will be clear who wants to find a solution and who doesn’t. On the streets, there was concern at Germany’s attitude towards Greece. They should help more, and not be negative about everything. We hope that the solution will be found again. Because we don’t want to leave the euro, the eurozone or the euro. But we cannot go on in that situation. Greece is aware that it could run out of money within weeks. It expects to come under pressure tomorrow to make further concessions. The German Chancellor spoke to the Greek Prime Minister tonight for 50 minutes. Everyone is aware this is a crucial moment for Greece and the eurozone. Gavin Hewitt, BBC News. Our economic editor Robert Preston is here. Explain what is at stake. Well, it is that Greece could run out of money to pay its bills very soon indeed. The Greek government could find itself in that position as soon as the beginning of next month. But, actually, the crisis could be triggered even earlier than that. At the moment, Greek banks are only being kept afloat by emergency loans being made by the Greek central bank. But on the authorisation of the European Central Bank. In the absence of a political agreement to provide more money to Greece, the European Central Bank will certainly decide thatit Central Bank will certainly decide that it cannot continue to finance Greek banks. Now, at that moment, Greek banks will go bust, unless the Greek government imposes capital controls, bans on people taking money out. That, many people would say, was tantamount to Greece leaving the eurozone, because the free movement of capital is absolutely central to a single currency. All of which would be desperately painful for Greece. It would mean as nurses and households could not borrow, they would be back into a really terrible recession. -- businesses and households. It would also be terrible for the rest of the eurozone. Interestingly, because losses would pile up very quickly for those that lent money to Greece, the biggest victim of those losses would be Germany, which is the very country which appears right now to be blocking a deal. A teenager who was arrested in London last year carrying a knife, a hammer and a black Islamic flag has been found guilty of a plot to behead a British soldier. The Old Bailey heard that Brusthom Ziamani had been inspired by the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013. Our Home Affairs Correspondent june Kelly reports. Ziamani only became a Muslim last spring. Very quickly he embraced radical Islam with its extremist ideology. Soon he was expressing SOOFI i’Iâ WGS âXpI’âSSiI’Ig SUppoIâl Islamic State, then he declared he was planning to behead a British soldier. Here at a and station how he was desperate to fit in with fellow activists. They few months later he would be out alone and armed for an attack. When he was stopped and arrested, he had this 12 inch knife. He was also carrying a hammer to use on his chosen victim. With his weapons, he had a black flag. the banned terrorist organisation. He was radicalised through personal contact. By his own testimony in court, he has attended meetings, he has looked up to senior members of a proscribed terrorist organisation. It was the barbaric street murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich which inspired Ziamani. He was said to idolise the killers, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. This was a boy who had been brought UP This was a boy who had been brought up as a jehovah’s Witness. He said that when he abandoned the family faith for Islam, his relationship with his parents ended. Homeless, he was helped by his local mosque in south-east London. He came to worship with us. I can remember the first day he came. Muslims generally, anywhere in the world, we are very pififul and very sympathetic with people who are I’1âWCOTT’IâI’S. The imam says it is now clear that the convert failed to grasp that his the religion did not advocate violence. Soon, he was on a more radical path. This was him at an event where the extremist is preacher Anjem Choudary was a speaker. He also posted controversial messages on Facebook and he wrote, but did not send, a letter to his estranged family. To mY letter to his estranged family. To my beloved parents, with the current situation in Iraq and Syria and neighbouring countries, my brothers and sisters are being raped, killed and tortured. It is a duty to help mY and tortured. It is a duty to help my brothers and sisters. Because I have no means of getting there, I will wage war against the British Government on this soil. That letter was found by police when they first moved in on Brusthom Ziamani. He was staying at a flat on this estate. In the weeks that followed, officers attempted to deradicalised him. His response was that it was too late. He was out on bail, but under surveillance when he was arrested with his weapons. It appeared he had no accomplice and the teenager, now convicted of terrorism, was a lone wolf. He will be sentenced next month. RAF jets were scrambled yesterday when two Russian military bombers were seen off the coast of Cornwall, though the aircraft didn’t enter UK airspace. It comes as the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned there was a real and present danger that Moscow could repeat tactics used to destabilise Ukraine against the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Moscow has reacted to his comments with fury. Our Diplomatic Correspondent james Robbins reports. For months, Russian bombers have been probing Britain’s air defences. This is video from one of those Russian aircraft as what appeared to be RAF Typhoons and other Nato aircraft come very close to shadow them. This is not yesterday’s incident off the Cornish coast, but does illustrate what’s happening with increasing frequency. It’s part of what the Defence Secretary was complaining about when he accused Russia of threatening Nato’s three Baltic states. Michael Fallon called Russia’s president a real and present danger, saying. .. The Prime Minister also sees Russia as a long-term threat, but was more dismissive of their pressure in the air. I think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fastjets, the pilots, the systems in place, to protect the United Kingdom. I suspect what’s happening here is the Russians are trying to make some sort of a point and I don’t think we should dignify it with too much of a response. But Michael Fallon also talked about Nato getting ready - staging exercises, building up rapid reaction forces in the Baltic states. The alliance is committed to defend any member state under its basic all-for-one principle. So there’s no doubting the tensions between Russia and the West, with each side suspicious that the other poses a threat. Russia faces 26 Nato countries on this side of the Atlantic, from Iceland to Turkey, in their military alliance with the United States and Canada. The real tension is over these three Nato members. The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, independent of Moscow since the Soviet empire collapsed 25 years ago. All have Russian speaking minorities who would like closer ties to Moscow. In Estonia, they make up 24% of the population. In Latvia, it’sjust over a quarter. But Russia says there is no cause for alarm about what’s happening in Ukraine or the Russian flights close to British airspace. The Russian Air Force is just returning back to the previous practices of regular training flights in international airspace. Compared to the number of flights by Royal Air Force and other Nato air forces, the number is minuscule. Conflict in Ukraine is not widely seen as a prelude to such direct military action in the Baltic states, but everything does point to a far more assertive and unpredictable Russia. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories: Chelsea Football Club has suspended three supporters from its home ground as it investigates a racist incident involving its fans in Paris on Tuesday. Footage shows a black man being repeatedly pushed off a train full of Chelsea fans singing racist songs. The club says it will ban them for life if there’s enough evidence. Nottinghamshire Police say there are more than 150 potential suspects in their investigation into alleged historical abuse at children’s homes. Detectives are investigating claims of abuse at 13 children’s homes over a lIo-year period. Meanwhile, a former social worker has told the BBC that abuse in the past was not properly investigated. Police Scotland has admitted it has lost 20,000 stop and search records from last year because of a computer programming mistake. Recently the force had to apologise for giving out incorrect information to the police watchdog on its stop and search statistics, and there’s been controversy over who is searched. Officers are currently trying to recover the lost data. A serving British soldier is believed to have travelled to the Middle East to fight against Islamic State. The man, understood to be 19, reportedly left his base after telling his family he wasjoining the Kurdish Peshmerga in their battle against the extremist group. Our Security Correspondent Gordon Corera is here with me now. What more do you know? The Ministry of Defence will only say they are investigating what’s happened to this 19-year-old, who hasn’t been named for his own safety. What’s happened to him in terms of this apparent disappearance from his base in Sciver press. According to reports, he’s contacted his family to say he’s trying to get to Iraq to fight against Islamic state, with the Kurds against Isis. He wouldn’t be the first Briton to have done that. Even some former soldiers have done that, but he would be the first serving soldier we know of who has gone out there to fight. Technically he is not absent without leave because he is due to be on leave at the moment, we understand. But if he’s not back by the time his leave period is due to finish, he could be in a lot of trouble with the military authorities and either way it looks like he will have a lot of questions to answer. Falling oil prices and warmer weather have led to a big drop in profits for the owner of British Gas - Centrica. The energy giant said full year profits fell by 35% to £1.75 billion. Centrica says payments to shareholders will be cut, which could hit pension funds. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, reports. Nobody wants to wake up to a chilly home... And nobody wants to wake up to a chilly forecast for a business either, but that was the case for Centrica today, which saw profits down by more than a third. After criticisms that the business made too much money, this morning the share price sank as investors feared it was now making too little. When I met Iain Conn, the new Chief Executive, I asked him how tough the energy market was. We’ve seen falling oil and gas prices, which have impacted our North Sea business significantly. Secondly, we have seen weather patterns which have been very unusual. The warm weather last year helped our customers, and I am delighted for them, but the volume of gas we sold was down and that impacted our profits. He said British Gas had done all it could to cut bills, but customers like Pamela johnson said the worst of the winter would be over before the price cuts took effect. Everybody wants cheaper gas, particularly over the winter time, when it is going to be... You need so much gas for your heating. Centrica’s problems go far beyond the issue of bills. North Sea investment will be cut by 40%. The income to investors, the dividend, will fall by 30% and Centrica announced it was closing two power stations, raising questions about the UK’s energy supply. In one year, a lot has changed. Oil prices and gas prices have halved. We have a lot of political pressure. The retail business is under investigation and we have general elections coming. Energy has long been a political football, since the Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband made this commitment in 2013. The next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017. The Conservatives retaliated, saying Labour’s policy would make companies nervous about cutting bills before the election. We don’t set prices for political reasons, we very much set prices to win customers and retain them. But he is sceptical about politicians involving themselves in pricing. I don’t personally believe it is always a good idea to intervene in markets, it can have unintended consequences and Britain has one of the most competitive energy markets in the world. Despite all the uncertainty, Mr Conn said there was no immediate threat tojobs. But Centrica will be announcing the results of a business review in the summer, where cuts could be revealed. Iraq’s security forces have finally managed to push back Islamic State fighters who’d taken control of vast areas north of Baghdad. But to do so, the security forces have joined forces with Shia militia who have been accused of killing civilians in towns that Islamic State used to control. Our world affairs editor, john Simpson, went with the fighters to Mansouriya, in Diyala province, to see what has been happening on the ground. The outskirts of Baghdad. We’re heading out through the gateway, out northwards into Diyala province. Three weeks ago, for us as Westerners to have made this journey would have been suicidal. Islamic State controlled most of Diyala then. We’re being escorted by civilian volunteers from the Badr Brigade. Shia fighters like these are now being rebranded as part of a new force and they’ve helped to clear IS out of the entire province. Close to the village of Mansouriya, 100 kilometres north of Baghdad, you can see the after-effects of the IS occupation. These shops were owned by Shia Muslims. This is ethnic cleansing Iraq style. IS regards the Shia as heretics and it killed them or chased them away. Mansouriya has become a ghost town, littered with hundreds of booby-trap bombs. This shows very clearly how dangerous Islamic State still is, even though its forces have now pulled back something like 70 kilometres from here. This bomb went offjust this morning and it hit a car as it was driving past. Three people were injured and one person died. There are bombs all along this road and some of them are still live. You can perhaps see there’s a plastic can up there, green plastic can. It’s all wired up - it could well go off at any moment. The IS fighters who were here were highly motivated, but they were no match for well-trained and properly equipped soldiers. At first, when IS attacked last year, the Iraqi army panicked. It was only when Shia religious leaders called for volunteers to help the Army that the situation stabilised. Now, at a camp near Mansouriya, the volunteers, regardless of background, are being integrated into a single force against IS, or Daesh, as it’s called here. TRANSLATION: We don’t have any problems. We havejust one enemy, Daesh. There is no difference between Sunni and Shia. TRANSLATION: We think this training course has a very important part to play in bringing people together and standing against terrorism. But there is a worrying side to all this. Allegations have surfaced of Shia fighters killing Sunnis who sympathise with Islamic State. The government says it’s investigating and will show zero tolerance. Islamic State can only be defeated fully if sectarianism itself can be stamped out here. The shortage of new homes across England has worsened, according to the latest set of house building figures. Critics say successive governments have failed to get to grips with the housing crisis and that it’s still significantly short of what is needed. Our home editor, Mark Easton, reports. England’s housing crisis deepened today with figures showing the number of new homes started in the last quarter of last year was 9% down on the same period a year earlier. And despite the Prime Minister’s pledge to get Britain building again, the number of homes completed fell far short of what experts say is required. We are not even building half the number of homes we actually need. If you look at starts in future years, it is going down even more. What that means is we are potentially going to fail future generations, who are not going to have homes they can afford to rent and buy and to live in. Planners say England needs 245,000 new homes each year from 2011-2031, as population rises. Last year sawjust 118,700 houses completed. The shortfall now more than half a million homes. The problem is most acute in the capital, where official figures this week showed the average house now costs more than £500,000 and average rent is over £1,600 a month. A lack of affordable housing should be the top priority at the election, according to London’s Chamber of Commerce. 42% of employers in the capital say that housing costs mean it is now a struggle to recruit and retain skilled workers. This tiny one bed inner London flat was built on the understanding it would only be sold to local people on moderate incomes. Councils working with developers to find solutions to the affordable housing shortage. We have floor to ceiling windows in our apartments, to maximise the light. The company behind this high density development say they are massively oversubscribed. Pocket has an embarrassingly large database now, registered database with people that want to buy these homes. We have well over 17,000, and I have to say, at the end of this interview there will probably be another 500 people who have registered, because we cannot build them fast enough. Video blogger Tim Lowe set himself the challenge of living in central London for under £500 per month, including bills. There is actually something nice about going back to basics in a way. Solutions include an empty barge. This is our kind of kitchen area here. A commune... It has this quite familiar smell about it. And a horse box. It is actually very snug at night. I got back from work one day and wanted a bit of peace and quiet, run a nice warm bath. And there I was washing myself with a cold bucket of water. That definitely was not a highlight for me. The Government claims it inherited a broken housing market and describes today’s figures as the best since the economic crash. But demand for homes looks certain to outstrip supply for the whole of the next Parliament, whoever wins the election. It was nearly thrown in a skip - this cat’s head was found in a cottage in Cornwall after the owner died. And what was first thought to be a bit ofjunk turned out to be a 2,500-year-old ancient Egyptian bronze. And a valuable one at that. It sold at auction today for £52,000. So how did it end up in Cornwall? jon Kay reports. This is the story of an old lady with a cat, but Doreen Liddell had no idea just how special her cat really was. When the great-grandmother died last year at the age of 95, relatives were clearing out her Cornish cottage, and were about to throw out what they thought was a piece of ornamentaljunk. That junk was in fact a rare artefact from Ancient Egypt. A bronze statue, which once contained the mummified remains of a cat. Spotted just in time, and saved from the bin by a local auctioneer. There was a skip outside the property, it could have gone in the skip. They thought it was nothing. And look at it now. No wonder he is cheery. Selling now at £52,000. Today the statue was bought by an anonymous phone bidder, believed to be an international dealer. The cat has been authenticated by experts, but how did it get to Cornwall? Doreen Liddell’s late husband did have business links to Howard Carter, the famous archaeologist, who excavated the tomb of Tutankhamen. The fact it might have belonged to Howard Carter gives it that provenance, thatjust makes it that much more valuable. I wish I had known - I would have stroked it every day! Doreen Liddell’s family do not want to be identified, but her friends say she would have been amazed. Did she like cats? No, no, not at all. just dogs, that’s all she ever had, as far as we know, in all the time we’ve been here. Real dogs? Chihuahuas. If you can call them that, yes! So what next for the Cornish cat? First stop, London, and the specialist dealer who has bought it. Then it will probably go on to the international art market. ",,
132,BBC1 London,19-feb-2015,BBC London News,22:25,20 mins,True,"on a French train. Tonight we hear from the victim. TRANSLATION: I was alone, I didn’t come to fight, I was just trying to get home. Ifigured it was because of the colour of my skin. Also tonight, after another cyclist is killed in London, there are renewed calls for restrictions on large trucks. And the art of complaining - why social media is the best way to get your commuter woes heard. Plus, is there more rain on the way? Your local and national weather’s coming up. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Alice Bhandhukravi. Three football fans suspected of racially abusing and pushing a black man off a Paris train have been suspended by Chelsea. They were apparently part of a group caught on film chanting racial abuse after a game on Tuesday night. The victim has expressed disbelief at the way he was treated and has called for the police to punish the perpetrators. Sara Orchard reports. These pictures of Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro have now been watched across the world. As a black man tries to board the train, he is pushed back by the fans, who are heard to sing... Two days on, and the victim has spoken to Le Parisien newspaper. TRANSLATION: I was alone, I didn’t come to fight. I was just trying to get home. Ifigured it was because of the colour of my skin. You know in France, black people have always been targeted for the colour of their skin, regardless of their background. With the story fixed firmly in the public eye, some Chelsea fans are unsure of their reception on Saturday’s home match with Burnley. Most Chelsea supporters are getting their tin hats on to deal with a swarm of media, journalists, descending on Stamford Bridge to make the most of the story. The majority of Chelsea supporters are very upset that their names are being tarnished. Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey is the only black Premier League manager and doesn’t believe Chelsea Football Club are to blame. I’ve been saying for a long time that these are really social issues that really manifest themselves in the football world. It would be good to see what the authorities are going to do. It’s standard procedure that for a European cup match of this nature, involving a London club, a group of Metropolitan Police officers would be invited out - on this occasion, by the French police. Speaking to The Met today, they confirmed to BBC London that the officers that were in Paris for Tuesday night’s game have all returned to London now. They are working on the case, going through the footage with the help of Chelsea Football Club and the French police, to try to identify those involved. Tonight, Chelsea confirmed that, following investigations, they have suspended three people from Stamford Bridge and have not ruled out banning orders. A club statement read: Having made an official complaint to French police, Souleymane also told the newspaper those involved should be punished and locked up. Anyone convicted could face a prison term of up to three years and a fine of up to £33,000. After another cycling death in the capital there are renewed calls for curbs on large vehicles being driven in London. Today’s victim died when she collided with a tipper truck in Victoria this morning. The 30-year-old woman is the fourth cyclist to have been killed this year. Now campaigners want better safety measures introduced, as Louisa Preston reports. The horribly familiar scene, a London Road cordoned off a London road cordoned off while police investigate the death of a cyclist. The woman, in her 30s, was hit by a lorry near this construction site in Victoria during this morning’s rush hour. Witnesses said she was riding a Boris Bike which was crushed under the wheels of a tipper truck and she died at the scene. Her death is the fourth this year involving a lorry. Campaigners say action is urgently needed to make London’s roads safer. We believe that these trucks are unfit for purpose. They are designed as off-road vehicles and they work on construction sites, with waste materials. There should be a safer design of lorries in London. We have put a challenge to the construction industry to have safer lorries, where the driver is more down low, where the driver’s line of sight is where the people, the cyclists, pedestrians are. TfL said today that making the roads safer for cyclists is a top priority for them. They say they are spending £1 billion on improving the existing cycle superhighways. This death comes in the same week as police officers are patrolling junctions across the capital, talking to all road users about their behaviour. Louisa joins me now. Where do we go from here? Cycling in the capital is at record levels. Figures from transport for London last month show that cycling has grown by 10% in last year. It actually says that bicycles make up 16% of all traffic in the capital. At peak times, it rises to 25%. That’s pretty interesting figures. It adds more pressure, when we hear about another death today, which makes four this year, all involving lorries. There are many questions being raised. We heard there are calls for curbs on lorries? You might remember the safety around cycling came to the fore in 2011+, when there were six deaths in four weeks. There were calls for Boris johnson deaths in four weeks. There were calls for Borisjohnson to ban lorries from roads at peak times. At the time he said it would affect the economy. He is now saying that lorries without safety equipment on board are to be effectively banned from London streets. That is coming into force at the beginning of September. We know that Boris johnson is ploughing hundreds of millions of pounds into cyclists. He is creating lots of cycle superhighways, as we know. They have been very successful in Copenhagen. It’s just been very successful in Copenhagen. It’sjust a It’s just a matter of waiting to see if they are that successful in London with the volume of traffic we have on the roads. Next, the amount of food Londoners are throwing away and the calls for more to be done to encourage us to recycle our food waste. A report from the London Assembly has found that only half of all households in the capital are able to recycle food waste - and that our landfill sites will be full up in ten years time. So, what can be done? Our political correspondent Karl Mercer reports. It’s not exactly a pretty sight, but tucked just outside the M25 is a plant that is turning London’s waste into energy and fertiliser. It’s coming from Croydon, it’s coming from various dust carts from Runnymede and from Woking. We have roughly about 1+0 tonnes of food waste there at the moment. In technical speak, it’s an anaerobic digestive system. Charlie Berridge puts it more simply. Like a giant cow. If you imagine, we have five 1+500 tonne tanks, each eight metres tall. What they are doing as they hold the material and we feed from one tank to the next, to the next and so on. This is what can happen. The London Assembly says not enough is actually happening. Its environment committee says 23 London boroughs do collect food waste. But 16 of them offer none for flats. That means half of London’s households don’t recycle their waste food. Less than half of London is currently have access to a separate food waste collection. That means that 20% of all the waste we throw away into landfill is currently food waste. It’s one area where, clearly, the boroughs and the Mayor can do something to improve our recycling rates quite substantially. This project in King’s Cross shows how it can be done on a small scale. Bikes collect food waste from local factories. Then they feed it into a mini anaerobic digester. The fertiliser on gas and go back to the local firms, a model they think and work across the capital. think can work across the capital. Could be having lots more of these micro-digesters around, and reducing the amount of waste that travels out of the cities to be processed. You are reducing the waste miles, you are reducing emissions. You are creating local employment in the process. That really is one of our main goals, is that. While London is getting better at recycling its food waste, some campaigners believe the message of wasting food in the first place needs to be clearer. The food waste bin in your homes, at the bottom of your building, wherever it is, is for banana skins, not bananas. It is for apple cores, not apples. Eat the apple and then put the core in the bin. It’s actually common sense. For now, though, around 60 tonnes of London’s food waste will continue to come to this planned in Surrey every year. How often have you been left wanted to complain after a nightmare commute, but not wanting to spend time writing an e-mail or making a call? New research suggests it can all be done by taking 11+0 characters on social media. When things go wrong on the trains, it seems many of us now vent our frustrations online. According to a recent study, over the past year, nearly 1.8 million tweets have been pinged at the rail companies that take us in and out of the capital. 280,000 concerned delays. 70,000 were about cancellations. And 62,000 were complaints of overcrowding. First Great Western generated the most number of tweets about delays, while Southern came top with complaints of cancellations. What we do is we look at all the tweets coming into the main operators serving London. The research was done by data analysts Commute London. We certainly found at First Great Western, Greater Anglia and Virgin with the most popular, and most used in terms of tweets. There is a mix of satisfaction in their, some very good, some much more mixed. The South London operators, which have experienced a lot of problems at the moment, tend to fare worse than some of the longer distance operators. Social media expert Will Francis believes this public expression of dissatisfaction is really putting pressure on all sorts of companies. The question is whether we will actually see change as a result of that, and if that power will translate into change. The indications are that it will. Because these companies are being held more publicly to account, to provide the service they say they’ll provide. It’s difficult to obtain figures from these private companies about how much investment they are putting into technology such as Twitter. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail and police, told the BBC its operators have embraced social media, so when things do go wrong, they can give passengers the latest travel information, and help answer queries quickly. But not all train passengers we spoke to use social media to contact those in charge. I would probably phone them up or send them an e-mail, I should think. I feel like they’ve got a team there that they are paying to have customer relations with, so you know you will get a response. It feels like a much quicker way of actually getting a response as well. I would probably go and talk to somebody in person. Yes. No. Why? I don’t know how to use it, actually, to be quite honest! So, whether you use Twitter or not, it is hoped by many that the technology we have the help redress the balance of power for the commuter. That’s it, it’s goodnight from me and I’ll leave you with Stav Danaos who has the weather. A grotty day across the capital today. Lots of rain around, sporadic at times and drier interludes. Tomorrow, another fairly cloudy day, rather chilly with a threat of rain returning. A bit of uncertainty. There is the weather that brought today’s wet weather. This feature across the South may return northwards through the course of Friday to bring yet more rain. We start Friday on a dry note. There will be some hazy sunshine across the capital, generally. It does look like the rain, the uncertainty to the northern extent, it will move towards the North as the afternoon goes on. Looking at fairly chilly days as well. As we head towards the weekend, the start of the weekend, it will be a bright day, particularly Saturday. Lots of sunshine, passing showers that could be wintry. A chilly day to come. As we had to Sunday, it’s looking much wet and windy. Good evening, Question Time is coming up next. To get you in the mood, maybe you have a question for me? What is the weekend going to be like? Some rain, some sun and a little bit of snow for some of us. The thickest cloud has been across southern areas. That rain is still there, lingering well into the night, reluctant to clear away in the south-east all night long. Clear skies further north and west. It is chilly with wintry showers across the Highlands of Scotland. Even lower down, where the showers are falling as rain, I seen a surround, across parts of western Scotland, Northern Ireland, maybe partnering on. -- Northern Ireland, maybe partnering on. -- iciness around. Sunny weather to start the day across central areas. This is eight o’clock. To the south coast, a shield of cloud. That rain is still lurking close to the channel coast. The question is, how far north is that rain going to extend back western market looks like it’s a line from Dorset was the Thames Estuary. To the south of that, damp weather. The rain could extend further northwards. Many places will stay bright through the day, with sunshine further north you go. Furtherwintry day, with sunshine further north you go. Further wintry showers, especially for the Highlands of Scotland. Falling on quite low levels as colder air comes in. Sixes and sevens on the best of the sunshine. It will then chilly tomorrow night. Wintry showers and iciness around and even in southern areas. The showers will keep going as we go into Saturday, pushed by a brisk wind. Quite a lot of snow, potentially, across western Scotland. There will be some sunshine and some places will avoid most of the showers and stay bright and breezy. Despite the sunshine, it will not feel warm out there. As we go into Saturday night, temperatures will fall away quite sharply. Many of us will wake up to a widespread frost on Sunday morning. Already, a shield of cloud coming across the sky. The next low-pressure system will be whistling in from the Atlantic. It will soon be spreading wintry weather into western parts of the UK. After a wintry weather into western parts of the UK. Aftera bright the UK. After a bright dawn in the East, it will turn increasingly windy and wet. A period of snow over the high ground of northern Britain. For most of us, plain old wet and ",,
133,BBC1 London,21-feb-2015,Joins BBC News,02:10,230 mins,True,"A period of snow for Northern Ireland briefly, but more significantly, up over the higher ground of Scotland and Northern England and even at some low levels for a time you could see a period of snowfall. So we’ll keep an eye on that. A raw and pretty wintry start to the day here. It’ll be rain further South across much of Wales and Southwest England, thoroughly wet and windy. This is lunchtime, and still some brightness hanging on across some Eastern counties of England into the early afternoon, but eventually the rain will win out. A wet and windy end to the day for many. It will take all day to reach Easternmost counties, and still some snow hanging on up over the high ground of Central and Northern Scotland in particular. It’s bound to feel cold here, three or four degrees, but briefly, you’ll notice, it does turn milder across the far Southwest. But it turns colder again on Monday, chilly winds coming in from the West or the Southwest, with further wintry showers across Northern and Western parts of the UK. Some sunshine, but with very strong, blustery winds it won’t feel warm. Gales possible, and that’s the case on Tuesday. Northwesterly winds. The distribution of the showers will vary from day to day, but the main theme is it’ll be cold, it’ll be showery, it’ll be windy. And then on Wednesday, more weather fronts come in off the Atlantic, and it’s Northern parts of the UK which will see most of the rain. Further South, not much, and it will turn milder at least for a time through the middle part of the week. So, why is the weather so lively? Well, as I mentioned at the start, the culprit is in North America, and of course it’s been so cold recently, with widespread snowfall, a deep plunge of cold air from the Arctic, and that’s tightened the thermal gradient between the cold and the warm, and it’s the thermal gradient which drives the jet stream. And because that cold air has been so cold, it’s supercharged the jet stream over on the Western side of the Atlantic. It’s100mph stronger than it would normally be. And because the jet stream is so strong coming across the Atlantic, that invigorates the low pressure systems that whistle across in our direction. And that’s why the weather is going to continue to be so unsettled through to the end of February, with periods of wet and windy weather, some brighter intervals before the next low pressure system comes in delivering more wind and rain and always with the threat of some snow, particularly in the North. As we end the month, it will be wettest in the North, always quite chilly, I think, in the wind. just the hint that as we go into March, the weather might begin to settle down as the jet stream slows down. There is exploded ammunition everywhere and mine s that need to be got rid of. We move into Debaltseve and the shelling has taken its toll. The town is very quiet. This is the central street in Debaltseve and as you can see it is practically deserted apart from some civilians and some soldiers. This town has not had gas, water or electricity since the New Year. Many people are still living underground and are afraid to come out. We can still hear the sound of occasional fire. This part of Debaltseve is a bit of a ghost town. I think you can see it on my face. We were notjust scared we were in complete shock. Imagine my child, she is scared of everything now. After weeks of living underground, this man has comeback to check on his modest house. A shell exploded outside. His neighbour said they are tired of replacing broken windows. Everything is ruined. The Ukrainian National Guard hit us with shells. Who do you blame for all this destruction? He is clear that it is all the fault of the President of Ukraine. On the road out of Debaltseve, some of the men are leaving with theirjob done. They are confident, but having won will the leaders now agree to stop shooting or have they already decided on the next target? Stay with us on BBC News, still to come: The search for three missing London schoolgirls, feared to be heading to Syria tojoin the terror group Islamic State. Police appeal for them to return home. First, let’s round up the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The Financial Times reports on what they call the ‘11th hour deal’ between Greece and the Eurozone to extend the country’s 172 billion euro rescue programme for four months. In France, Le Figaro reports a state of emergency in France after 2 million people contract a particularly virulent seasonal flu this year. The Irish Times has a story on Dublin’s property bubble - saying the recent crash isjust one of many booms and busts in the last 300 years - and not even close to being the worst. The Straits Times reports on plans of a new offensive to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State militants. The International New York Times headline reads, ""Boom in China The paper says the country’s huge economic growth that’s created opportunities for women has also fostered a return to traditional values. This is BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. The latest headlines: A fire has broken out at the 79-floor Marina Torch Tower in Dubai. Authorities say there are no reports of casualties - hundreds have been evacuated. Eurozone finance ministers have reached an agreement with Greece to extend the country’s bailout deal for four months, to allow time for a review of its austerity measures. Police have issued an urgent appeal for help in finding three schoolgirls from east London who are believed to be trying to joinjihadists fighting in Syria. The three teenagers flew to Turkey on Tuesday without telling their families. Scotland Yard detectives say they consider the girls to be ""extremely vulnerable| Daniel Sandford has more. Filmed by CCTV cameras at Gatwick Airport as they left Britain on Tuesday morning, three teenage girls - all friends and all in the same year at school. Shamima Begum isjust15, but could be on her way tojoin the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. With her is a 16-year-old friend called Kadiza Sultana. Both are British Bangladeshis and both are successful at school, as was the third friend, who is also 15, and whose family don’t want to be identified. Counterterrorism officers are appealing for them to phone home or to contact the police in Turkey. We are concerned they will go into Syria where, of course, they could be connected with Islamic State, and we are all aware of the treatment of girls and women in that part of Syria. The friends all went to this school, the Bethnal Green academy in London, rated outstanding by Ofsted. This week it’s half term. The girls left their homes early on Tuesday morning, lying to their parents about their plans. At debate which can they boarded a Turkish to Syria. I thought that, first of all, it was are off to Syria. But I still don’t believe that they’re going anywhere other than a holiday, because this is how they were dressed and this is how they looked and this is how they packed. Luckily for British police, Turkey is being plagued by savage winter weather and travel chaos, so detectives winter weather and travel chaos, so detectives are hoping the three schoolgirls haven’t yet made it to the Syrian border. This is the first time that Scotland Yard has gone public with the names of teenage girls who have travelled to Syria. It is a sign of how concerned they are about the girls’ safety and how worried they are about the growing phenomenon of jihadi brides. It’s thought that more than 50 British women and hundreds from other Western European countries have already travelled to join Islamic State. Many of them are still of school age. Some are encouraged to go there by other women, who have already made the journey. There’s women who are at the forefront of trying to recruit young girls but there’s also men, olderjihadi men, who are befriending these girls on certain sites likejihadi match-maker and sites like jihadi match-maker and other websites sites likejihadi match-maker and other websites and social media sites and encouraging young girls, befriending them, and doing similar - behaving in a similar way to the way child sexual exploiter groomers behave, actually. Tonight, the families of the three girls are said to be desperate - families of the three girls are said to be desperate - still hoping somebody will stop their daughters crossing the border into Syria, and into the dangerous world of the Islamic State. A double suicide attack on a hotel in the Somalian capital, Mogadishu, has killed at least 10 people. The deputy prime minister and two other members of the government were among those wounded. The militant group Al-Shabaab said it carried out the attack. Mary Harper reports. The attack on Central Hotel happened at prayer time. Among the dead, Mogadishu’s deputy mayor and two MPs. The Deputy Prime Minister was wounded along with more than 30 others. One suicide bomber blew him self up in the hotel’s prayer room. The government officials were worshipping there. Another blew up a car packed with explosives, which he had parked directly outside of the room. TRANSLATION: The explosion was so huge it shook the whole surroundings. I saw several people who were lying dead, and the scene is very ugly, with blood, and flesh everywhere. It is attacks like this that make it difficult for Mogadishu to recover from more than two decades of war. Islamist group Al-Shabaab withdrew from the city in 2011 but continues to terrify the people. The hotel attack happened near the seat of government, and home to the president. The militants phoned me to say attacked the officials because they were non-believers working for a Western backed government. The group threatens not only Somalia but the wider region. It has links with Al-Qaeda. It is estimated to have between 7000 and 9000 members. Al-Shabaab is behind the attack on Nairobi’s Westgate shopping centre in 2013. A military offensive launched last year by African Union forces and Somali government troops has succeeded in driving out Al-Shabaab from most towns. But the group still controls huge parts of the country. And is able to strike right at the heart of government. It’s a night of films, frocks and gushing speeches - and this year’s Oscars on Sunday are sure to live up to expectations. But how much of the awards are based on actual performance? Our Arts Editor, Will Gompertz, has been looking at the lobbying behind the scenes. The glitz and glamour of the film awards season is about to reach its climax. This is the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where on Sunday night film stars and movie moguls will arrive via this soon-to-be-revealed red carpet to find out to whom the 6000 plus Academy members have decided to award an Oscar. It will bring to an end months of campaigning by producers to make sure their film has had the best possible chance of winning. Obviously they are not allowed to bribe Academy members but some behind-the-scenes lobbying can get close to that mark. There are screenings and dinners and informal get-togethers. But the Academy tries to control that as much as possible in this phase of the voting. OK, tt tries but it doesn’t always succeed as this veteran Hollywood producer admits. There is some wining and dining but they have actually stopped that, I wouldn’t say completely, but there is less of it and it is people who will basically screen a movie at their house. I saw one of the movies that way. If you reverse time, then the universe gets smaller. So the tactics have become more subtle. Competing film should be viewed in impartial surroundings which you could argue is difficult to achieve if one of the stars is hanging about before the screening. That is exactly what happened and I happened to like the movie and Eddie Redmayne wasn’t in the room when I saw it. The fact is, I don’t know that I would have said anything different than what I said or felt. I have been called all sorts of things over the years, Sultan of Swag, Gift Guru, but ultimately I am a simple guy who loves hooking up celebrities with incredible products that I loved. more than matched by international I think the misperception about celebrities is that there are too rich and famous to care about getting gift and the reality is that you are never too rich or famous to enjoy a gift, receiving or giving. And that is the way many of them shop. These are the unofficial £125,000 consolation goody bags that will be given to the stars who go home without a golden statue. Everyone is a winner at the Oscars proving there really is no business like show business. A fire has broken out at a high-rise tower in Dubai. The blaze was on the upper floors of a 79-storey residential building called ""The Torch"". It is now being brought under control. Flames stretched up the tower, with debris falling to the ground. There’s plenty more on our BBC News website. The weekend is nearly upon us and it is looking decidedly chilly but Saturday is looking like the best day of the week in regards to the amount of sunshine. There will be wintry showers in the forecast with long spells of sunshine in southern and eastern areas and on Sunday it will be a cold and frosty start coming with and windy through the course of the day with snow falling over high ground in the north. For tonight it looks like it will stay pretty cool. Where we have showers across northern and western areas there is a significant risk of ice towards the end of the night. These are towns and city temperatures lower than this particularly in the north. This is the big picture. North-easterly winds bringing in a feed of showers, this weather front may enhance showers across Scotland through the course of Saturday but there will be a good deal of dry and bright weather as well. So a cold start for most places. Variable amounts of showers, a few cloud and sunny spells. Through the day we will continue to see a few showers across northern and western areas, wintry over the higher ground and showers getting into southern and eastern areas as well, some of them may contain a mixture of hail as well. Sunny spells in dween but feeling chillilash temperatures 4-7 celsius. A cold night and on Saturday morning, most of us waking UP Saturday morning, most of us waking up to a frost. But it will be bring in southern and eastern parts of the UK. Skies turn cloudier across the west, as this weather system moves in, outbreaks of rain and winds as well. Significant snow falling over the higher ground as that rain bumps into the cold air. Accumulations of snow likely across the high ground of Scotland, particularly across the Highlands and in towards the southern uplands and snow down to lower levels for a time in the heaviest of the rain. Snow falls over the higher ground of northern England and maybe Wales as well. Winds moving strong across Irish Sea coastal areas and heavy rain pushing in there. But the Midlands eastwards having a fine morning with plenty of sunshine after that cold start. It looks like we’ll hold on to the brightness across the extreme south-east of England until later on in the afternoon, when the skies turn cloudy, and that rain arrives as well. But out west it will be blustery, heavy rain continuing, and those winds quite a feature, particularly in Northern Ireland in towards western Scotland and Wales. And feeling quite cold and raw. As we head on in towards Monday, you can see tightly packed isobars pushing in off the Atlantic and the blue colours indicating we will stay on the chilly side and all the weather fronts denoting showers. So it will stay unsettled into the start of next week, but general some showers and also sunshine on the cards, too. ~ The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. One of the tallest residential buildings in the world, the 79 floor, Marina Torch tower in Dubai has caught fire. Flames are stretching from around the fiftieth floor high up into the building. It has now been brought under control. The building is more than 300 metres tall. There are no reports of any casualties. After a day of crisis talks, Eurozone finance ministers have granted Greece a conditional four-month extension of its international bailout. The deal means Greece will stay in the eurozone for now, and will not run out of money next week. The Greek finance minister calls it a mutually beneficial agreement. The leaders of France and Germany have renewed calls for a full implementation of the ceasefire deal they helped negotiate for eastern Ukraine. The calls come amid continuing breaches of the truce in several cities and towns, including Mariupol, Donetsk and the Now on BBC News it’s time ""The police are here to do us more harm than good"" - that is what my guest today said after Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager, was shot by a white policemen in Ferguson, Missouri. He is the rapper Tef Poe and was a leading figure in the protest following the killing. He described what the police did as a declaration of war. He said, "" my grandparents endured this type of treatment so we wouldn’t have to."" So, if you are young, black and poor in America today, are you at war with the police? Tef Poe, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you. Do you remember the moment when you heard about Michael Brown’s death and what happened? I was at home that day. It was a normal day for me. I was on tour, at that moment, and we had to lay over at home for the weekend. I was getting ready to go to a party me and my friends promote once a month - a hip-hop party. We were looking forward to the weekend. I woke up that morning, I had uploaded the flyer for the party to invite people on social media to the party, and in the process of doing that I scrolled down on my Instagram and I see a picture of Michael Brown’s stepfather, and he was holding a sign that said, ""my unarmed child has been murdered by Ferguson police."" Initially, I didn’t know how to feel about that. The look in his face and the pure distraught upon him made me freeze. Unfortunately in St Louis, police shootings in the black community are not an uncommon thing. So for quite sometime I sat there and I didn’t really move. I wasn’t really galvanised enough to leave the house or run into the streets. I didn’t look at the phone and said, ""oh my God, we have to go."" What happened was I sat there and different people in my social media universe began to talk about this. Almost everyone in my feed was talking about it simultaneously. And I live with my manager and said ""the cops have shot this 17-year-old kid in Ferguson. What’s going on?"" There was a moment when you decided you had to go out on the streets? I stayed inside for two hours. His body was on the street for 4.5 hours. You have 4.5 hours of people are on social media describing a body in the middle of the street after the police have just shot him. At a certain point I go, ""OK, this is crazy."" A friend of mine, Kayla, eventually came to pick us up and my friend, j Stretch, we all went to Ferguson. We got to the scene, people were in the streets. Something irregular that I noticed was that each and every police precinct in the city was in Ferguson and that has never happened. Something like that typically wouldn’t happen unless there was maybe a terrorist threat or a natural disaster. I noticed the cops were everywhere from different municipalities, different types of cops. People were gathering, including yourself, and doing what? People were very emotional, a lot of people were crying, and people were discussing what happened with each other. The policeman shot and killed him. A grand jury decided it wasn’t a case, that it wasn’t murder, that it wasn’t manslaughter. You were arrested at the time of the protest. I was arrested in October as part of a... We organised a weekend of resistance, which was a national march and mobilisation. A weekend where young people came to St Louis of all ages and demographics and proceeded to protest. The killing was in August and there were various events. Why were you arrested? I was arrested in a Walmart with several other young organisers and activists. We did an action of solidarity forjohn Crawford in Ohio who was a young man who had a toy gun walking through Walmart talking on the phone to his girlfriend. The police gunned him down because they believed he had a real gun. What were you doing? We were walking around Walmart chanting- we had a sign that said ""toy guns don’t kill people."" Walmart called the police obviously. You expected be arrested. Yeah. You have been arrested before. Yeah, previously for petty things. In St Louis if you are young and black you have a warrant. I once lived in San Diego. I moved back home, and walking down the street with a friend of mine, police stop us in the middle of the street, they get out of a car with their guns out, throw us on the car, run my name and I have a transit warrant I had got when I was 16 from getting on the train and not paying. The problem is I have no problem going to jail for a warrant if it is illegitimate crime. And it is borne out about 13% of the whole population. This event, the killing of Michael Brown, obviously had a profound effect on you and you have now... You are part of a campaign to change things. Did you think before... what were your feelings of how unfair life was if you were young, black and poor living in the States? I never quite thought about what that represents nationally or globally prior to the killing of Michael Brown, prior to the uprising in Ferguson. I never really reflected upon it. What I did reflect upon was what it meant for me to be young, black and poor from St Louis. I never thought about my global place or my national place. I can only relate to my immediate world, which was St Louis, Missouri. What that means is that we live in a very unbalanced and unequal state of living. We don’t have the same opportunities for inclusion as other people. I like to describe it as - we are not being allowed to fully participate in society, we are not allowed to fully opt into American culture. That is because you are black? Not only because we are black, it’s because we are black and WE BFE pooI’. I believe that my city is a very segregated city. Missouri was the last state to free the slaves. The culture of Missouri reflects the fact that it was the last state to free the slaves. We accept this position that this is how things are and this is how it will always be. The best we can do is make it work. You have to play the cards you are dealt. People listening to you would say, you have equality legislation and a black president. There are ways to deal with this and states and people are doing that. The problem with racism in America is that for so long we have tried to handle this with legislative answers. We haven’t handled this with an emotional response. I was on a TV show with Claire McCaskill in America and she suggested that I run for Office, and that is part of the problem. When black people in America have a problem with racism, this is an issue of humanity, not legislation - an issue of compassion, not an issue of voters’ rights. One of the negligent areas of the civil rights movement is that we didn’t move the moral compass of racism to the right direction. We were concerned about the moral compass of black people. Martin Luther King remained non-violent, ""stay on the right side ofjustice, the right side of the law,"" but we, at that point in time, we had to explain our humanity to the oppressor. We are still trying to explain our humanity to people who don’t quite understand racism. You say what the civil rights movement was, it was non-violent and you have said, I don’t advocate non-violent protest. Are you saying something different is needed? I am an advocate of militant, direct action of non-violent protest, that’s totally different than non-violent protest. For so long we have stood outside the building and said, ""we are hungry can you feed us?"" We come back the next day, ""we are hungry, can we have some food?"" We know it is stockpiled. We come and hold hands and wrap arms around each other, we sing ours elves to death and we get no food. So now we present the option that says, we are going to be non-violent but what happens if we come to this building and say, ""give us food"" more aggressively? Does that mean... What happened in Ferguson was there was looting. Is that militant direct action? That has nothing to do with it. The community was puppeteered in the looting. That is a different subject. It is the fault of other people? Martin Luther King says a riot is the language of the unheard. When you kill a person in the community and you leave the body in the streets for 4.5 hours, if you do that in any other community, something would happen, I don’t know what would happen... Does thatjustify looting or criminality? No it does not at all and I don’t advocate that whatsoever. What I am saying is, for so long, black people in America are treated as if we don’t have emotions. And you leave a body in the middle of the street and you expect there to be zero emotional response. You expect people to kick up their feet and watch Greys Anatomy when there is a dead body in the pathway where children cross. Militant direct action that is non-violent - it is hard to understand what it means. What is militant direct action? Taking a firm, aggressive, direct stance against things like white supremacy, colonialism, imperialism, homophobia, even sexism - it’s taking a stance that says you don’t agree with this, this is wrong, ""I will not casually disagree with it, I will not casually..."" What does it mean, give us an example, it is hard to understand. It is more so about the attitude and the feel of it, it is more so about the desire to fight it constantly. It is not a passive... Fight it verbally? Yeah, fight it verbally. If you fight it physically, you don’t need guns, you don’t need to raise your fist. that, when you look at photos of Ferguson and you see people burning down buildings, you see people throwing rocks through glass. However, when you see the tanks come, and the M16s pointed at people’s faces, you don’t see the community go to the backyard, open the garage, and pull out another tank. When I describe being militant, we are still not quite... The term is more symbolic than militancy. Are you at war with the police? The police are at war with us. If we were legitimately at war with the police, we would be able to shoot back and fight back without being punished. All of this fair and love and war. They gun us down and... Our death are seen with... Have you spoken with local police in your area? You smile when I say that. We tried constantly to have a sincere and honest back-and-forth dialogue with the police. The police have fought very vigourously to cover up some of the wrongdoings. Once again... I take it back to the fact that a lot of us are not looking for a political response. We are looking for a sincere, opt into our humanity, an emotional response. You say it is the police and the police in this case of not seeing black people as human. Have you had a conversation with police people? You are one of the leading activists. I have had several meetings with police, several, black, white, you name it. A quarter of American police are black and you say they are as bad as white police? Correct. When we speak on things like white supremacy and we speak on things like colonialism and imperialism in America and the suppression and oppression of minorities, we don’t speak on these things from the stance of a racial stamnce, we speak on a sense from a systemic stance. Even if you have a president in the White House, it doesn’t matter if his skin colour is black because his allegiance is to the system. When Barack Obama speaks... It is the establishment. When you speak to the police, I want to know what you have said and heard. We asked him and said to them... You say, we, what about you? The community. I don’t represent myself when I am in these spaces. Tef Poe, have you spoken to another policeman and had a conversation where you treated them like a human being? Yeah, I have no other option. I can’t walk up to a police officer and do anything else. We speak to the police... I have spoken to the police from a stance of compassion. My involvement in this entire situation is from a stance of compassion and emotional empathy. What do they say to you? These conversations are deeply rooted in what the law allows them to do. They have a very robotic response. It is very difficult to crack through the shell of a police officer and to get them to have a conversation on a one-on-one basis where they speak to you as a person that understands what it’s like to go through these things. At the time of Ferguson, we had the likes of Reverend Al Sharpton and Reverend jesse jackson. .. And you smile, why? Ijust can’t... I wonder what you think, they are veterans of the civil rights movement, like your grandparents. They were involved and fought. Are they not making a difference now? I appreciate the work that they have done. I have spoken to Al Sharpton and jesse jackson. We, the young people of this generation, of this movement, once again, our goal is not to show up to the building and say, please let us in your building... That is what you say they are doing? The civil rights movement was more so about creating a movement that was solely set up for heterosexual black men to assume a place of leadership in the community and to possibly establish legislation and laws that would combat racism and discrimination. So, in many regards, the civil rights movement was very successful. But, for us, it did not deal with the fact that, OK, once you have a law against prejudice, you have a law against racism, that does not make the person sitting next to you any less racist. OK, so how do you tackle that? How do you, Tef Poe, change that person and their emotions, as you talk about it? I feel, if you want me to be very honest, it is not myjob to humanise myself to you. If you cannot look at another human being and see the humanity, if I can’t look at you and see this is a woman, a human being, flesh and bone, she has a heartbeat and is breathing, she has a spirit, soul, brain, family, people who care about her, she loves other people. We go through the same thing, self-doubt, we get discouraged, happy, feeljoy, anger, you have concerns for your family, future, you have a place in this world, you deserve to be here, you have a right to be here that I can’t take from you, I can’t give you that and I cannot snatch it back. I don’t have that right. If I can’t see that in you, then I feel that yourjob, OK, so those whites that you are blaming for the situation, they are at fault, and to listen to you, it is a whole swathe of American society? Well, I do not believe that they are at fault. Because even the whites that are racist in America, they are just tools for a greater agenda. Aren’t they the ones who don’t see you as a human being? They are, but I still have compassion, and love and care about them. I want the same things for me that they want. But what are they, the victims of a greater system? Yes, we are all tools of a greater agenda. And the way that we view ourselves. .. What agenda? Whose agenda ? The agenda of the top 1% of wealth in America. The agenda of people who benefit from... It’s a creed of people who benefit from people being racially discriminated against. There is a systemic way that the country operates and functions of off the ignorance of racism. The ignorance of segregation. But you look at the top 1%, do you include President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder? Are you including the likes of Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court? I’m including Barney the Dinosaur if he helps to perpetuate these things. Ido not look at Barack Obama and go, ""Barack, you are evil."" I don’t look at Eric Holder and say he is evil. I don’t agree with the things they have done, or the handling of the situation, but at the same time, once again, they are entrenched into a system, it is Barack Obama who is the President. Let me explain. How do you change the system? By building community. We change it by choosing to love ourselves more. by taking back was stolen from us during slavery. Planting history and heritage into the hearts of our children. Reclaiming our culture into our own people. Oprah Winfrey says, ""what I am looking for..."" she was saying this about Ferguson, ""is some kind of leadership to come out of this and say this is what we want, what has to change, these are the steps that we need to make these changes. This is what we are willing to do to get it."" That’s one of the criticisms. What are the steps? That was promotion for a movie. We have had demands up since week two, since Mike Brown was murdered on 14th August. So Oprah Winfrey is only coming along and saying this because she is promoting a movie? That’s me being sarcastic, but... Oprah Winfrey does not know anything about the political landscape of Ferguson or the Black Lives Matter movement. People say that we are looking for leadership. You can trust me, the United States government knows precisely who their key leadership is in this movement. You can trust that the media that chooses to demonise certain leaders on the ground, and the Ferguson police department, and the St Louis police department, Chief Dotson, Chiefjackson, they know exactly who the leadership is. Mayor Frances knows who the leadership is, when she says stuff like that, it is ridiculous. My friends at home have been targeted, arrested and thrown in jail blindly for almost nothing. But people like her go on TV and say there is no leadership. So, what is going to happen? You know, I don’t know, that is like asking me to predict what can happen after a 400-year... We are in a relationship that has been in effect for 400 years, and it’s a bad relationship. It is a horrible relationship. I have no idea what the relationship after this looks like. If you are in a relationship with a person who abuses you and cheats on you and beats you and starves you and they treat you horrible, and it is not logical to stay in that relationship and wait in that relationship, until you find a new one. Attorney General Eric Holder says, ""in things racial, we have always been and we continue to be in a nation of cowards. It is an issue we’ve never been at ease with and given our nation ‘s history, it is somewhat understandable. Yet, if we are to make progress in this area, we must feel comfortable enough with one another, and tolerant enough.."" you know the quote, obviously, ""to have frank conversations."" Is he right? The problem in America is we’ve had this conversation since Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King had plenty of conversations, Rosa Parks had plenty of conversations... So what, conversations aren’t going to do it? It is time for action. Eric Holder, if you really mean that, show us something that represents that. In America, a black person is murdered by the police every 28 hours, I sure you’ve heard the statistic. I say to the country, if it is illegal, actually concretely illegal for police officers to murder unarmed black people, if this is a fact, show statistics that support that. Statistics do not support it. That is a symbolic quote. Symbolism does not bring people back from the dead. You can have all of the symbolism in the world if you want, the fact The weekend is nearly upon us and it is looking decidedly chilly but Saturday is looking like the best day of the week in regards to the amount of sunshine. There will be wintry showers in the forecast with long spells of sunshine in southern and eastern areas and on Sunday it will be a cold and frosty start coming with and windy through the course of the day with snow falling over high ground in the north. For tonight it looks like it will stay pretty cool. A northwest wind feeding showers into those areas, mainly rain in the Southeast and a risk of ice. Temperatures will be colder in rural areas. Saturday will be chilly but there will be brightness and sunshine around. Showers getting into southern and eastern areas. Sunny spells but feeling chillilash temperatures 4-7 celsius. A cold night and on Saturday morning, most of us waking up to a frost. But it will be bring in southern and eastern parts of the UK. Skies turn cloudier across the west, as this weather system moves in, outbreaks of rain and winds as well. Significant snow falling over the higher ground as that rain bumps into the cold air. Accumulations of snow likely across the high ground of Scotland, particularly across the Highlands and towards the southern uplands and snow down to lower levels for a time in the heaviest of the rain. Snowfalls over the higher ground of northern England and maybe Wales as well. Winds moving strong across Irish Sea coastal areas and heavy rain pushing in there. But the Midlands eastwards having a fine morning with plenty of sunshine after that cold start. It looks like we’ll hold on to the brightness across the extreme south-east of England until later on in the afternoon, when the skies turn cloudy, and that rain arrives as well. But out west it will be blustery, heavy rain continuing, and those winds quite a feature, particularly in Northern Ireland in towards western Scotland and Wales. And feeling quite cold and raw. As we head on in towards Monday, you can see tightly packed isobars pushing in off the Atlantic and the blue colours indicating we will stay on the chilly side and all the weather fronts denoting showers. So it will stay unsettled into the start of next week, but general some showers and also sunshine on the cards, too. ~ Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Laura Westbrook. Our top stories. A fire has ripped through one of the tallest residential buildings in Dubai, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people. Debris was seen falling to the ground but emergency services say they have now brought the fire under control and that there are no reports of casualties. It was about 2:30am and the alarm went off and the amount of times we have had it go off and it was a false Despite the ceasefire, sporadic fighting has continued on eastern Ukraine’s frontline around the embattled town of Debaltseve. As Hollywood gears up for its annual awards bash, we look at the lobbying behind the scenes at the Oscars. Hello. We start with breaking news from Dubai. A fire has ripped through the Marina Torch skyscraper but has now been brought under control. Strong winds helped the blaze to spread across the 336 metre tall building in the marina district. There are no reports of any casualties. Witnesses said thousands of people have been evacuated. The fire appeared to start at around the 50th floor of the 79-storey building. A little while ago I spoke to Kathryn Dickie, who lives in the Marina Torch Tower and told me what happened. At about 2:00am this morning, the fire alarm started to go off and within about three or four minutes security guards were banging on our doors and ringing the doorbell and told us there was a fire and we need you to get out quickly. -- needed. Everyone went to the fire escapes and started going down. Someone was in a towel. They hadn’t even taken the time to put on clothes and everyone was getting out as quickly as they could. How long did it take for emergency services to get there? By the time I got downstairs, I was on the 13th floor so it didn’t take too long, roughly four up the floors were completely covered on one side and I saw a fire truck and police cars were starting to arrive. But at that moment, it was just our to arrive. But at that moment, it wasjust our building was just our building security dealing with the evacuation. We have been hearing that strong winds helped to spread the blaze and we are looking at amateur footage now. I don’t know if you can hear the whistling behind me because I am in another building but the wind was so strong today. There were pieces of the building, it is covered in panels that are roughly one metres tall each and they were catching on fire and coming off the building and being picked up by the wind and I was watching them go down the street still on fire, they were not going out but going into buildings across the road which was actually really scary and we all went further and further down the street because the debris was falling everywhere. That must have been terrible. I have been to Dubai and there are lots of fire drills in buildings like this because of the need to get out quickly. I have been in Marina Torch for a year and quickly. I have been in Marina Torch fora yearand a for a year and a half and I must admit we have never had a fire drill. Not that I know of. Certainly in the commercial buildings you do regularfire drills but in the commercial buildings you do regular fire drills but I have in the commercial buildings you do regularfire drills but I have never done it in a big tower. And you are on the 13th floor and the fire started around the 50th. Do you have any idea when you’ll be able to go back home? Absolutely no idea. The time the fire was put out... It had reached almost the very top floor of the building on one side and I also heard that debris had fallen onto the 20th floor and I could see that was on fire in videos I saw on social media. I really don’t know what sort of damage is being done but the building is big and if the lift system is damaged by fire or taken out, you cannot get access, evenif taken out, you cannot get access, even if the apartments for sound to go back into. My colleague Peter Dobbie spoke to Cyrille Sekretev who lives in the building opposite the Marina Torch and saw the fire. From my 50th floor, I saw fire falling from the tower and within a couple of minutes, less than ten or 20 minutes, it had gotten even higher. We had been asking if we should evacuate and we all evacuated by the stairs. We were outside waiting to come back inside. So the fire appears to have spread quite quickly? Yes. There was a sandstorm today and it was very windy so the wind did not help the situation. How long did it take emergency services to get there? I am not sure but you could see the difference when they did. It was very good and everything was very well-organized. We are looking at amateur video footage. Are the flames now out? Yes they are out of one tower but not the other. Can you give us a sense of what the building is like? Dubai Marina is predominantly residential. This building is 60 or 70 floors and my apartment is one of those. If you live in a tower block, you must be constantly aware that if a fire takes hold, you have to get out quickly. I am very high in the tower had four or five fire exercises. How did you know to evacuate? Did the emergency services contact you? There was an alarm and a voice telling me to evacuate. Do you know anyone who lives in that building? No. What is the atmosphere and the feeling amongst people like yourself who live not just in high-rise buildings but those surrounding this particular tower? We were very scared because there was a lot of wind so you could see a lot of debris and fire flying everywhere. We had the impression that the fire was more or less controlled and then it started again at the bottom of the building because of the debris. After intensive talks in Brussels, a deal has been reached to extend Greece’s bailout. It’s subject to Athens producing a list of economic reforms, by Monday, which will have to be approved by its creditors. The breakthrough came after a standoff between Greece and Germany about which austerity measures should remain in place as a condition of any further funding. Here’s our Europe Editor, Gavin Hewitt. This was the third time that the eurozone finance ministers had sat around the table. The tensions and strains were growing. The Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said they had gone the extra ten miles to satisfy their creditors but the German Finance Minister had rejected the Greek plan to extend the bailout. But enormous pressures were building to strike a deal, even if many of the details will be worked out in the weeks and months ahead. Tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding trust. As you know, trust leaves quicker then it comes. The Greeks had to make concessions, no rolling back of reforms or unilateral action to impact the budget and all debts to be honoured. The Greek government said they had turned a page. We stood upright from the beginning of negotiations to the very end especially when faced with immense pressure. And we showed that we were committed to skillful negotiations for the purpose of achieving a mutually beneficial agreement between us and our European partners. To seal this new agreement, Greece will have to draw up a list of reforms by Monday and they will have to be based upon the existing bailout agreement. Only then will the deal be finalized by eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday. It is clear that both Europe and Greece are moving ahead very cautiously. The new radical left Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras has won a financial lifeline and Greece stays in the eurozone but he will struggle to deliver on many campaign promises. There will be no new austerity measures but existing measures remain in place and the new government’s hands are tied over how much they can spend on social programmes.

Let’s round-up some of the other main stories: More than 150 women and children abducted by the Nigerianjihadist group Boko Haram have been reunited with their families. They were kidnapped in Yobe State in north-eastern Nigeria in December. One report says the militants abandoned the hostages in a village after they were attacked by security forces. The President of Liberia says the country’s borders will reopen on Sunday, after being closed last year due to the Ebola outbreak. In a statement published on her official website, Ellen johnson Sirleaf says nationwide curfews will also be lifted. The Somali jihadist group, Al Shabaab, has carried out a double suicide attack on a hotel in the capital Mogadishu. The authorities say at least ten people have been killed, including two MPs and the city’s deputy mayor. The deputy Prime Minister and two other ministers were wounded in the attack, which came during Friday prayers. A series of bomb blasts in Libya has killed at least 40 people and left dozens more injured. A group affiliated to Islamic State has claimed responsibility. The blasts took place in the eastern city of Kabaw. Seven days of official mourning have been declared as Ben Bland reports. bombing in the town of Kabaw in eastern Libya. People trying to put out the fire. This attack by a group linked to the so-called Islamic State killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens more. In all three bombs were set off targeting a petrol station, a police station and the home of the parliamentary speaker. They claimed they had done it in retaliation for the airstrikes project. Those were carried out after 21 Christians were murdered by the militants in Libya. Islamic State, seen here parading through the streets, has exploited the instability in Libya emerged and the internationally recognised one up their authorisation of the Security Council to equip our army with the adequate weapons and military equipment that would be necessary to fight terrorism. There have been other recent deadly attacks in Libya. just last month attacks in Libya. just last militants stormed a hotel in Tripoli killing many people including four in nationals. -- for in.

First let’s round up the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The Financial Times reports on what they call the ""eleventh-hour deal"" between Greece and the Eurozone to extend the country’s 172 billion euro rescue programme for four months. In France, Le Figaro reports a state of emergency in France after two million people contract a particularly virulent seasonal flu this year. The Irish Times has a story on Dublin’s property bubble, saying the recent crash isjust one of many booms and busts in the last 300 years and not even close to being the worst. The Straits Times reports on plans of a new offensive to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State militants. And the International New York Times says the country’s huge economic growth which has created opportunities for women have fostered a return to traditional values. This is BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. The latest headlines: A fire has ripped through the 79-floor Marina Torch Tower in Dubai. Authorities say there are no reports of casualties - hundreds have been evacuated. Eurozone finance ministers have reached an agreement with Greece to extend the country’s bailout deal for four months, to allow time for a review of its austerity measures. The Ukrainian capital, Kiev, has been marking the first anniversary of the clashes between protesters and police which toppled ex-President Viktor Yanukovych. One of the towns engulfed by the ensuing violence is Debaltseve. It’s been two days since Russian-backed rebels recaptured the strategically important town, forcing government troops to retreat. Our correspondent, Paul Adams, has been to Debaltseve and found civilians emerging after weeks of fighting After nine months of this war, the landscape is littered with its twisted remains. Here on the road to Debaltseve, the Ukraine army fought off the rebel advance for weeks. Three weeks ago the checkpoint fell and the town soon followed. This was a ferocious assault. The Ukrainian soldiers here were overwhelmed. The victors scavenged through the wreckage. Most were from eastern Ukraine but there was one Russian here. The bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lie in the cold, uncollected and ignored three days after they died here. There is exploded ammunition everywhere and mine -- There is unexploded ammunition everywhere and mines that need to Be moved. We move into Debaltseve and the shelling has taken its toll. The town is very quiet. This is the central street in Debaltseve and as you can see it is practically deserted apart from some civilians and some soldiers. This town has not had gas, water or electricity since the New Year. Many people are still living underground and are afraid to come out. We can still hear the sound of occasional fire. This part of Debaltseve is a bit of a ghost town. TRANSLATION: I think you can see it on my face. We were notjust scared we were in complete shock. Imagine my child, she is scared of everything now. She couldn’t She could n’t speak After weeks of living underground, this man has comeback to check on his modest house. A shell exploded outside. His neighbour said they are tired of replacing broken windows. TRANSLATION: Everything is ruined. The Ukrainian National Guard hit us with shells. Who do you blame for all this destruction? He is clear that it is all the fault of the President of Ukraine. On the road out of Debaltseve, some of the men are leaving with theirjob done. They are confident, but having won will the leaders now agree to stop shooting or have they already decided on the next target? Police have issued an urgent appeal for help in finding three schoolgirls from east London who are believed to be trying to joinjihadists fighting in Syria. The three teenagers flew to Turkey on Tuesday without telling their families. Scotland Yard detectives say they consider the girls to be Filmed by CCTV cameras at Gatwick Airport as they left Britain and all in the same year at school. Shamima Begum isjust 15, but could be on her way tojoin the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. With her, her 16-year-old friend called Kadiza Sultana. Both are British Bangladeshis and both are successful at school, as was the third friend, who is also 15 - but whose family don’t want to be identified. This afternoon, the head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command Ya rd’s cou nter-terrorism command appealed Yard’s counter-terrorism command appealed for them to come home or for nins who sees them to contact the police in Turkey. We are concerned they will go into Syria where, of course, they could be connected with Islamic State, and we are all aware of the treatment of girls and women in that part of Syria. The friends all went to this school - the Bethnal Green Academy - in London, rated outstanding by Ofsted. This week it’s half term. The girls left their homes early on Tuesday morning, lying to their parents about their plans. At Gatwick, they boarded a Turkish Airlines plane for Istanbul - the same route to Syria taken by a fourth friend in December. Though tonight, one of the school’s governors found it hard to believe the girls were really trying to get to Syria. I thought that, first of all, it was a joke, saying that they are off to Syria. But I still don’t believe that they’re going anywhere other than a holiday, because this is how they were dressed and this is how they looked and this is how they packed. Luckily for British police, Turkey is being plagued by savage winter weather and travel chaos, so detectives are hoping the three schoolgirls haven’t yet made it to the Syrian border. This is the first time that Scotland Yard has gone public with the names of teenage girls who have travelled to Syria. It is a sign of how concerned they are about the girls’ safety and how worried they are about the growing phenomenon ofjihadi brides. It’s thought that more than 50 British women and hundreds from other Western European countries have already travelled to join Islamic State. Many of them are still of school age. Some are encouraged to go there by other women, who have already made the journey. There’s women who are at the forefront of trying to recruit young girls, but there’s also men, older jihadi men, who are befriending these girls on certain sites like jihad Matchmaker and other websites and social media sites and encouraging young girls, befriending them, and doing similar behaving in a similar way to the way child sexual exploiter groomers behave, actually. Tonight, the families of the three girls are said to be desperate - still hoping somebody will stop their daughters crossing the border into Syria, and into the dangerous world of the Islamic State. After a group of Chelsea fans prevented a black Parisian from boarding a train while singing racist chants, the club’s management has apologised. They said they will invite the man, known only as Souleymane S, to their home ground in London - Stamford Bridge - to see a match as their guest. Chelsea managerjose Mourinho said that he and the team were disappointed in the fans. ~ I felt ashamed when I knew what happened. But, I repeat, I’m a proud Chelsea Football Club manager, because I know what the club is - and these people don’t represent the club. It’s a night of films, frocks and gushing speeches - and this year’s Oscars on Sunday are sure to live up to expectations. But how much of the awards are based on actual performance? Our Arts Editor, Will Gompertz, has been looking at the lobbying behind the scenes. The glitz and glamour of the film awards season is about to reach its climax. This is the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood where on Sunday night, film stars and movie moguls will arrive via this soon to be revealed red carpet to find out to whom the 6,000 plus Academy members have decided to award an Oscar. It will bring to an end months of campaigning by producers to make sure their film has had the best possible chance of winning. Obviously they are not allowed to bribe Academy members but some behind-the-scenes lobbying can sail quite close to the wind. There are screenings and dinners and informal ""get your friends together"". But the Academy tries to control that as much as possible in this phase of the voting. OK, it tries but it doesn’t always succeed, as this veteran Hollywood producer admits. There is some wining and dining but they have actually stopped that, I wouldn’t say completely, but there is less of it and it is people who will basically screen a movie at their house. I saw one of the movies that way. If you reverse time, then the universe is getting smaller. So the tactics have become more subtle. Competing film should be viewed in impartial surroundings which you could argue is difficult to achieve if one of the stars is hanging about before the screening. That is exactly what happened and I happened to like the movie and Eddie Redmayne wasn’t in the room when I saw it. The fact is, I don’t know that I would have said anything different than what I said or felt. I have been called all sorts of things over the years - The truth is, the Oscars are all more than matched by international brands pushing theirs. I think the misperception about celebrities is that they are too rich and famous to care about getting gifts and the reality is that you are never too rich or famous to enjoy a gift - receiving or giving. And this is the way many celebrities shop. These are the unofficial £125,000 consolation goody bags that will be given to the stars who go home without a golden statue. Everyone is a winner at the Oscars - proving there really is no business like showbusiness. Before we go, a reminder of our top story: A fire at a high-rise building in Dubai is now under control. Medics say there are no reports of casualties. Do stay with us here on BBC News, thanks for your company. Hello there. The weekend is virtually upon us and I think for most of us, Saturday is shaping up to be the best day of the weekend with regards to dryer, brighter weather. There will be some wiptry showers around, particularly wintry across the north and west of the UK. Into Sunday, it starts off very cold, bright with some sunshine but turns wet and windy as the day progresses with some snow in the north. Through the course of tonight it will remain quite cold across many areas and showers across northern and western areas, there is a significant risk of eyes by the late in the night. This is towns and city temperatures. So Saturday, this is the big picture. You can see north-westwesterly winds bringing in a feed of showers at times. Weather front may enhance showers across Scotland by Saturday. But there will be a good deal of dry and bright weather as well. Variable amounts of showers, a few cloud and sunny spells. Through the day we will continue to see a few showers across northern and western areas, wintry over the higher ground and showers getting into southern and eastern areas as well, some of them may contain a mixture of hail as well. Sunny spells but feeling chilly - temperatures 4-7 celsius. A cold night and on Saturday morning, most of us waking up to a frost. But it will be bright in southern and eastern parts of the UK. Skies turn cloudier across the west, as this weather system moves in, outbreaks of rain and winds as well. Significant snow falling over the higher ground as that rain bumps into the cold air. Accumulations of snow likely across the high ground of Scotland, particularly across the Highlands and towards the southern uplands and snow down to lower levels for a time in the heaviest of the rain. Snowfalls over the higher ground of northern England and maybe Wales as well. Winds will be quite strong across Irish Sea coastal areas and heavy rain pushing in there. But the Midlands eastwards having a fine morning with plenty of sunshine after that cold start. It looks like we’ll hold on to the brightness across the extreme south-east of England until later on in the afternoon, when the skies turn cloudy, and that rain arrives as well. But out west it will be blustery, heavy rain continuing, and those winds quite a feature, particularly in Northern Ireland in towards western Scotland and Wales. And feeling quite cold and raw. As we head on in towards Monday, you can see tightly packed isobars pushing in off the Atlantic and the blue colours indicating we will stay on the chilly side and all the weather fronts denoting showers. So it will stay unsettled into the start of next week, generally some showers and also sunshine on the cards, too. A fire has broken out in a high-rise tower in Dubai. The blaze was on the upper floors of a 79-storey residential building called The Torch, one of the tallest in the world. It’s now under control. The building is more than 300 metres tall. There are no reports of any casualties. Eurozone finance ministers have granted Greece a four-month extension of its international bailout. The deal means Greece will stay in the eurozone for now, and will not run out of money next week. The Greek finance minister called it a ""mutually beneficial agreement"". The leaders of France and Germany have renewed calls for a full implementation of the ceasefire deal they helped negotiate for eastern Ukraine. The plea comes amid continuing breaches of the truce in several cities and towns, including the embattled town of Debaltseve. Let’s take a quick look now at the front pages of some of the first editions of this morning’s papers. The Guardian leads with the race to find three schoolgirls, but the eye-catching title immediately below is about finances. The paper says that Labour are planning a tax raid on pensions to fund lower tuition fees. The Independent says that thousands are being unfairly hounded over tax credits by an American services company working for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. Staying with finances, but of the personal kind, the Telegraph writes that savers in their 40s and 50s may have been misled over the size of their final salary pensions. The FT examines in detail how Greece and eurozone finance ministers reached an 11th-hour bail out deal. And Daily Express leads with a health story. It reports on a major study which has found that a Mediterranean-style diet may help fight dementia. Now on BBC News, it’s time for Click. OK, guys, insert piece number 45 into hole 82. Welcome to Click and welcome to the Distributive Robotics Lab at MIT, where these guys are doing something that all humans hope we won’t have to do in the future. They’re building furniture... ..really slowly, but it is doing it. It’s got the screw in and that’s better than me, for a start. The grip here isjust four rubberbands but, as it twists, it manages to grip the table leg properly. Each piece of the furniture has a unique pattern of reflective balls on the robots and there’s a whole array of infrared sensors around the room, so the computer system running this knows where everything is. The point of this is to work towards robots that can work together collaboratively to build complex structures. It’s only a table today but you could imagine one day it could be a whole space nation and this is the beginning of the research into that area. -- space station. This isjust one of countless projects here at MIT, one of the most famous universities in the world. It spans over a mile of the bank of the Charles River in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just across from Boston. Wow! MIT was founded with the motto ‘Mens et Manus’, mind and hand, and it’s this commitment to the academic pursuits alongside manual labour, alongside the mechanical arts and industry and commerce. MIT has been responsible for many of the things that we take for granted. The Gillette razor, transistor radio, electronic ink, the spreadsheet and, ost importantly of all, condensed soup. -- most. With 81 Nobel laureates to its name, MIT has squarely set its sights on solving some of the world’s biggest and most challenging problems. The issues of the planet are profound and MIT has to make a contribution in that space. We have the skills and we have the people who can make a real difference and I think what you see here is a commitment to making that happen. The Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory is the largest research lab here and it’s also the weirdest looking. Looks like Gaudi’s had a go at that one. Anyway, it’s here that we enrol on ourjourney. So, the Distributive Robotics Lab looks like this. I have no idea what that is. This is Baxter, the very famous robot. This is also a robotic project. More on that in a second. The occasional oscilloscope just hanging round. And here, a man sat undera sun umbrella that’s covered in lights. Here’s a robotic garden, full of programmable, moving LED flowers and designed to illustrate some, shall we say, less visually interesting but nevertheless essential computer science techniques. It’s difficult to get some young students, in particular girls, interested in computer science and this is a really colourful and visually pleasing way to kind of demonstrate some basic computer SCiâIâ1Câ COI’1CâptS. Like fundamental algorithms that every computer scientist needs to know, such as how to find the shortest path from A to B. Computers do it by exploring all the different routes until they’ve found the shortest route. This garden makes that look sexy. Demonstrated here by the flowers changing colour as the software tries different routes. The shortest path eventually turns green. This sheep is having a real go at this rose. One of the main missions of this lab in particular is to develop robots that can think for themselves and work together to solve increasingly complex problems, by assembling themselves into complex shapes, and even pushing the limits of what we think of as robots. We are interested in making soft body robots, where the body of the robot looks more like muscles and for that reason it’s much safer to interact with and to be around. They also have a different range of capabilities. It’s also very important to rethink how we make robots. a robot that will pick up all And this is how far that particular project has gone so far. Software that will design electronics and exoskeleton schematics and then print out a cardboard robot body to solve a specific problem. Right now we have a system where you describe the solution to the problem. You can say, in order to accomplish this goal I need to be able to drive forward, talk and listen. From that description it’ll go ahead and give you a first pass layout of a robot and tell you which electronics you need and how to connect them together. It’ll give you the software you can run on the robot itself and give you a smartphone interface, so you can control it with whatever phone you have. It sounds pretty complete but you haven’t got it to actually ask the questions and work it out. It’s still user-assisted. The higher-level task that still needs to be addressed is how do you go from the task description to the solution. Early days, but these might one day be machines that design themselves. Of course there are other important bits of research going on at MIT, aside from robotics. On a medical tip, the institute is looking at how smart we can get with our own health. And we’ve been to the lab that could replace a visit to the doctors. Anita has won a foundation challenge worth $500,000 by creating a box that will tell you if you’ve got AIDS, Ebola orjust common garden flu. Tests that in the past could take months can be done by this machine in under an hour and with just a drop of blood. This is the first time they’ve allowed cameras in to film the real thing in action. Diagnosing the disease is the first step to managing the disease, with a correct diagnosis. What we are providing is a tool and a system to democratise access to that healthcare information, empowering people take ownership of their own health. Its inventor has studied the nature of DNA for most of her working life. The Gene Radar doesn’tjust save time but could cut costs by more than 99%. Its size means it can be deployed quickly and in remote areas, helping stop epidemics and offer certainty to someone’s condition, even if they do not show the symptoms. So, what is Doctor Gul waiting for? This is a case where the technology is ready but we need a global ecosystem of adopters and partners to help change the model, to a more decentralised, democratised, personalised model. Given enough time, these randomly swirling shapes will do something very clever. They will stick together, assembling themselves into the same lattice structure every time. It is their shape and the position of the magnets on their sides that guarantees that same pattern. Welcome to the world of self assembling materials. If we look at the processes of assembly outside of the human scale, how planets form, and look at very small scales, chemistry, physics, biology, it is different to how we build human scales. So we’re interested in an alternate process, maybe something that opens up construction possibilities where it is dangerous, or where it’s difficult today. It’s a very hot topic, indeed the subject of the new Disney movie Big Hero 6. Microbots? Here at MIT, I have come to see the start of making that science fiction into fact. Skylar Tibbets has been working on all kinds of materials that can go from a random clump to a predetermined shape. All that you need is to apply a little energy. Maybe it can be powered through changing temperatures? Or sunlight or moisture. Or, the turbulence of water which can, over several hours, bump and tumble this clump of parts into a chair. The secret again is that particular combination of magnets, and the unique locking pattern on each end of each piece. They only fit together one way. We are proposing that we can do this at larger scales. Products, electronic components that assemble themselves, or even large structures like infrastructures, buildings and space stations. The other category is our programmable materials, we look at new forms of products, where materials are more adaptive and transform on-the-fly to adapt to the environment, and user scenarios. Printing a layer of special material to carbon fibre will make it curl in a particular direction when exposed to heat, allowing, for example, aircraft parts to change shape at different speeds and altitudes. This is not a world of intelligent materials, not yet. But it is certainly a step towards a future where design is not left completely to the human design. -- designers.

With so many colleges in such a small area, there are lots of start-ups around and we will check out some of them next week. Thanks for watching and see you next time. Hello and welcome to Newswatch. Later on the programme: The BBC’s regional news has got shorter at lunch time and longer late at night. We try to find out what is going on. First though, your reaction to how BBC News has treated some of the news stories of the past week, and not many subjects have received as much air time as the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Here is Ian Pannell reporting from Donetsk at some personal risk. This supposed to be day two of the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, as we have been hearing... The peace has not settled in. We have been hearing the sound of artillery shots being fired. There is another one. Most of it appears to be outgoing. What the people of the Donetsk People’s Republic are saying is they are suppressing fire... Stay together. Run. A retired BBC News cameraman, Pete Henderson, wanted to send this message to Ian. No point having your helmet under your arm while bombs explode round your head during your piece to camera. You BFE VâI’y iJI’3Vâ. Be sensible and stay safe. Put your helmet on for goodness sake. Mrs Bobby Thompson said the following. Last Friday was the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Dresden during World War II and it was marked across BBC News with live coverage of commemorations and reports such as this, from Germany correspondent jenny Hill. 70 years ago Allied Bombers took off. Their target, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Beneath them, people burned and suffocated to death - as a firestorm with hurricane force winds raged through Dresden. For scores of viewers, the BBC focussed too much on criticisms of the bombing raids for being disproportionate. Now, were you excited to discover on Thursday night who killed Lucy Beale? Or did you find the whole thing distasteful? If you don’t know what I am talking about, you are clearly not a devotee of Eastenders, which marked an anniversary this week, its 30th, with a special live edition. The celebrations were not confined to the soap opera itself, but featured prominently on BBC News, everyone including analysis by a crime correspondent, much to regret of David Wall. Now, what is the most watched television news output in the country? Well done to those of you who said it’s the half hour BBC regional news programmes as 6.30pm. news programmes at 6.30pm. There is clearly an appetite then for what the BBC calls the News Where You Are. But recent changes in the time the corporation allocates to regional news have produced a mixed response. Now on BBC One it is time for the News Where You Are. Goodnight. Tonight on BBC London News... If you care about local news you will have noticed that for the past four weeks, the regional news bulletin following the News at Ten has been almost doubled in length to 15 minutes from Monday to Thursday. A change which will last to the start ofjune, and has been prompted by the general election in May. For one viewer, that isjust too much. That is all from me. Fans of regional news across England will be happy though, unless that is, they watch Where You Are, first let’s catch up with all the latest sports news. It has been shortened to a slot of five-and-a-half minutes and a sports news section has been added. Two viewers who prefer to watch their news in the middle of the day gave us their responses. There is little enough regional news on TV anyway, to reduce it further seems unsatisfactory. I recognise this is balanced by the late evening extension, you have reduced choice. Many, like the elderly, will find the lunch time more convenient to watch than the late one. We think the change is made less satisfactory because what has replaced the regional news, the lost regional news, is sports news. Sports news can be found everywhere. The local news item has been basically replaced by a regular sports item. The fact is, that there isn’t really sports news every day. So they fill it with guff and gossip. Thing things like another football manager is being under threat of losing hisjob, another rugby player might be injured, another English cricket captain gives his lame excuses for another poor performance, things that are gossip. That is not news, what we are losing out on is a decent lunch time local news review and report, which are a good and interesting and relevant part of the daily news content. So what is the thinking behind the changes? David Holdsworth is the controller of the BBC’s English regions, and he joins me now from Bristol. You have almost doubled the regional news content after the News at Ten but halved it at lunch time. Why? Well, basically, the audience late at night is bigger than the one at lunch time. There is a huge appetite for greater analysis, context and depth from the audience that watch the News at Ten, we wanted to have a look at that idea, of providing that extra depth at that time, particularly in the run up to the general election, when we know there is a lot of political activity in the evening, a lot of updating of stories to report on. But I hate to disappoint any regional news viewers. I know the fact you have had the comments tells me how much people love their regional news programmes, but it is a matter of budgets, to increase the durations of one set of bulletins, we have, as a pilot I stress, reduced the ones at lunch time. How would you answer people like that gentleman we heard from, who feels there is almost no real regional news coverage through the whole day? Well, I say to him there is still time for us to update viewers on the key stories of the day, at lunch time. In the new duration, there is still room for a full and comprehensive weather forecast, and it is a fact that the news cycle develops over the day. There is less news to report on at lunch time, than there would be later in the day. I would repeat the point this is a pilot. It will run until earlyjune, after the election, we will analyse all the feedback we get, including the feedback you have given me today, and make a decision about what we want to do permanently in due course, later in the year. You cited the forthcoming general election as the reason for this, but it is a long way away. You are not filling it all with political content. We are featuring a lot of issues that are hot in the general election campaign. So National Health Service developments in different areas would be a good example of that. We are using the extra time for more live outside broadcasts, for more reports about arts and culture. We know there is a demand for knowing more about what is going on in the arts world in different parts of the region. For more analysis and more context of the stories of the day. The other big complaint is how much extra sport there is, replacing some of the regional coverage at lunch time. What do you say to viewers who feel there is too much content which isn’t news, it is hirings and firings and replacing real regional news content? I am not responsible for the direct decision about what the news includes at 1pm. What I would say in my experience, sport is always a divisive issue, there are people who are passionate about sport, and I think you could argue that away from the News Channel there is not much sport covered, so this is an important new service and there are a lot of sports stories that develop round the world, during the night and the morning which can be reflected at this time. Viewers can often feel, they do tell Newswatch, they watch the regional news and it a story they heard earlier in the national news bulletin. They are not getting anything new. That comes up when you have a system in which the regional news follows the national news, what I would say is at the moment the agenda is very international, and very Westminster, for obvious reason, to do with the general election, and developments in London, and a number of big international stories that are playing out. I would say there is less repetition than usual at the moment, we do try where possible not to repeat stories, but you do get some stories that are so important in a region, even though they have a brief mention in the national news, our audience want us to analyse them in greater depth and provide the context and other angles. Thank you. Finally a brief look at how the BBC uses captions, the labels on screen to provide extra information on interviewees, a job title or the fact they are an eyewitness, sometimes a careless caption can offend, and just using the name of the person might be better. Our attention has been drawn to a report on the news website about a same sex couple thrown out of a cafe in Austria for kissing. Watch how the speaker is captioned.

The weekend is virtually upon us and I think, for most of us, Saturday is shaping up to be the best day of the weekend with regards to dryer, brighter weather. There will be some wintry showers around - particularly wintry across the north and west of the UK. Into Sunday, it starts off very cold - bright with some sunshine, but turning wet and windy as the day progresses, with some snow in the north. Through the course of tonight it will remain quite cold across many areas and where we have showers across northern and western areas, there is a significant risk of ice towards the end of the night. These are towns and city temperatures, which are lower than this - particularly in the north. This is the big picture. North-easterly winds bringing in a feed of showers. This weather front may enhance showers across Scotland through the course of Saturday, but there will be a good deal of dry and bright weather as well. So a cold start for most places. Variable amounts of showers, a few cloudy and sunny spells. Through the day we will continue to see a few showers across northern and western areas, wintry over the higher ground and showers getting into southern and eastern areas as well. Some of them may contain a mixture of hail as well. Sunny spells in between, but feeling chilly - temperatures 4-7 celsius. A cold night and on Saturday morning most of us waking up to a frost. But it will be bright in southern and eastern parts of the UK. Skies turn cloudier across the west as this weather system moves in. Outbreaks of rain and winds as well. Significant snow falling over the higher ground as that rain bumps into the cold air. Accumulations of snow likely across the higher ground of Scotland, particularly across the Highlands and towards the Southern Uplands and snow down to lower levels for a time in the heaviest of the rain. Snowfalls over the higher ground of northern England and maybe for Wales as well. Winds will be quite strong across the Irish Sea coastal areas and heavy rain pushing in there. But the Midlands eastwards having a fine morning with plenty of sunshine after that cold start. It looks like we’ll hold on to the brightness across the extreme south-east of England until later on in the afternoon, when the skies turn cloudy and that rain arrives as well. But out west it will be blustery, heavy rain continuing, and those winds quite a feature, particularly in Northern Ireland in towards western Scotland and Wales. And feeling quite cold and raw. As we head on in towards Monday, you can see tightly packed isobars pushing in off the Atlantic and the blue colours indicating we will stay on the chilly side and all the weather fronts denoting showers. So it will stay quite unsettled into the early part of next week - generally quite cold and windy with some showers, but also some sunshine on the cards, too. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. I’m Laura Westbrook. Our top stories: A fire has ripped through one of the tallest residential buildings in Dubai, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people. Debris was seen falling from the Torch Marina tower, but the fire is now under control and there are no reports of casualties. After a day of crisis talks, Greece gets a bailout extension, Militants with ties to Islamic State say they are responsible. we look at the lobbying behind the scenes at the Oscars. Hello. We begin in Dubai, where a fire that ripped through the Marina Torch building has been brought under control. Strong winds helped the blaze to spread across the 336 metre tall residential building. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the tower, but there are no reports of any casualties. The fire appeared to start at around the 50th floor of the 79-storey building. A little while ago I spoke to Kathryn Dickie, who lives in the Marina Torch tower. She described what happened. At about 2:00am this morning, the fire alarm started to go off and within about three or four minutes security guards were banging on our doors and ringing the doorbell and told us there was a fire and we needed to get out quickly. So everyone went to the fire escapes and started going down. There was someone in a towel. They hadn’t even taken the time to put on clothes and everyone was getting out as quickly as they could. And how long did it take for emergency services to get there? By the time I got downstairs, I was on the 13th floor so it didn’t take too long, about four storeys were completely ablaze on one side and I saw a fire truck and police cars were starting to arrive. But at that moment, it was just our building security dealing with the evacuation. We have been hearing that strong winds helped to spread the blaze and we are looking at amateur footage now. I don’t know if you can hear the whistling behind me because I’m in another building but the wind is so strong today. There were pieces of the building, it’s covered in panels that are roughly one metre tall each, and they were catching on fire and coming off the building and being picked up by the wind and I was watching them go down the street still on fire, they were not going out but going into buildings across the road which was actually really scary and we all went further and further down the street because the debris was falling everywhere. And you are on the 13th floor and the fire started around the 50th. Do you have any idea when you’ll be able to go back home? Absolutely no idea. By the time the fire was put out, it had reached almost the very top floor of the building on one side and I also heard that debris had fallen onto the 20th floor and I could see that was on fire in videos I saw on social media. So I really don’t know what sort of damage is being done but the building is big and if the lift system is damaged by fire or taken out, you really can’t get access, even if the apartments were sound to go back into. Marcus George is a journalist. He joins us live from Dubai. We just heard there were some quite disturbing scenes but it appears the management acted very quickly, knocking on doors and getting people out? It certainly has been very dramatic throughout the night in the area. One very newly built area of Dubai, where there are very tall buildings in very close proximity to one another. It’s very interesting just how quickly the fire spread across about 20-25 floors or indeed more. And just how quickly the authorities reacted. Firefighters were authorities reacted. Firefighters were at the scene, building security apparatus and it kicked in very quickly. Otherwise this could have been a very fatal incident. There are of course a lot of apartments, a lot of people living in that building. Some of my friends live in it. I spoke to them this morning and certainly a serious tragedy, -- tragedy has been averted. That footage shows a massive blaze and a fire has been put out now. Do we have any idea of what caused it? No indication at this time about what caused it. I’m sure investigators will be looking very closely. Given there are so many high-rise residential buildings like that, with people in them, leaving all year round, they will want to know very quickly and want to put in any additional safety measures that they can, because it’s a serious risk. It has happened before, there was a blaze about two years ago in another area. They will be on the chase to see what happened and is no doubt they will come up with some answers. just tell us what the area is like. As I say, it’s very high intensity, in terms of people living there. There are huge towers and it’s and area of development. Shopping walls, a lot of buildings going up, a lot of hotels. -- shopping malls. Very dense and that’s why it is critical to get his speedy rescue services out there, if these kinds of things happen. I think it’s certainly a huge relief that things were enacted quickly and certainly today there will be a lot of going over of events for people involved, but also the security services to find out exactly what happened. Indeed of relief for many of the people there. Thank and Germany about which austerity measures should remain in place as a condition of any further funding. Here’s our Europe Editor, Gavin Hewitt. This was the third time that the eurozone finance ministers had sat around the table. The tensions and strains were growing. The Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said they had gone the extra ten miles to satisfy their creditors but the German Finance Minister had rejected the Greek plan to extend the bailout. But enormous pressures were building to strike a deal, even if many of the details will be worked out in the weeks and months ahead. Tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding trust. As you know, trust leaves quicker then it comes. The Greeks had to make concessions, no rolling back of reforms or unilateral action to impact the budget and all debts to be honoured. The Greek government said they had turned a page. We stood upright from the beginning of negotiations to the very end especially when faced with immense pressure. And we showed that we were committed to skillful negotiations for the purpose of achieving a mutually beneficial agreement between us and our European partners. To seal this new agreement, Greece will have to draw up a list of reforms by Monday and they will have to be based upon the existing bailout agreement. Only then will the deal be finalised by eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday. It is clear that both Europe and Greece are moving ahead very cautiously. The new radical left Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has won a financial lifeline and Greece stays in the eurozone, but he will struggle to deliver on many campaign promises. There will be no new austerity measures but existing measures remain in place and the new government’s hands are tied over how much they can spend on social programmes.

In other news, more than 150 women and children abducted by the Nigerianjihadist group Boko Haram have been reunited with their families. They were kidnapped in north-eastern Nigeria in December. One report says the militants abandoned the hostages in a village, after they were attacked by security forces. The President of Liberia says the country’s borders will reopen on Sunday, after being closed last year due to the Ebola outbreak. In a statement published on her official website, Ellen -- she says nationwide curfews will also be lifted. A series of bomb blasts in Libya has killed at least 40 people and left dozens more injured. A group affiliated to Islamic State has claimed responsibility. The blasts took place in the eastern city of Qubah. Seven days of official mourning have been declared, as Ben Bland reports. The chaotic aftermath of a suicide bombing in the town of Qubbah in eastern Libya. People trying to put out the fire. This attack by a group linked to the so-called Islamic State killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens more. In all, three bombs were set off targeting a petrol station, a police station and the home of the parliamentary speaker. They claimed they had done it in retaliation for the airstrikes by Egypt. Those were carried out after 21 Coptic Christians were murdered by the militants in Libya. Islamic State, seen here parading through the streets, has exploited the instability in Libya since the Colonel Gaddafi was overthrown nearly four years ago. Two rival governments have emerged and the internationally recognised one said it cannot defeat the militants alone. We would need the international community to step up its effort in terms of providing the authorisation needed by the Security Council to equip our army with the adequate weapons and military equipment that would be necessary to fight terrorism. There have been other recent deadly attacks in Libya. just last month gunmen stormed a hotel in Tripoli, killing nine people including foreign nationals. Libya is a state in trouble and for now, there seems to be no end to the chaos and the killing. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: The search for three missing London schoolgirls, feared to be heading to Syria tojoin the terror group Islamic State. Police appeal for them to return home. First, let’s round up the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The Financial Times reports on what it calls the ‘11th hour deal’ between Greece and the eurozone, to extend the country’s 172 billion euro rescue programme for four months. In France, Le Figaro reports a state of emergency after two million people contracted a particularly virulent seasonal flu. The Irish Times has a story on Dublin’s property bubble, saying the recent crash isjust one of many booms and busts in the last 300 years and not even close to being the worst. retake the Iraqi city of Mosul That’s the headline in the International New York Times. The paper says the country’s huge economic growth that’s created opportunities for women has also fostered a return to traditional values. This is BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. The latest headlines: A fire has ripped through the 79-floor Marina Torch tower in Dubai. Authorities say there are no reports of casualties. Hundreds have been evacuated. Eurozone finance ministers have reached an agreement with Greece to extend the country’s bailout deal for four months, to allow time for a review of its austerity measures. The Ukrainian capital Kiev has been marking the first anniversary of the clashes between protesters and police, which toppled the Viktor Yanukovych. One of the towns in golf to buy the insulin Byland is Debaltseve. It has been two days since Russian backed rebels captured the town, forcing government troops to retreat. Paul Adams has been there and found civilians emerging after weeks of fighting. After nine months of this war, the landscape is littered with its remains. Here on the road to Debaltseve, the Ukraine army fought off the rebels for weeks. Three weeks ago the checkpoint fell and the town soon followed. This was a ferocious assault. The Ukrainian soldiers here were overwhelmed. The victors scavenged through the wreckage. Most were from eastern Ukraine but there was one Russian here. The bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lie in the cold, uncollected and ignored three days after they died here. There is exploded ammunition everywhere and mines that need to We move into Debaltseve and the shelling has taken its toll. The town is very quiet. This is the central street in Debaltseve and as you can see it is practically deserted apart from some civilians and some soldiers. This town has not had gas, water or electricity since the New Year. Many people are still living underground and are afraid to come out. We can still hear the sound of occasional fire. This part of Debaltseve is a bit of a ghost town. I think you can see it on my face. We were notjust scared we were in complete shock. Imagine my child, she is scared of everything now. After weeks of living underground, this man has comeback to check on his modest house. A shell exploded outside. His neighbour said they are tired of replacing broken windows. Everything is ruined. The Ukrainian National Guard hit us with shells. Who do you blame for all this destruction? He is clear that it is all the fault of the President of Ukraine. On the road out of Debaltseve, some of the men are leaving with theirjob done. They are confident, but having won will the leaders now agree to stop shooting or have they already decided on the next target? Police have issued an urgent appeal for help in finding three schoolgirls from east London who are believed to be trying to joinjihadists fighting in Syria. The three teenagers flew to Turkey on Tuesday without telling their families. Daniel Sandford has more. Filmed by CCTV cameras at Gatwick Airport as they left Britain on Tuesday morning, three teenage girls - all friends and all in the same year at school. Shamima Begum isjust 15, but could be on her way tojoin the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. With her, her 16-year-old friend Kadiza Sultana. Both are British Bangladeshis and both are successful at school, as was the third friend, who is also 15 - but whose family don’t want to be identified. This afternoon, the head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command appealed for them to come home, or for anyone who sees them to contact the police in Turkey. We are concerned they will go into Syria where, of course, they could be connected with Islamic State, and we are all aware of the treatment of girls and women in that part of Syria. The friends all went to this school - the Bethnal Green Academy - in East London, rated outstanding by Ofsted. This week it’s half term. The girls left their homes early on Tuesday morning, lying to their parents about their plans. At Gatwick, they boarded a Turkish Airlines plane for Istanbul - the same route to Syria taken by a fourth friend - from the same school and in the same year- in December. Though tonight, one of the school’s governors found it hard to believe the girls were really trying to get to Syria. I thought that, first of all, it was a joke, saying that they are off to Syria. But I still don’t believe that they’re going anywhere other than a holiday, because this is how they were dressed and this is how they looked and this is how they packed. by savage winter weather hoping the three schoolgirls haven’t yet made it to the Syrian border. This is the first time that Scotland Yard has gone public with the names of teenage girls who have travelled to Syria. It is a sign of how concerned they are about the girls’ safety and how worried they are about the growing phenomenon ofjihadi brides. It’s thought that more than 50 British women and hundreds from other Western European countries have already travelled to join Islamic State. Many of them are still of school age. Some are encouraged to go there by other women, who have already made the journey. There’s women who are at the forefront of trying to recruit young girls, but there’s also men, older jihadi men, who are befriending these girls on certain sites like jihad Matchmaker and other websites and social media sites and encouraging young girls, befriending them, and doing similar behaving in a similar way to the way child sexual exploiter groomers behave, actually. Tonight, the families of the three girls are said to be desperate-desperate hoping still hoping somebody will stop their daughters crossing the border into Syria, and into the dangerous world of the Islamic State. A convicted member of the Mafia, who’d been living under an assumed name in London for 20 years, has lost the latest stage of his long legal battle against extradition to Italy. Westminster Magistrates’ Court has ruled that Domenico Rancadore, who’s 65, must return to serve a seven year prison sentence. Clive Coleman has more. Domenico Rancadore - a man who does not care for the cameras. How are you feeling? Not well, sorry, no more. Arriving at court with his wife to learn whether he is to be extradited to Italy. Once a teacher known as The Professor, the Italian police say that his crime family was involved in extortion, racketeering and drug trafficking. In 1999, he was convicted in his absence of being a member of the Sicilian Mafia. Back then, he was nowhere to be found. For 20 years, he lived in Uxbridge, west London, under the name Mark Skinner. But Domenico Rancadore’s quiet suburban life came to an abrupt end in August 2013 here, when police turned up with an arrest warrant. His past had finally caught up with him. Father Gino Sachetti spoke out against organised crime in Sicily, and said that he fell foul of Domenico Rancadore and his henchmen. Police rang out the door, they woke us up, and I went downstairs. Police rang at the door, they woke us up, and I went downstairs. I went out the door, the police captain told me, look. I turned to my right, and saw a dead lamb hanging with a sign. My blood froze. I understood that things were taking a turn for the worst. The sign said ""this is how you will end up"". There is no doubt that Domenico Rancadore was an integral part of the threats I received. It is the second time the authorities of Italy have tried to extradite Domenico Rancadore. He argued that amounted to an abuse of the law. Today, the judge disagreed. Domenico Rancadore, what is your reaction to the court’s decision? I’m very disappointed. Are you going to appeal? I don’t want to go to Italy. Do you want to stay with your family? Of course. If his appeal fails, Domenico Rancadore faces several years in an Italianjail. It will be a far cry from Uxbridge. Clive Coleman, BBC News. It’s a night of films, frocks and gushing speeches - and this year’s Oscars on Sunday are sure to live up to expectations. But how much of the awards are based on actual performance? Our Arts Editor, Will Gompertz, has been looking at the lobbying behind the scenes. The glitz and the glamour of the film awards season is about to reach its climax. This is the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood where on Sunday night, film stars and movie moguls will arrive via this soon-to-be-revealed red carpet to find out to whom the 6,000 plus Academy members have decided to award an Oscar. It will bring to an end months of campaigning by producers to make sure their film has had the best possible chance of winning. Obviously they are not allowed to bribe Academy members but some behind-the-scenes lobbying can sail pretty close to the wind. There are screenings and dinners and informal ""get your friends together"". But the Academy tries to control that as much as possible in this phase of the voting. It tries, but it doesn’t always succeed, as this veteran Hollywood producer admits. There is some wining and dining but they have actually stopped that, I wouldn’t say cold, but there is less of it and it is people who will basically screen a movie at their house. I saw one of the movies that way. If you reverse time, then the universe is getting smaller. So the tactics have become more subtle. Competing films, for instance, should be viewed in impartial surroundings which you could argue is difficult to achieve if one of the stars is hanging about before the screening. That is exactly what happened and I happened to like the movie and Eddie Redmayne wasn’t in the room when I saw it. The fact is, I don’t know that I would have said anything different than what I said or felt. I have been called all sorts of things over the years - Sultan of Swag, Gift Guru - but ultimately I’m just a simple guy who gladhanding and sweet-talking by producers promoting their wares is rich and famous to care about being gifted - and the reality is that you are never too rich or famous to enjoy a gift, receiving or giving. And this is the way that many celebrities shop. These are the unofficial £125,000 consolation goody bags that will be given to the stars who go home without a golden statue. Everyone is a winner at the Oscars - proving there really is no business like showbusiness. He’s been watching BBC News, thank you your company. -- you have. Hello there.

Through the day we will continue to see a few showers across northern and western areas, wintry over the higher ground and showers getting into southern and eastern areas as well. Some of them may contain a mixture of hail as well. Sunny spells in between, but feeling chilly - temperatures 4-7 celsius. A cold night and on Saturday morning most of us waking up to a frost. But it will be bright in southern and eastern parts of the UK. Skies turn cloudier across the west as this weather system moves in. Outbreaks of rain and winds as well. Significant snow falling over the higher ground as that rain bumps into the cold air. Accumulations of snow likely across the higher ground of Scotland, particularly across the Highlands and towards the Southern Uplands and snow down to lower levels for a time in the heaviest of the rain. Snowfalls over the higher ground of northern England and maybe for Wales as well. Winds will be quite strong across the Irish Sea coastal areas and heavy rain pushing in there. But the Midlands eastwards having a fine morning with plenty of sunshine after that cold start. It looks like we’ll hold on to the brightness across the extreme south-east of England until later on in the afternoon, when the skies turn cloudy and that rain arrives as well. But out west it will be blustery, heavy rain continuing, and those winds quite a feature, particularly in Northern Ireland in towards western Scotland and Wales. And feeling quite cold and raw. As we head on in towards Monday, you can see tightly packed isobars pushing in off the Atlantic and the blue colours indicating we will stay on the chilly side and all the weather fronts denoting showers. So it will stay quite unsettled into the early part of next week - generally quite cold and windy with some showers, but also some sunshine on the cards, too. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. A fire has broken out in a high-rise tower in Dubai. The blaze was on the upper floors of a 79-storey residential building called The Torch, one of the tallest in the world. It’s now under control and there were no reports of casualties. Eurozone finance ministers have granted Greece a four-month extension of its international bailout. The deal means Greece will stay in the eurozone for now, and will not run out of money next week. The Greek finance minister called it a mutually beneficial agreement. The leaders of France and Germany have renewed calls for a full implementation of the ceasefire deal they helped negotiate for eastern Ukraine. The plea comes amid continuing breaches of the truce in several cities and towns, including the embattled town of Debaltseve. Let’s take a look now at the front pages of some of the morning papers. The Guardian leads with the race to find three schoolgirls who are believed to have fled Britain for Syria. They flew to Istanbul, on a much-used route for those joining the so-called Islamic State. A photo of the three girls is also on the front page of the Times, but the eye-catching title is about finances. The paper says that Labour are planning a tax raid on pensions to fund lower tuition fees. The Independent says that thousands are being unfairly hounded over tax credits by an American services company working for Staying with finances, but of the personal kind, the Telegraph writes of their final salary pensions. The FT examines in detail how Greece and eurozone finance ministers reached an 11th-hour bail out deal. And Daily Express leads with a health story. It reports on a major study which has found that a Mediterranean-style diet may help fight dementia. In Uganda, few people are willing to talk about mental illness. Those who suffer are frequently isolated, shunned by their community and rejected by their families. Our World meets a man who’s broken the silence and is encouraging other psychiatric patients to speak openly about living with mental illness. This programme contains scenes which some viewers may find disturbing. Have you heard about the dilemma? -- the Dalai lama? He says the purpose of life to be happy. When I am singing karaoke I am happy! joseph is a man who is determined to succeed against the odds. He and his friends are ordinary people in an extraordinary situation. They are speaking out about something very few people in that country are willing to talk about. Mental illness. My psychiatrist says I have bipolar. You see howl illness. My psychiatrist says I have bipolar. You see how I become when I relax. You behave like a tiger when you are high. When you are low, you’re like a pussycat. They live in a country with only one psychiatrist for every million people. The traditional ways live on. I, due to come out! But these former patients are trying to find a new way of living. -- I command you. They swapping isolation and prejudice for hope. This is my world. I want to tell you my story about going mad in Uganda and how I’m trying to break the silence around people like me. joseph Atu ku nda joseph Atukunda was studying to become an accountant when something started going wrong with his mind. I went to a shop, bought some rat poison, bought a wrote, put them in mY poison, bought a wrote, put them in my bag and moved on this very field, looking for a place where nobody could interrupt me in order to stop the act. -- bought a rope. I intended to first strip the poison and as the poison was working I would use the rope to hang myself. I was really determined to end my life. Butjoseph had a change of heart. All of a sudden, I got a vision. I don’t know whether from jesus, Krishna, Muhammad orthe Buddha, telling me that I could still seek help. I could turn around, get back onto the taxi going to Kampala, go to a doctor and seek some help. Maybe there is some remedy for what’s happening to you. joseph didn’t understand that his dramatic mood swings was symptoms of bipolar disorder. A serious but treatable mental illness. Help is hard to find in Uganda and those affected are often shunned. This is Kampala’s Butabika hospital. The only psychiatric hospital in the country. joseph has been admitted here many times, and when he had manic episodes he could be aggressive. In most cases people being brought to this ward are violent and brought by police. I would like to show you some of the places where they put us when we are violent. This is called the isolation room. just before you’re put in this room, you’re stripped naked, injected with a lot of medicine. I thought I was in hell. I thought I’d died and I was in hell. I had some sort of hallucination. The hospital says it has cut down on the use of these rooms. Now they are only a last resort. There are 700 inpatients. Men, women and children. patients can be violent. A few have killed. There are also around outpatients every day. It’s an overwhelming workload for the four macro psychiatrists who teach the patients here. -- four. This morning, this doctor, joseph’s psychiatrist, is on duty. The people here have severe mental disturbance, what you call psychosis. With some, the psychosis is related to drug use, others have bipolar, others schizophrenia and then a fuel of the patients have epilepsy with mental retardation. These are the majority of patients we have here. The hospital is free, money for treatment is very tight. The staff say they are overworked, but they do the best they can for their patients. But there is an overwhelming reliance on medication. Yes, we tend to use large doses of medication on the ward and give the patient’s control and then we manage the side-effects. They feel extremely sedated, weak and unstable. They can’t walk very steadily. Everyday, more patients are brought in. This man, after a journey of three hours from his village where he had been causing a disturbance. He has a chronic problem, from the degree of self-neglect. He is quite hot and collapsed, so we definitely have to give him fluids first when he goes to the ward. In some ways this man is lucky. He’s now getting treatment. Hello! How will you? Most mentally ill people here never go to hospital, but they may go to a traditional healer. It should be around here. Look. As many as 90% of people in Uganda are thought to be living with -- are thought to think mental illness is linked to witchcraft or curses. All of these structures are part of the Shrine houses, where the treatments are done. He’s coming. He’s not in sight here. -- inside. Hallo,... You remember me? -- hello, doctor. How why you? You are back. I’m back to show them where I was treated. Yes. And maybe you can give us an explanation about some of the treatments here that you give. Thanks very much. Do you want to ask me? Maybe you could tell me more. After I left here, I didn’t know how your medication works. I treated you by tying up your hands, by putting medicine in your nose, by cutting lines in your head, by slaughtering a cock on your head, with your head covered in blood, so I could debut with medicine. Were you treating spirits? Was I possessed by some spirits or were you just treating an illness? Definitely you had some spirits. I have to kill them. illness? Definitely you had some spirits. I have to killthem. Here, I can kill spirits, as you are killing... Life? Yes. Some devils were on your head, talking so many languages, different languages. You could not understand who is your mother, who is your father. You could walk naked, but all this was covered by any. I remember! could walk naked, but all this was covered by any. I remember I even broke the chain. -- covered by me. He mainly uses powers and infusions but these herbal medicines are not his most powerful remedy. Now we are going to the place where we remove devils from our patients. Now what we shall give her time to undress herself. we use this cock is because all devils speak. As they speak they have power. You can see You Cai’! SEE I’IOW i’IOW You can see now how the patient is bathing herself, begging for good spirits to come on her. joseph went through the same ritual with this doctor. He’s in two minds about whether it helped him or not. Everything in this mind has advantages and disadvantages. I was treated in the spiritual healer’s crude structures and methods that you see here, but I am well now. Even conventional medicine has its advantages and disadvantages. Sol can’t quite discard this spiritual healer who somebody -- as somebody who didn’t contribute at all to my wellness. As well of the challenge of getting medical help, people like joseph says another serious problem. At certain times in my life, Ifelt so lonely, surrounded by people, but they are going about their own lives, they are not noticing the turmoil you are going through. You feel so lonely at times, all by yourself. Inside of there. It can even be hard for his family to breakthrough. Thank you God for everything. Our men. joseph has four children. jennifer, james, joshua and jordan. children. jennifer, james, joshua andjordan. His wife, Harriet, says that when he hits a low, everyone feels pressure. Sometimes, it is hard. But I try to make it easier. I talked to him. If he is sick, I tell him to go to the hospital and take his medication, he takes it. Making him happy, Italked his medication, he takes it. Making him happy, I talked to him, and you persuade and convince him. -- talk. Sometimes, you get challenges. joseph is lucky. He has Harriet. The doctors say that many of the people with mental illness are rejected by their families. When that happens, the church may be the only place to go. just outside of Kampala is a Pentecostal glory ministry. Some of joseph ‘s friends have been brought here. It is run by a charismatic pastor, jeffrey. He takes in the sick and the abandoned. But his regime is strict. This woman will be kept shackled until the power of prayer has taken effect. She is still violent, so that is why we chain her. These people are rejected from their family because they are marked. She has been abandoned. She is totally abandoned on the pasta. He will not take her to see a psychiatrist -- pastor. For us who have seen the power of God, we are not doctors, but we pray and wait for God ‘s power, and let him deliver. That is why we do not take them to hospital. This is why we keep on praying for them. And get the deliverance. He believes that deliverance comes through to drive out the evil spirits. In the name of jesus, from today, I lifted from the power of darkness. I am setting new three. I command you. -- setting you free. No, stop! Icommand you three. I command you. -- setting you free. No, stop! I command you to come out. You have nothing to do with her. In the name ofjesus... Pastorjeffrey repeats this ritual daily on the members of the congregation he is trying to heal. Backin congregation he is trying to heal. Back in Kampala, joseph has an appointment at the hospital. In the past, he tried the church. He said it did not work for him. He’s decided to put his trust in modern medicine and receives a monthly dose joseph. He says his life is better now. Good, thank you. And he has taken up swimming to help him relax. But what has really made a difference is Billy Peterkin to the unknown. He changed his attitude to his own mental condition by talking openly about it, and says it has turned his life around. -- is his leap into the unknown. This is good exercise X-Pac but it is killing me! (LAUGHTER) -- this is good exercise! Now he shares his experiences with other former patients who have become his friends. Thank you, the swimming was nice. You have to keep practising. It is quite enjoyable, by the way. It is an opportunity to talk about what troubles them. I think locally, people say you are mad, you are useless. You people say yOU aI’â ITIad, yOU aI’â useless. You aI’â I’IO people say you are mad, you are useless. You are no help to society. But where I come from, people say you are the walking dead, useless, you are as good as dead. Another type of stigma is people fearing you. For example, for me, when I am walking on the street at home, there are some people who will see me coming and they branch. -- and they branch off. They don’t want to meet me, they have no experience that I have beaten someone. But theyjust fear, completely, with no compromise. In a country where the law still refers to people with mental illness as ""idiots"", the stigma is hard to overcome. So, joseph and his friends have set up a small support group which they have called heart songs"". They work in partnership with the hospital. Peer support is very important, and it is something that should be given a lot of attention. The patients themselves support each other, because we are experts by experience. We understand deep inside which happens -- what happens, which of the psychologists and psychiatrists are good. We can give solace to each other. When we meet like this, I know everyone has the same problem, and we live like other people. Nobody can tell that this person is suffering from mental illness. We are doing well. We are sharing. I am feeling very happy because of that. My psychiatrist says I have bipolar. So, from my life experiences, I go through highs and lows. I think I’ve relapsed in the presence of many of you. You see how I become when I relapse. Your eyes go black. You behave like a tiger when you relapse. When you are low, you are like a pussycat. Sure. That is what I observe. Have you heard about the Dalai llama? He is a spiritual leader. He said the purpose of life is to be happy. Now, by the way, a normal person who has never suffered from a mental illness, who is not happy, I would not be that person, I would rather be me. I may have suffered from mental illness but I am happy. When I am singing karaoke, I am happy, and the purpose life is to be happy. Karaoke! The World Health Organisation estimates that over 90% of people with mental disorders in Uganda did not receive medical help. Karaoke! Forthose Uganda did not receive medical help. Karaoke! For those who do, psychiatrist says support group like -- support groups like joseph’s can increase the chances of staying well. Thank you so much, thank you. Let’s get the big man in the building tonight. A big round of applause. Hello, hello, hello my dearfriends! Karaoke of the highest order! This is psychosocial support. It will produce a zombie, somebody needs to be supportive he feels like a person here in this group, and here we are all normal. -- who feels. So what is most important is we should not feel sorry for ourselves. To say that I am sick, I cannot do this. We try to share with each other and encourage each other. To have a better life. (SINGING). I believe in Mum and dad... And I believe in you. Hello there. The weekend is virtually upon us and I think, for most of us, Saturday is shaping up to be the best day of the weekend with regards to dryer, brighter weather. There will be some wintry showers around - particularly wintry across the north and west of the UK. Into Sunday, it starts off very cold - bright with some sunshine, but turning wet and windy as the day progresses, with some snow in the north. Through the course of tonight it will remain quite cold across many areas and where we have showers across northern and western areas, there is a significant risk of ice towards the end of the night. These are towns and city temperatures, which are lower than this - particularly in the north. This is the big picture. North-easterly winds bringing in a feed of showers. This weather front may enhance showers across Scotland through the course of Saturday, but there will be a good deal of dry and bright weather as well. So a cold start for most places. Variable amounts of showers, a few cloudy and sunny spells. Through the day we will continue to see a few showers across northern and western areas, wintry over the higher ground and showers getting into southern and eastern areas as well.

Our top stories: A fire has ripped through one of the tallest residential buildings in Dubai, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people. It’s now under control. There are no reports of any casualties. After a day of crisis talks, Greece gets a bailout extension - but there are strings attached. Attacks in Libya kill more than 40 people - Hello and welcome. We begin in Dubai, where a fire that ripped through the Marina Torch Tower has been brought under control. Strong winds helped to spread the blaze across the 336m tall residential building. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the tower, but there are no reports of any casualties. Ben Bland has this report. The torched skyscraper in Dubai alight after a fire broke out on the 50th floor. This footage captured by an eyewitness - flaming bits of debris and glass falling to the ground. The 79-floor building was evacuated and, remarkably, there were initially no reports of any casualties. It was about 2:30 and the alarm went off. A lot of times we’ve had it go off where it was the false alarm, so we didn’t think much of it. And then they actually came around pounding on our door and telling us to get out. So that’s when we knew to leave. The tower is one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, standing at more than 1,000ft high. Its website describes it as one of the most popular in Dubai Marina, close to both the business district and the beach. A two-bedroom apartment starts at more than US$500,000. It’s not yet clear what caused the fire, which started in the early hours of Saturday morning local time. Nearby skyscrapers were also evacuated and roads closed as a precaution. We werejust going back roads closed as a precaution. We were just going back home, then we see so many police cars on the road, so I think they blocked the road now. We can’t go back to our apartment. So I guess we have to stick on the street or something. It took more than 12 fire engines to put the fire out - the task made more difficult by strong winds which had fanned the flames. Some residents have been told it’ll be days before they can get back in. A little while ago, I spoke to Kathryn Dickie, who lives in the Marina Torch Tower. She described what happened. After about 2:00am this morning, the fire alarm started to go off. Within three or four minutes, security guards were banging on our doors and ringing our door bell, and telling us there was a fire and we needed to get out quickly. So everyone literally went straight to the fire escapes and started going down - some people hadn’t even taken time to put on clothes, just wearing towels. Everyone watt getting out as quickly as they could. How long did it take the emergency services to get there? By the time I got downstairs - I’m on the 13th floor, so it wasn’t too long - about four storeys were completely ablaze on one side, and I saw maybe one fire truck and police cars were starting to arrive. But at that point, it was really just a to arrive. But at that point, it was reallyjust a building-- to arrive. But at that point, it was reallyjust a building -- just building security who were dealing with the evacuation. We’ve been hearing that strong winds were helping to spread the blaze, and we’re looking at some amateur footage now ofjust huge scenes... I don’t know if you can even hear the whistling behind me, because I’m in the 57th floor of another building now, but the wind is so strong today, and there were pieces - the buildings are covered in panels, and they’re about a metre tall each. Those panels were catching fire and then coming off the building and being picked up by the wind, and they were falling down to the street still aflame - they weren’t going out, or they were actually knocking onto the buildings across the road, um, which was actually really scary, and we all kept moving back further and further down the street because the debris was starting to fall down everywhere. You’re on the 13th floor and the fire started around the 50th. Do you have any idea when you’ll be able to go back home? Absolutely no idea at all. I mean, by the time the fire was put out and it had reached almost the very top floor of the building on one side and I also heard that a piece of debris had fallen onto the 20th floor, and I could see that on social media, I really don’t know what sort of damage has been done. But the buildings this big - if the lift is damaged by fire or taken out, you really can’t get access, evenif out, you really can’t get access, even if the apartments were sound to go back into. After intensive talks in Brussels, a deal has been reached to extend Greece’s bailout. It’s subject to Athens producing a list of economic reforms by Monday, which will have to be approved by its creditors. The breakthrough came after a standoff between Greece Here’s our Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt. This was the third time that the eurozone’s finance ministers had sat around the table. The tensions and strains were growing. The Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said they had gone the extra ten miles to satisfy their creditors. But German Finance Minister had rejected the Greek plan to extend the bailout. But enormous pressures were building to strike a deal- evenif were building to strike a deal- even if many of the details will be worked out in the weeks and months ahead. Tonight was a first step in this process of rebuilding trust. As you know, trust comes - or leaves - quicker than it comes. The Greeks had to make concessions - no rolling back of reforms, no unilateral actions that might impact on the budget, all debts to be honoured. The Greek government said they had turned a page. We stood upright from the beginning of the negotiations to the very end, especially when faced by immense pressure. And we showed that we were committed to skilful negotiations for the purpose of achieving a mutually beneficial agreement between us and our European partners. To seal this new agreement, Greece will have to draw UP agreement, Greece will have to draw up a list of reforms by Monday, and they’ll have to be based upon the existing bailout agreement. Only then will the deal be finalised by eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday - it is Minister Alexis Tsipras has won a financial lifeline, promises. There will be no new austerity measures, but existing measures remain in place, and the new government’s hands are tied over how much it can spend on social programmes.

There, you’ll find the latest news and analysis, including more background on the Greek debt crisis: In other news: More than 150 women and children abducted by the Nigerianjihadist group Boko Haram have been reunited with their families. They were kidnapped in Yobe state in north-eastern Nigeria in December. One report says the militants abandoned the hostages in a village after they were attacked by security forces. The Somali jihadist groupal Shabaab has carried out a double suicide attack on a hotel in the capital, Mogadishu. The authorities say at least ten people have been killed, including two MPs and the city’s deputy mayor. The deputy prime minister and two other ministers were wounded in the attack, which came during Friday prayers. A series of bomb blasts in Libya has killed at least 40 people and left dozens more injured. A group affiliated to Islamic State has claimed responsibility. The blasts took place in the eastern city of Qubbah. Seven days of official mourning have been declared, as Donna Larsen reports. The chaotic aftermath of a suicide bombing in the town of Oubbah, in eastern Libya. People trying to put out the fire. This attack by a group linked to the so-called Islamic State, killed at least 40 people, leaving dozens more wounded. In all, three bombs were set off, targeting a petrol station, a police station, and the home of the parliamentary speaker. They claimed they had done it in retaliation for the air strikes in Egypt. Those strikes were carried out after 21 Coptic Christians were murdered by the militants in Libya. IS, seen here apparently parading through the streets of SERT, has exploited the instability in Libya since Colonel Gaddafi was overthrown nearly four years ago. Two rival governments have emerged - the internationally recognised one says it cannot defeat the militants alone. We would need the national committee -- the international community to step up its efforts in terms of providing the authorisation that are needed at the Security Council to equip the Libyan army with the adequate weapons and military equipment that would be necessary to fight terrorism. There have been other recent deadly attacks in Libya. just last month, gunmen stormed the Cinthia Hotel in Tripoli, killing nine people, including some foreign nationals. Libya is clearly a state in trouble, and for now, there is no obvious end in sight to the chaos and the killing. The Ukrainian capital, Kiev, has been marking the first anniversary of the clashes between protesters and police which toppled ex-president Viktor Yanukovych. One of the towns engulfed by the ensuing violence is Debaltseve. It’s been two days since Russian-backed rebels recaptured the strategically important town, forcing government troops to retreat. Our correspondent, Paul Adams, has been to Debaltseve and found civilians emerging after weeks of fighting. After nine months of this war, the landscape is littered with its remains. Here on the road to Debaltseve, the Ukraine army fought off the rebels for weeks. Three weeks ago the checkpoint fell and the town soon followed. This was a ferocious assault. The Ukrainian soldiers here were overwhelmed. The victors scavenged through the wreckage. Most were from eastern Ukraine but there was one Russian here. The bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lie in the cold, uncollected and ignored three days after they died here. There is exploded ammunition everywhere and mines that need to We move into Debaltseve and the shelling has taken its toll. The town is very quiet. This is the central street in Debaltseve and as you can see it is practically deserted apart from some civilians and some soldiers. This town has not had gas, water or electricity since the New Year. Many people are still living underground and are afraid to come out. We can still hear the sound of occasional fire. This part of Debaltseve is a bit of a ghost town. I think you can see it on my face. We were notjust scared we were in complete shock. Imagine my child, she is scared of everything now. After weeks of living underground, this man has comeback to check on his modest house. A shell exploded outside. His neighbour said they are tired of replacing broken windows. Everything is ruined. The Ukrainian National Guard hit us with shells. Who do you blame for all this destruction? He is clear that it is all the fault of the President of Ukraine. On the road out of Debaltseve, some of the men are leaving with agree to stop shooting or have they already decided on the next target? Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: The search for three missing London schoolgirls feared to be heading to Syria to join the terror group Islamic State. Police appeal for them to return home. First, let’s round up the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The Financial Times reports on what it calls the ""eleventh-hour deal"" between Greece and the eurozone to extend the country’s 172 billion euro rescue programme for four months. In France, Le Figaro reports a state of emergency after 2 million people contracted a particularly virulent seasonal flu. The Irish Times has a story on Dublin’s property bubble, saying the recent crash isjust one of many booms and busts in the last 300 years, and not even close to being the worst. The Straits Times reports on plans of a new offensive to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State militants. And ""Boom in China leaves women behind"": That’s the headline in The International New York Times. The paper says the country’s huge economic growth that’s created opportunities for women has also fostered a return to traditional values. This is BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. The latest headlines: A fire has ripped through the 79-floor Marina Torch Tower in Dubai. Authorities say there are no reports of casualties - hundreds have been evacuated. Eurozone finance ministers have reached an agreement with Greece to extend the country’s bailout deal for four months, to allow time for a review of its austerity measures. Police have issued an urgent appeal for help in finding three schoolgirls from East London who are believed to be trying to joinjihadists fighting in Syria. The three teenagers flew to Turkey on Tuesday without telling their families. Daniel Sandford has more. Filmed by CCTV cameras at Gatwick Airport as they left Britain on Tuesday morning, three teenage girls - all friends and all in the same year at school. Shamima Begum isjust 15, but could be on her way tojoin the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. With her, her 16-year-old friend Kadiza Sultana. Both are British Bangladeshis and both are successful at school, as was the third friend, who is also 15 - but whose family don’t want to be identified. This afternoon, the head of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command appealed for them to come home, or for anyone who sees them to contact the police in Turkey. We are concerned they will go into Syria where, of course, they could be connected with Islamic State, and we are all aware of the treatment of girls and women in that part of Syria. The friends all went to this school - the Bethnal Green Academy - in East London, rated outstanding by Ofsted. This week it’s half term. The girls left their homes early on Tuesday morning, lying to their parents about their plans. At Gatwick, they boarded a Turkish Airlines plane for Istanbul - the same route to Syria taken by a fourth friend - from the same school and in the same year- in December. Though tonight, one of the school’s governors found it hard to believe the girls were really trying to get to Syria. I thought that, first of all, it was a joke, saying that they are off to Syria. But I still don’t believe that they’re going anywhere other than a holiday, because this is how they were dressed and this is how they looked and this is how they packed. Luckily for British police, Turkey is being plagued by savage winter weather and travel chaos, so detectives are hoping the three schoolgirls haven’t yet made it to the Syrian border. This is the first time that Scotland Yard has gone public with the names of teenage girls who have travelled to Syria. It is a sign of how concerned they are about the girls’ safety and how worried they are about the growing phenomenon ofjihadi brides. It’s thought that more than 50 British women and hundreds from other Western European countries have already travelled to join Islamic State. Many of them are still of school age. Some are encouraged to go there by other women, who have already made the journey. There’s women who are at the forefront of trying to recruit young girls, but there’s also men, older jihadi men, who are befriending these girls on certain sites like jihad Matchmaker and other websites and social media sites and encouraging young girls, befriending them, and doing similar behaving in a similar way to the way child sexual exploiter groomers behave, actually. Tonight, the families of the three girls are said to be desperate-desperate hoping still hoping somebody will stop their daughters crossing the border into Syria, and into the dangerous world of the Islamic State . Let’s go back to Islamic State. Let’s go back to our top story of the Marina Torch Hotel on fire. It has been brought under control. We will speak to our correspondent, thanks forjoining correspondent, thanks for joining us. correspondent, thanks forjoining us. We’ve looked at photos of this massive fire - it seems that we’ve lost Lars, Ido apologise. massive fire - it seems that we’ve lost Lars, I do apologise. But we can see some pictures that he that ripped through the Marina Torch Tower. It has now been brought under control and there are no casualties. We’ll come back to that story. It’s a night of films, frocks and gushing speeches - and this year’s Oscars on Sunday are sure to live up to expectations. But how much of the awards are based on actual performance? Our Arts Editor, Will Gompertz, has been looking at the lobbying behind the scenes. The glitz and the glamour of the film awards season is about to reach its climax. This is the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood where on Sunday night, film stars and movie moguls will arrive via this soon-to-be-revealed red carpet to find out to whom the 6,000 plus Academy members have decided to award an Oscar. It will bring to an end months of campaigning by producers to make sure their film has had the best possible chance of winning. Obviously they are not allowed to bribe Academy members but some behind-the-scenes lobbying can sail pretty close to the wind. There are screenings and dinners and informal ""get your friends together"". But the Academy tries to control that as much as possible in this phase of the voting. It tries, but it doesn’t always succeed, as this veteran Hollywood producer admits. There is some wining and dining but they have actually stopped that, I wouldn’t say cold, but there is less of it and it is people who will basically screen a movie at their house. I saw one of the movies that way. If you reverse time, then the universe is getting smaller. So the tactics have become more subtle. Competing films, for instance, should be viewed in impartial surroundings which you could argue is difficult to achieve if one of the stars is hanging about before the screening. That is exactly what happened and I happened to like the movie and Eddie Redmayne wasn’t in the room when I saw it. The fact is, I don’t know that I would have said anything different than what I said or felt. I have been called all sorts of things over the years - Sultan of Swag, Gift Guru - but ultimately I’m just a simple guy who loves hooking up celebrities with incredible products that I love. The truth is, the Oscars are all about marketing and any gladhanding and sweet-talking by producers promoting their wares is more than matched by international brands pushing theirs. I think the misperception about celebrities is that they are too rich and famous to care about being gifted - and the reality is that you are never too rich or famous to enjoy a gift, receiving or giving. And this is the way that many celebrities shop. These are the unofficial £125,000 consolation goody bags that will be given to the stars who go home without a golden statue. Everyone is a winner at the Oscars - proving there really is no business like showbusiness. Well e let’s go back to our top story now and try to speak to Lars in Dubai. Are you there? Yes, I’m here, yes. So we have been showing photos of this massive fire. It seems incredible that there was no-one hurt. Tell us what you saw? Yeah, we woke up early - my daughter woke us up because we saw the light from the flames. We live on the 50th floor, just across the road, so the light was coming into our windows, basically, from the fire. And it was scary, of course, debris was flying around. So we went down - we were not evacuated, but we decided, from a safety point of view, to go with the whole family down to the ground floor, and there we saw all the fire engines, ambulances, comingjust in front of our building. Looking at the footage that you sent in to us, so you were evacuated from a nearby building. Have you now been allowed to go back home? Yeah, I mean, we were not evacuated - we decided by ourselves just to leave. And we were outside just because it felt safer, for about two hours, and then we went back.ment so we have been back, now, four or five hours went back.ment so we have been back, now, four orfive hours in our building. And what he is a the atmosphere like there? Because I understand that it’s quite a densely populated residential area? understand that it’s quite a densely populated residentialarea? Lots populated residential area? Lots of very tall buildings - and you yourself live in one of these buildings. What is the atmosphere like? Yeah, of course, you know, yesterday it was a bit scary, also, because it was really windy, and you could see a lot of debris and burning materialflying could see a lot of debris and burning material flying around burning materialflying around in the area, and, yeah, it’s - it’s scary, of course. But, we feel safe anyway, and the fire department came quickly and they managed to stop the fire, surprisingly quickly. Yes, it seems like the emergency services reacted very quickly. Tell me, do you have fire drills often where you are? We had one, I think, you have fire drills often where you are? We had one, Ithink, a are? We had one, I think, a couple of years ago, a year and a half ago. And I heard about other fires. of years ago, a year and a half ago. And I heard about otherfires. We have seen one building not far away where there was a fire, and of course we read about other fires in other areas of the city. And you and your family, you know, you came out of your building and you are safe, but how comfortable do you feel living in safe anyway. I mean, there are escalators - well, it is a long walk of 50 floors, but there are also six elevators and fire alarms that we trust are working. And sprinkler systems installed in our building. Thank you so much for speaking to us. That’s it from BBC News, hopefully see you soon. Hello there. The weekend is virtually upon us and I think, for most of us, Saturday is shaping up to be the best day of the weekend with regards to dryer, brighter weather. There will be some wintry showers around - particularly wintry across the north and west of the UK. Into Sunday, it starts off very cold - bright with some sunshine, but turning wet and windy as the day progresses, with some snow in the north. Through the course of tonight it will remain quite cold across many areas and where we have showers across northern and western areas, there is a significant risk of ice towards the end of the night. These are towns and city temperatures - lower than this in some rural spots, particularly in the north. This is the big picture. North-westerly winds bringing in a feed of showers. This weather front may enhance showers across Scotland through the course of Saturday, but there will be a good deal of dry and bright weather as well. So a cold start for most places. Variable amounts of showers, a few cloudy and sunny spells. Through the day we will continue to see a few showers across northern and western areas, wintry over the higher ground and showers getting into southern and eastern areas as well. Some of them may contain a mixture of hail as well. Sunny spells in between, but feeling chilly - temperatures 4-7 celsius. A cold night and on Saturday morning most of us waking up to a frost. But it will be bright in southern and eastern parts of the UK. Skies turn cloudier across the west as this weather system moves in. Outbreaks of rain and winds as well. Significant snow falling over the higher ground as that rain bumps into the cold air. Accumulations of snow likely across the higher ground of Scotland, particularly across the Highlands and towards the Southern Uplands and snow down to lower levels for a time in the heaviest of the rain. Snowfalls over the higher ground of northern England and maybe for Wales as well. Winds will be quite strong across the Irish Sea coastal areas and heavy rain pushing in there. But the Midlands eastwards having a fine morning with plenty of sunshine after that cold start. It looks like we’ll hold on to the brightness across the extreme south-east of England until later on in the afternoon, when the skies turn cloudy and that rain arrives as well. But out west it will be blustery, heavy rain continuing, and those winds quite a feature, particularly in Northern Ireland in towards western Scotland and Wales. And feeling quite cold and raw. As we head on in towards Monday, you can see tightly packed isobars pushing in off the Atlantic and the blue colours indicating we will stay on the chilly side and all the weather fronts denoting showers. So it will stay quite unsettled into the early part of next week - generally quite cold and windy with some showers, but also some sunshine on the cards, too. The latest headlines from BBC News: A fire has broken out in a high-rise tower in Dubai. The blaze was on the upper floors of a 79-storey residential building called ""The Torch"" - one of the tallest in the world. It’s now under control. The building is more than 300m tall. There are no reports of any casualties. Eurozone finance ministers have granted Greece a four-month extension of its international bailout. The deal means Greece will stay in the eurozone for now, and will not run out of money next week. The Greek Finance Minister called it a ""mutually beneficial agreement"". A series of bomb blasts in Libya have killed at least 40 people and injured dozens more in the eastern city of Qubbah. A group affiliated with Islamic State has claimed responsibility, saying the attacks are in response to recent air strikes by Egyptian forces in Libya. A group of disabled performers from North Korea are visiting Britain as part of a European tour. It’s believed to be the first time any disabled musicians have performed outside the secretive state. Sarah Campbell went to meet them in Oxford. 13-year-old jin Bom lost his leg three years ago in a car accident. For all but one of the students, this is their first time out of North Korea. I asked a do. I will prove that through this performance. We should organise more can perform and we can do stuff like others, like ordinary people. Discovering the correct answer about any aspect of North Korea is almost impossible. Foreign filming is generally under cover, and few dare to speak out against the regime. Those that do tell a very different story to the carefully controlled images which are allowed to be filmed. If you have a disabled child born to you, the authorities will come to you and try to remove that child from you, or expel you from Pyongyang to the countryside, where conditions are very much harder. These sorts of things are unverified, but they are from a number of sources. That is disputed by the group behind this trip - a group which is supported financially by the North Korean government. There are some rumours against the disability interference of our country. I would like to introduce the reality of my country on the disability issues. So you contend that these rumours are not true? Not true. All of the performers here have a disability and talk very positively about their treatment in North Korea. The organisers are keen to stress that these aren’t all students from privileged backgrounds. But the fact is that very few ordinary North Koreans would ever be allowed out of the country. Now on BBC News, it’s time for The Travel Show. They say everything’s bigger in America, and that’s certainly true when it comes to their love of cars. In the US, they are so much more thanjust a means of In the US, they are so much more than just a means of getting from A to B. With more cars and trucks than drivers, this country has a history and culture that’s been shaped by the humble automobile. We’re here to find out why! Engines revving ENGINES REVVING Hello, and welcome to The Travel Show, coming from the American Midwest. This week, we’re off on a bit of a road trip to discover how this country has been shaped, and some might say even dominated, by one simple machine - the motor car. It’s almost impossible to come to the US as a traveller and not see the huge impact of car culture. In this century, America has become a nation on wheels... On this road trip, I’ll be driving from the prairie state of Illinois up through Michigan and onto Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I’m trying to find out why this country has so fallen for the humble automobile, and to see for myself how cars play an important role in US life. It’s an American thing. Everybody likes their car. Everybody wants to go fast. On myjourney, On my journey, I’ll four-wheeled celebrities, and even get to take one for a spin. It’s certainly the most interesting car I’ve ever driven! I’ll explore America’s seemingly unquenchable need for speed... ..and I’ll see for myself how changes in the car industry have had a huge impact on Motor City, Detroit. The floors are buckled, there’s glass everywhere. An extraordinary sight. But first, I’m taking a drive on a road that embodies why America fell in love with its cars. It’s known as the Mother Road - Route 66. At well over 2,000 miles long, Route 66 stretched from Chicago in the north right through to Los Angeles in the west. It hasn’t actually been an official highway for three decades now, but the road still resonates with the people of America. To find out why, I’ve come to a festival thrown in its honour. There are so -i-i’IâIââ aI’â SO ITIaI’Iy CaI’S There are so many cars here that really evoke the spirit of the heyday of Route 66, like Thunderbirds and Hot Rods and Cadillacs - it really underlines the obsession that this country has with their automobiles. obsession that this country has with theirautomobiles. So, their automobiles. So, what made this road so famous, and what can it tell us about America’s love of cars? It never intended -- never was intended to be what it is today. They needed a road that was a hard road - paved, in one form or another. So they took pieces of road that were already paved, and they attached them. Ah, but this made all kinds of curves and hairpin turns, making Route 66 known as Bloody 66. It was a dangerous road to drive. But it was paved - wow! In 1938, Route 66 became the first highway in the United States to be completely paved. With these new highways come new advances in engineering and, above all, the savings of man’s greatest asset - time. This new modern highway became a vital road for those travelling west in search of a new life. And as the US’s economy rocketed after years of depression, Route 66 - and the cars that drove on it - began to embody the freedom that the American dream offered. It ordinary road. But there is something also a prime example ofjust what a powerful force this love of cars can be for US tourism. Like in Atlanta, Illinois. Ten years ago, the main street of this little town was in serious decline, and lots of these shops and businesses were boarded up. Today, it’s undergoing a revival, and it’s all thanks to Route 66. I’ve come to meet Atlanta local Bill Thomas at The Retro Palm Grills Cafe. So what’s the importance of Route 66 to this town? It has helped saveit Route 66 to this town? It has helped save it economically. This building was actually ready to fall down, and we needed to save it somehow, and all of a sudden it dawned on us - ""Oh, my gosh. We have a tremendous potential asset in this strip of highway that runs right through the middle of our community."" The potential for Route 66 tourism kicked the town into action. A museum was set up, and this cafe was rebuilt exactly like it was in 1934 - right down to the smallest detail. Our goal is, when a tourist walks in the door, we want them to feel like they’ve been taken back in time. Before 2009, when the cafe opened, we didn’t have tourists coming to Atlanta. This year, we’ve had well over 3,000 tourists come. And what would a visit to a classic diner be without a slice of homemade apple pie? Pie? So pie? So this is like the ultimate American dish, isn’t it? It doesn’t get any more American than apple pie! That’s pretty good... The diner has been a huge success for Atlanta, and it’s a recipe that’s been replicated all the way along the road - in fact, it’s estimated that tourists spend $38 million each year along this decommissioned highway. But while some sites thrive, others have gone to ruin. This used to be known asjohn’s Modern Cabins - which, if you look at it today, seems rather ironic. Believe it or not, it was a Route 66 hot spot. Travellers would come to places like these to break up their journey along the main road. Route 66 had become a victim of its own success - by the ‘50s, the road was bumper to success - by the ‘50s, the road was bumperto bumper. In success - by the ‘50s, the road was bumper to bumper. Infact, bumperto bumper. Infact, America’s whole highway network needed updating, and in 1956, plans fora new interstate system were announced. We are gathered here today to dedicate a new highway, one segment of a great national system of highway, that one day soon will connect the major cities of our land. With many travellers taking the faster interstates, tourist spots like this found themselves cut off from the travellers that they needed to survive. The site was abandoned in the 1970s. Pretty soon, I can imagine it will be completely collapsed. But for now, there’s this kind of eerie reminder of the glory days of Route 66. It was the end of an era for this legendary highway, but America’s love of the open road had just begun. Over the decades, cars have influenced so many aspects of life here, from its sprawling cities to vast suburban shopping malls, modern America is built around automobiles. And what’s more, they’ve become far more thanjust a mode of And what’s more, they’ve become far more than just a mode of transport. I’ve left Route 66 and come to the very western edge of Illinois. This is Cordova Dragway Park, where locals come to drive in their own cars in a straight line as fast as they can go. This is a drag strip, and we race 1320ft, which is a quarter mile. To improve your speed by - it sounds ridiculous, but by a tenth of a second - is tremendous. The cars that are lining up to race aren’t being driven by professional racers - these guys have paid to come here. And there’s something rather striking about some of their ages. Hello! OK, I have to ask - how old are you? 16. Oh, my goodness! I’m in high school still. How old are you? 16. No way! Is this your truck? Yep. This is my grandpa’s. He’s let you bring his car out here? Yep. Does he know without it? Yes, he does. It’s better to do it out here than on the road. The purpose is to get street racers off the street. But we give them a very safe, controlled place hobbies, I have mine, and mine’s just being here on the coldest night of the year so far! Scenes like this are happening right across the country, and it’s notjust drag racing. Whether it’s gigantic monster strucks performing acrobatics or NASCAR racing, a sport that’s claimed to be second only to American football in its number of US fans... ..the thrills offered up by what might seem to be just a simple mode of transport have become a big part of life for many Americans. Man, it’sjust gotta be American spirit, I guess. We’ve got gas in ourveins! American spirit, I guess. We’ve got gas in our veins! Coming up on The Travel Show: We’ll explore the troubled history of a city that was once the powerhouse of the US car industry. And: I get taken for a spin in the car of the future - or, should I say, by the car of the future? exploring the US and its love affair with cars. My next stop is the village of Volo, 50 miles north of Chicago. I’m here to see a remarkable collection of automobiles - one that shows us how the car has taken pride of place in American culture. We’ve got Stephen King’s killer car, Christine, Kit from the TV series Knight Rider and my personal favourite, the DeLorean from Back To The Future. This is the Volo Auto Museum and it is choke-full of celebrity cars. What’s more, most of them are still in running order. And allegation, as a special treat, they are letting me get behind the wheel of a true icon of American culture. So this is probably the first time I’ll get to say this and really mean it - to the Bat Mobile! I’m not nervous about driving the Batmobile, come on! Playing Robin to my Batman is Brian Grams. Well, not off to the smoothest of starts. People are more friendly when you are in the Batmobile - they’ll stop for you. Younger viewers may be a little bit confused here, because this doesn’t look anything like the Batmobile they’ve seen in the movies. This is from the original 1960s series starring Adam West. And even five decades later, this famous car can still turn heads. Every single person who has passed us is giving us a big smile! This car has become more famous than the actor who drove it. If you park this in a parking lot, there’s a brand new Lamborghini, people will walk past the Lamborghini to see this car. I bet they will! There’s something satisfying about that. Right here? Americans no longer see cars asjust machines. It is certainly the most interesting carl machines. It is certainly the most interesting car I have ever driven. They’ve become characters with personalities of their own. Best thing ever! So far on myjourney we’ve seep how automobiles have played vital role in America’s history and its culture. So it is probably not surprising that the US is a car manufacturing powerhouse, too, second only to China. But it hasn’t all been smooth sailing. My next stop was once one of the wealthiest cities in America - but today it is in serious trouble. This is Detroit, also known as Motor City, and with good reason. In the first half of the 20th century, 125 car companies were based here. VOICEOVER: Detroit today stands at the threshold of a bright new future. In the 50s and 60s, this city was a paragon of capitalist progress, thanks to the motor trade. But the glory days couldn’t last forever. Smaller manufacturers were pushed out of business and those that survived used increasingly automated production lines. Soon, the work dried up, and residents began to abandon Detroit in droves. Today, Detroit is full of abandoned buildings and it’s perhaps not surprising when you consider that, since the heyday of the city since the 1950s, the population has declined by more than half. But this decay is becoming an unlikely tourist attraction. Oh my goodness, look at this! jesse Welter is a local photographer. He is taking a group of us to see sights that you may not find in the guide books. Abandoned buildings, you know, schools, churches, warehouses - you name it, it’s all here and there’s a lot of it. We’re in southwestern high school - lot of it. We’re in southwestern high school- once 1,600 students roamed these halls. Many of them probably had parents working in the car factories that Detroit was famous for. It’sjust car factories that Detroit was famous for. It’s just one of over 100 schools that the city has closed since 2005. There’s still enough here to give a really strong sense of what this place would have been like. You can completely imagine these bleachers full of cheering students and people playing basketball. Yet the extraordinary sight. This is our last stop, St there’s a convent. This is St Agnes church in the Virginia Park district. Such an extraordinary building, and yet it’s on a list for demolition and who knows how long it will be here? It’s a breathtaking sight but it’s hard to forget that Detroit’s troubles, brought about by the motor trade, have had a very really impact on the people who live here. Some people say that there could be a level of exploitation in artists coming here and taking advantage of these very striking sites and that it is not really helping anything. What’s your view on that? You know, I didn’t do this. I’m just showing you what it looks like. There has been decay. There’s lots of artistic value in stuff like this. Seeing these buildings going to ruin, it’s very easy to assume that Detroit has become a ghost town. But the blight has actually provided some with opportunities. Before I leave Detroit, I’m on my way to see a man who’s created something quite remarkable out of his corner of Motor City. This was the first e are a that grabbed the attention of the general public. This is Darble, he is an artist who has created a huge outdoor installation in the heart of the city. When the city was barren, so-called blight, those were my happy days, because where did I get all these materials from? I saw it as a great opportunity to use stuff to build stuff. As well as murals and sculptures he has even transformed some of the abandoned buildings themselves, and he doesn’t recognise the doom and gloom stories about his city. I can see that there’s a great spirit of energy, a mental attitude, that people have now that was not there a year ago. The changing car industry has clearly had a huge impact on the city of Detroit and the people who live here. There are those who claim that US car culture itself is on the wane, as people seek out greener WaI’Iâ, as people seek out QFEEFIEF wane, as people seek out greener options like cycling and public transport. But it seems to me that perhaps it’s not dying - perhaps it’sjust perhaps it’s not dying - perhaps it’s just evolving. The perhaps it’s not dying - perhaps it’sjust evolving. The last it’s just evolving. The last stop on mY it’s just evolving. The last stop on myjourney is Pittsburgh, my journey is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. myjourney is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I’m here to get a glimpse of America’s motoring future. This might look like a fairly ordinary car, but believe it or not, this is the future of auto-motive technology. Look closer and you will see the car is covered in hidden sensors and cameras. There is also a not-so-hidden emergency stop button. That’s all because this car can drive itself. OK, so at the moment there’s a man behind the wheel- this isjared snide snide from car neglecty melon university. At the moment I’m driving, it is like a normal car, but if you flip this switch you can go into autonomous mode. You can feel it slow down a little - I think I was speeding! OK! This is really weird! The car is now entirely on autopilot. jared isn’t touching any of the controls. So we’re making a left turn here. That is bizarre to watch the steering wheeljust moving by itself! You can be more productive. You can e-mail, read, maybe take a nap or something like that, on your commute to work. But, more than that, I think some people, as they get older, they might lose the ability to drive. It’s a very strange experience, watching the wheel doing the adjustments, turning corners, putting on indicators. But in some ways it really feels like a normal person is driving and because the car looks like an ordinary car, it somehow feels like this technology isn’t that far out of reach. It could be a few decades before you get one of these as your holiday rental car, but one thing is certain - America’s love affair with the car is not over. And it’s exciting to think how the country will adapt as its favourite mode of transport continues to evolve. I’ve reached the end of myjourney, and at every turn I’ve seen the huge impact that this seemingly simple machine has had on America. In many ways, the story of the automobile is the story of the US. It has played a central role in shaping the country that we know today. Cars have become icons of popular culture and a pasttime in their own right. They’ve even contributed to the rise and fall of one of its greatest cities. But the story is not over - the car will continue to shape America’s future, even by coming here and hitting the open road. Hello there.

The girls, aged 15 and 16, are known to have caught a flight to Turkey on Tuesday. jane-Frances Kelly reports. The three teenage girls can be seen here on CCTV at Gatwick Airport on Tuesday morning as they prepare to leave Britain. This girl is only 15 and police believe she is trying to join Islamic State in Syria with her 16-year-old friend. Both are British. Their third friend is 15 and all three go to this school. They are described as straight a students. They were at home for half term when they told their parents they were going out for the day. Several hours later they were flying to Istanbul. It is the same route to Syria that a fourth friend took in December. It is thought the girls are following in the footsteps of more than 50 British women who have joined Islamic State and there are fears groomers are targeting them because they are vulnerable. Women are at the front of trying to recruit young girls but also men, older men were -- who are befriending them on social media and encouraging them.

British number two, Andy Vernon, seen here on the left, had sarcastically tweeted - ""another stellar field against Mo Farah."" It escalated and Farah fired back, ""that’s why they didn’t put you in the race, mate, because you’re an embarrassment."" Their spat dominated the build-up, but Vernon wasn’t here. As it was the double Olympic Champion streaked to victory. Mo Farah breaks the world record. His time of 8 minutes 3.4 seconds shaved almost a second off the world record. Unbelievable. So many people ask me - when are you going to break the world record. I knew training was going well. I wanted to do. Earlier, fellow Olympic Champion Greg Rutherford won the long jump with an indoor personal best. Katarina johnston Thompson sat a national record of 6 meters 93. The competition belonged to Farah who today let his feet do the talking That’s all for now. I’ll be back with the next news here on BBC One at 10.05pm. Now, it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Welcome to BBC London News, I’m Sonja jessup. The mother of the murdered teenagerjimmy Mizen says she’s been left ""heartbroken"" by a spate of teenage stabbings since the start of this year. Margaret Mizen was attending an event at Millwall Football Club today in tribute to jimmy. The 16-year-old was killed in an unprovoked attack in south-east London in 2008. Tarah Welsh has this report. This wasn’t a typical Saturday at the Den it wasjimmy Day. His face was on the programmes, his name on shirts. The memory of him still in the stands. Whenjimmy used to come, he would sit-in the stand over here, towards the back. You say that the club saved your son, Harry? It helped him afterjimmy was killed. His friends rallied around him, brought him to games. I think it did helpjimmiy was murdered him. The day after his 16th birthday seven years ago. His family set up a foundation to change attitudes. When you see the young people we visit in schools, the wonderful faces, you see the young people we visit in schools, the wonderfulfaces, we know the work we are doing is worthwhile and we shouldn’t give up on our young people. They are working with the football club to spread the message. Millwall have been supportive in this. Many more football clubs should get behind some of the initial nifs their areas, led by tragic circumstantial such as ours. Fans have donated to the cause, many feel it’s important players play their part too. Players are role models, especially in this day and age. The amount of money in the game, it’s important that you put football and society together and with the foundation and the work Millwall are doing, the two go hand in This yearfourteen Millwall are doing, the two go hand in This year fourteen hand. Agers have been stabbed in London. When you hear of another child losing their life, whether they are 11+, 15, 18, 20, they are someone’s child. My heart breaks. We musn’t give up. It’s not a particularly good year. There is a lot of knife crime. Let’s not give up. Let ark’s work in our communities to make things better. Thank you so much for coming out. No goals from Fulham or the home side this afternoon, but this was one day that was about more than football. Police say a large fire that destroyed a storage warehouse in south-east London last night is being treated as suspicious. Up to 100 firefighters tackled the blaze at industrial units off Yarnton Way in Erith for more than three hours. Local residents reported hearing loud explosions. After the huge success of The Great British Bake Off, a new BBC show is hoping to inspire amateur artists to get creative. Among the contestants competing in The Big Painting Challenge is a 20-year-old student from Chelmsford. Emilia Papadopoulos has more. Inspiring us all to pick up a paintbrush. The BBC’s Big Painting Challenge pits amateur artists against each other. One of the show’s contestants is 20-year-old Claire Parker from Chelmsford, who beat thousands of others to make it onto the show. Each week, Claire and her nine competitors were asked to prove their artistic skills with everything from landscapes and cityscapes to portraits and still life. Daphne, in her criticism previously, said that you had style, but you lacked structure? Yeah, now I’m lacking both. Today, Claire is a little less self-critical of his efforts. I really believe in, sort of, the power of painting to do brilliant things and to make people feel important things. That’s a thought echoed by amateur artists at this beginners class in London. I used to like enjoy drawing at school and painting and doing like crafts and even write a bit of poetry and that. So, I thought I’d start with this and see what I get on to. The Art academy runs classes several times a week. Art teacher, Kat, says more beginners are joining in than ever before. Here at The Art Academy, our evening classes, the numbers are increasing, almost like tripling, over the last couple of years. For Claire and the other competitors taking part in The Big Painting Challenge, the best is yet to come. For one will be crowned Britain’s Best Amateur Artist of 2015 with their work gracing one of the most prestigious galleries in the world, the Tate Britain. Now thatjust might be a reason to watch paint dry. You can see how Claire gets on in The Big Painting Challenge, that’s tomorrow night at 6.00pm, here on BBC One. The weather, it’ll be a cold night, cloudy at times, and when it is clear we’re likely to have some frost too. We could also see a bit of mist and fog around. Temperatures falling to minus one Celsius. That’s it from us. Katharine Carpenter will be here tomorrowjust before 6.00pm. There’s plenty more news, travel and weather on our website at the usual address bbc.co.uk/london or on our radio station BBC London 94.9. Until then, have a lovely evening. Bye bye. Tomorrow a lot of us will stay indoors. The picture behind me says it all. Gloomy skies, rain on the way, strong winds and even some snow, particularly across the hills. We will look at that in a second. This is what it looks like in the satellite picture. We are in this window of quieter weather. As far as the here and now is concerned and over night it is quiet. Temperatures will dip away to below freezing. We are talking about two degrees in city centres. In rural spots down to around minus two are owe three degrees. First thing tomorrow morning it will be frosty, there will be sunshine around, particularly in the east. From the west the weather goes down hill. This weather front splashes its way through, sleet and snow. The snow across the hills of Scotland, northern England Wales too, perhaps a bit in Northern Ireland as well. For most of us it will be rain and sleet at the very most. Then eventually in the evening the rain will reach other parts of the country. Not a complete write off tomorrow, depending where you are. Any low pressure with us on Monday, you can see the winds racing around the area of low pressure. It will be a day of sunshine and blustery showers.

137,BBC1 London,21-feb-2015,BBC Weekend News,22:05,20 mins,True,"Why don’t I print them off and leave them on your desk anyway? The families of the schoolgirls, believed to be on their way to meet extremists in Syria, plead for them to come home. Relatives of Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana urge their daughters to return - tonight, Amira Abase is named as the third member of the group. Today the Prime Minster said every community had a role to play in preventing people from having their mind poisoned. Also tonight: On camera for the first time - the controversial comments that led to the sacking of a UKIP councillor. Tackling dementia - the Government pledges to make Britain a world leader in research and medical trials. COMMENTATORZ COMMENTATOR: Mo Farah breaks the world record! And, what a way for Mo Farah to start the new Athletics season. Good evening. The families of the three London schoolgirls, who are believed to be on their way to Syria to meet extremists from so-called Islamic State, have pleaded for them to return home. Each family issued a statement, as tonight the third girl was named as Amira Abase. Earlier David Cameron said every university, school and community had a role to play in preventing people’s minds ""being poisoned by an appalling death cult."" Our Home Affairs Correspondent, Daniel Sandford, reports. Four days after the three school friends went missing, these are still the last images of them, going through security at Gatwick Airport, just before 11am Tuesday morning, on their way to Istanbul and thought to be heading for Syria. This evening, the family of 15-year-old Shamima Begum appealed to her through the media. ""We miss you terribly and are extremely worried about you. Please, if you hear this message, get in touch and let us know you’re safe. Syria’s a dangerous place and we don’t want you to go there."" Kadiza Sultana’s family wrote, ""We all love you dearly. The last four days have been a complete nightmare not knowing where you are. We just want to you return home safe and sound."" The third girl is 15-year-old Amira Abase, whose family tonight agreed, for the first time, for her picture to be published, as they appealed for her to return as soon as possible. It is deeply concerning, obviously our authorities will do everything we can to help these girls, but it does make a broader point, which is the fight against Islamist extremist terror is not just one we can wage by the police and borer control. This town on the Turkey-Syria border is one possible crossing point. Because of bad weather this week hindering travel, the girls could still be in Turkey and could still be persuaded to return. Bethnal Green academy, where the girls were in the same year, resumed school on Monday, after the half-term break, and three of its star, GCSE pupils will be missing, presumed to be on their way tojoin the Islamic State. Shamima Begum’s Twitter account hasjust the Islamic State. Shamima Begum’s Twitter account has just one Twitter account hasjust one post, in which this week she messaged a Scottish woman who travelled to Syria in 2013 and has been trying to persuade other British women to follow. Her parents’ lawyer spoke on their behalf tonight. Clearly, the family are full of or or. -- their behalf tonight. Clearly, the family are full of or or. -- horror. They’re full of anger, the acts of their daughter may well have been involved in trying to recruit one of these young women. There’s no sign that the three teenagers are even aware of the concerns they’ve left in their wake and certainly, none of them has yet called home. Daniel is here with me. That is the crucial question for the families certainly, what are the prospects of actually getting them home? I think there is still a chance. That’s because the combination of the atrocious weather conditions in Turkey, which is making the travel by road to the border very difficult and the fact that the BBC team in Turkey can’t find any evidence that the three girls took a flight, internalflight, in Turkey the three girls took a flight, internal flight, in Turkey and our contacts on the border say very few people have crossed into Islamic State-controlled territory in Syria, if any this week. There’s quite a good chance that the girls are still in Turkey. The question is whether they will see these appeals from their parents or whether anyone else in seeing them will connect three anonymous young teenagers with the huge storm that’s going on here back in Britain. They may still be in Turkey and there is still a chance that they can be caught before they cross the border, but I fear that the chance is quite slim. Daniel, thank you. The UKIP Leader, Nigel Farage, has condemned what he’s described as ""deeply racist"" comments that led to the expulsion of a party member. The remarks were made by a councillor in Kent during filming for a BBC documentary in December, but it’s only now that the full extent of her comments have been revealed. You may find some of the language in Alex Forsyth’s report offensive. The seat on the Kent coastline that Nigel Farage hopes to win for Ukip at the election in May, now once again in the political spotlight. I was a memberfor the again in the political spotlight. I was a member for the Conservative Party for 22 years... A BBC documentary team spent the end of last year with local Ukip supporters including rose Ann Duncan, then a Ukip Councillor. She made comments in front of cameras that can be broadcast for the first time ahead of the documentary’s airing tomorrow. Despite declaring she wasn’t a racist she said... The only people I do have problems with are negroes. I don’t know why. I don’t know whether there’s something in any psyche or whether, it’s karma from a previous life, but I have - any psyche or whether, it’s karma from a previous life, but I have - I really do have a problem. , with people with negro features. A friend said, what would you do if I invited you to dinner and I put you next to someone? I wouldn’t be there. Simple as that. I wouldn’t be there. Miss Duncan’s colleague cheer shocked challenged her view, Duncan’s colleague cheer shocked challenged herview, but challenged her view, but admitting she really did have a problem for which she needed help, she went on. I was born in the late 1+os, early 50s, when, especially down in Thanet, there weren’t any, you know and I wasn’t brought up with it. That’s no justification at all. It doesn’t answer the question why is she like that with them and not anybody else, really bizarre. Ukip HQ was told about the comments at the time and expelled Miss Duncan from the party immediately. This week Nigel Farage said her views weren’t shared. What was said was wholly inappropriate, at odds with what Ukip stands for. We just don’t tolerate that sort of thing. Miss Dunkan declined an interview before seeing the documentary. In a letter to her party, she said her comments weren’t racist or derogatory. She said she was treated unfairly by Ukip and said in no way was it her intention to cause offence. You’ve kip has been caught up in claims of racism before. This time it’s in Thanet where they need support for the general election. Will this dent their popularity or will their supporters see this focus on one woman’s comments as an attempt to discredit the party’s popularity. The BBC said the documentary was made with Ukip’s agreement. The fast growing party has had to cope with renewed scrutiny and sometimes unwelcome focus. And you can see the full documentary tomorrow evening. That’s ""Meet the Ukippers"" - BBC Two at 10pm. An International Institute for Dementia is to be set up in England in the next five years - in an attempt to make Britain a world leader for research and medical trials. The Government has also announced additional training for NHS staff in how to care for people living with dementia. Our Health Editor, Hugh Pym, reports. The Prime Minister meeting Pam Taylor who has got dementia and her daughter, on the day that Hiro leased an initiative to put ~ -- he unveiled initiatives as part of a drive to put Britain ahead of the global battle against dementia. He also met dementia friends, volunteers trained to become more aware of the symptoms. The scheme launched two years ago, now has one million members. As Mr Cameron told me, there are plans to boost research, including a new global fund. In Britain, we’ve got almost a million people with dementia. That’s going to double tragically by 2030. Worldwide this is a global health issue. Underyour Worldwide this is a global health issue. Under your Government, social care issue. Underyour Government, social care funding has been cut. Hasn’t that been of no help to dementia patients and careers? What we’ve done is protect NHS spending. That has gone up every year. We’ve used i’13S QOTIE up âVâI’y YEBI’. We’ve used SOTTIE has gone up every year. We’ve used some of the health budget to fund social care. We need to bring health and social care closer together. As charities involved in dementia care and research welcomed the announcement, Labourargued and research welcomed the announcement, Labour argued that more needed to be done to make the system work better. It’s welcome as far as it goes, but it’s not equal to the challenge that’s coming at us. We need a bigger solution. That’s why Labour’s proposing a national health and care service, getting rid of those 15-minute visits in people’s homes and really giving people the support, the proper support that they need. Grace knows all about the benefits of having dementia friends. She appreciates the visits and the help they offer. I am only too grateful that they do. I’m annoyed with myself that they’ve got to, it’s that sort of feeling. I think, I shouldn’t have to be like. This I should be helping other people not them helping me. I’m really very conscious of that, to be honest. But on the other hand, I’m most appreciative of it as well. I won’t deny that. Dementia has a higher profile, but there’s still some way to go in the search for a cure or effective treatment of a condition, which is distressing for both patients and careers. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has said his country has ""won a battle, but not the war"" in the negotiations about the future of its international bail out. In the deal struck last night, Greece has to submit a list of financial reforms to its creditors by Monday, in order to secure a four-month extension to its rescue package. From Athens, Mark Lowen reports. After the deal in Brussels, the hard sell in Athens. Greece is digesting a compromise which pulled it back from the edge, its hand forced by the fact its banks could sink. It took three meetings for the deal to be struck. Greece will get a four-month extension of its loan and it won’t make any move without EU agreement, so raising the minimum wage is probably off the table and it will be supervised by its creditors which it had fought against. The government is pushing its message that Greece now has a say in what measures it will accept and may be allowed to spend a little to help the poorest. The Prime Minister called it a decisive step, leaving austerity and the old bail out behind. Choosing policies of growth. His party gave a different message before the election to what it has had to accept. The party was elected promising to exit the bail out and reverse austerity and it is then forced into a major climb-down. The hard left of the party may rebel but it just gained the backing of centrists instead. They believe the party has taken a pragmatic path to avoid the threat of Greece crashing out of the euro. In the leftist heartland, they are reserving judgment on the deal served up. They are doing a step back of what they promised to the people. I cannot say it is a victory but I cannot say it is a failure. We took for the moment some time. Saved at the 11th hour, but the prospects are still shrouded in doubt and it could be back here again in four months time. With all the sport, here’sjohn Watson at the BBC Sport Centre. Good evening. Mo Farah has set a new two-mile indoor world record in his first race of the year. But the build up to his superb run in Birmingham, was overshadowed by a public row with a fellow British athlete, as David Ornstein reports. The poster boy of British athletics back on the track. Mo Farah starting his season with an eye on the two-mile world record. But what of the competition? British number two Andy Vernon, on the left here, had sarcastically tweeted, ""Another stellar field against Mo Farah."" It escalated and Mo Farah fired back, ""That’s why they didn’t put you in the race, mate, because you’re an embarrassment."" Vernon wasn’t here and as it was, the double Olympic champion streaked to victory. COMMENTATOR: Mo Farah breaks the world record! His time of 8. 03. 04 shaved almost a second off the previous best. Unbelievable. People were asking me when I was going to break the world record. I wanted to do it. Gregg Rutherford won the long iump do it. Gregg Rutherford won the long jump with an indeer personal best. Katrina Tomsonjohnson jump with an indeer personal best. Katrina Tomson johnson set a national record of 6. 93. The competition belonged to Farah, who today let his feet do the talking. Match of the Day follows the news here on BBC One, so if you don’t want to know the key results from today’s Premier League matches, then look away now. A 5-0 win over Newcastle United helped Manchester City trim Chelsea’s lead at the top of the table to five points. £28 million pound signing Wilfiried Bony made his debut for City, coming on as a second-half substitute. Chelsea could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Burnley, the visitors equalising late on, after Blues midfielder Nemanja Matic was sent off. Manager Tim Sherwood lost his first match since taking charge of Aston Villa. And Manchester United striker Robin Van Persie left the Liberty Stadium on crutches, as Manchester United were beaten 2-1 by Swansea City. In Rugby Union Northampton have moved nine points clear at the top of the Premiership, after a fightback saw them beat second placed Bath. Tries from james Wilson and this from hooker Mike Haywood cancelled out the home side’s early lead, winning 21-13. Elsewhere, Gloucester condemned London Welsh to another defeat 48-10. 27 points from Henry Slade ensured Exeter beat Harlequins, while Sale Sharks upset Saracens 14-10. In the Pro12, Glasgow remain top of the table, after a late penalty gave them a 19-16 win at home to Ospreys. And Scarlets had to settle for a draw, as a stoppage-time jj Hanarahan try helped Munster to level things 25-25. That is all the sport. Can you see CEI’! yOU SEE ITIOFE OI’! Can you see more on today’s stories on the BBC News channel and of course, a first look at tomorrow’s papers. That is all from me for tonight. Good night. Hello. A cold and frosty night on the way tonight, but tomorrow, from the morning onwards, the weather turns, particularly across western parts of the country. Wet and windy weather on the way. On top of that, even hill snow, particularly across Scotland and the Pennines as well. This is what the satellite picture shows. The cloud is streaming off the Atlantic. For the moment, we’re in this slot of calm weather. The winds are light. The skies are clear. The temperatures are dipping away. In town centres, I suspect peoplures will be around freezing, maybe a couple of degrees above. In rural spots it will be colder than that, possibly to minus two or minus three degrees Celsius. Let’s look at the forecast as we head from tomorrow morning onwards. For some of us, it will be a clear and cold start. Then very quickly, rain sweeps through Northern Ireland, even snow, for a time. The snow across Scotland could actually be quite heavy in the north-east. We could see a covering of five to ten centimetres. Further south, more likely to be just rain and sleet at the very most. Then winds will also blow in the cloud an the rain to the far south-east of the country. By Monday, this low pressure will be swinging some very strong winds in our direction. So it could be quite disruptive and possibly even stormy in some parts of north-western Britain. On top of that, we have the cold wind blowing, making it feel pretty cold, lots of showers, hail and sleet.

141,BBC1 London,28-feb-2015,BBC London News,19:05,10 mins,True,"budgets have very big advertising budgets are encouraging consumers only to switch to tariffs where those sites can earn a good commission. Price comparison websites like these usually get paid a commission of up to £60 per switch, from the energy company that a customer moves to. MPs now say it should be far clearer which firms are paying commissions and compensation should be paid to those who were not offered the cheapest rates on the market. Trevor Sampson in Gloucestershire was wrongly told by one price comparison company that an energy tariff was the cheapest, only to discover days later that it was not. That whole process is a racket, and the comparison sites are making lots of commission out of it. And the energy suppliers are punishing loyal customers if they stay with them. But the price comparison companies argue publishing how much commission they earn might baffle rather than help consumers. If we are so transparent we overload people with information, often it will drop out of the whole process and get confused. So there is a balance to be struck. The competition and market authority is also investigating price comparison website as part of its wider energy market probe. In the meantime consumers are advised to be more cautious when shopping around. Prince William - who’s visiting japan - has travelled to Fukushima to meet some of the people affected by the earthquake and tsunami four years ago, which killed nearly 19-thousand people. Earlier he visited the set of a japanese TV show and donned the costume of a samurai warlord. Our royal correspondent, Peter Hunt, is travelling with the prince. There is flash photography from the start of his report. The prince, who will one day wear a crown, but is no longer required to wear a wig, is here at the studios ofjapan’s public service broadcaster, NHK. With a sibling like Prince Harry, he was happy to watch, but not participate. If I put one of these on, my brother will never let me live it down. Spared brotherly humiliation, it fell to Tim Hitchens, Britain’s ambassador to japan, to serve Queen, country and the prince. He was full of delight from the sidelines. The diplomat who has worked in Afghanistan, Kashmirand Africa, needs to update his CV. Next stop for the wigless prince, the broadcaster’s studio. This is where NHK film a popular drama series set in the 19th century. Having turned down the offer of a full head of hair, Prince William knew there was no escape and the costume department came calling. Fantastic, I feel ready This afternoon a change of scene, an abundance of bodyguards. A new host for the Prince, japan’s Prime Minister. Vince Williams has travelled from Tokyo to this region, Fukushima, to meet those affected by the devastating tsunami in 2007, its damaged a nuclear plant that had to shut down because it was leaking radiation. -- shut down because it was leaking radiation. -- Prince William. A prince at play demonstrating this area’s recovery. Children are no respecters of rank, as he knows from Prince George. That’s it for now - we’re back with the late news at 10.15pm. Now its time for the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. A15 year old-boy cycling with friends near King’s Cross Station has been stabbed to death. It happened on Caledonian Road early yesterday evening - with police tonight stepping up patrols in the area. Sarah Harris reports from the scene. A treasured school photograph of 15-year-old Alan Cartwright. Today his tight-knit family in North London are mourning him. just yesterday evening he was out cycling with his friends. Officers say the group came across three men who attacked them. They were walking in the opposite direction down the Caledonian Road in Islington. A bike covered in flowers, a reminder of Alan’s favourite past time. Theft cannot be ruled out as the police say that two of the teenagers cycles were taken. The 15-year-old managed to like a short distance along Aberdonian road before collapsing, he was pronounced dead at the scene a short time afterwards. Police are appealing for anyone who saw anything here at around 7:30pm yesterday to contact them. Generations of Alan’s family were brought up in this part of north London and neighbours take his smile will be sadly missed. With Alan, his eyes, he has got really big blue eyes, and even if he was mischievous, cheeky, when he looked at you and smiled, that was the thing that melted my heart anyway. He was a good boy, really good. Extra police officers have been deployed in Islington to reassure the community. The three suspects were last seen heading south along the Caledonian Road. Homelessness in London has increased by over a third injust a year. The charity CRISIS says the rise is due to welfare reforms. While the government - who released the figures - says London has many more ‘foreign national’ rough sleepers. Thousands of people across London have been signing petitions, pledging to support the National Health Service. Organised by the campaign group ‘38 Degrees’ - the ""save NHS day"" saw events all over the capital- with people voicing concerns about their local issues. Here’sjim Wheble. Perhaps not the welcome travellers expected at King’s Cross today, but the subject matter was familiar to most. Save the NHS. We want to send a really strong signal to all politicians that the general public, we love the NHS, we want all political parties to do better to protect the NHS. Thank you so much, superb. More signatures this time in Hackney’s Broadway market and more concerned from a local GP. It is the people who keep the NHS, the people who work for it, the workforce, who keep it sitting at the top of the world. Forservices. One of keep it sitting at the top of the world. For services. One of my concerns is that privatisation will damage that culture. Sign up today for the NHS. At Finchley Road over 1000 signatures have been collected by lunchtime, with similar concerns about funding and creeping privatisation. There are over 80 events like this happening all across London, gathering signatures for petitions to be handed to local candidates in the upcoming general election. The message is clear: The public care deeply about the NHS. Something consistently backed up by opinion polls and white all the political parties are keen to stress the future of the NHS is safe with us. -- the future of the NHS is safe with us. -- and white political parties. The choir has been asked to leave the King’s Cross concourse. They have an NHS free for all is not removed as well. -- they hope. An unusual musical partnership has been performing in London. The reason it’s unusual is because the Hapsichord player is Iranian and the Mandolin player is from Israel. Mahan Esfahani and Avi Avital say their love of music transcends their nations’ differences - and by playing side-by-side in Marylebone in central London - they feel they’re practicing the reality, of the type of world they want to live in. The dream, the dream of all of us is that in the future and Ukrainian and an Israeli playing together, Israeli and Palestinian, we’ll be as normal as French with Norwegian. Good for them. A look at tomorrow’s weather. Some showers early in the morning, but when they pass - they’ll leave a brighter day. More showers possible later, Top temperature, 11 celsius. That’s it.

APPLAUSE The murder of a prominent Russian opposition politician sparks international condemnation. Boris Nemtsov - a vocal critic of President Putin - was shot dead near the Kremlin. The Russian government denies any involvement and calls his killing a vile and cynical crime. jihadi john - the Home Secretary defends the way the security services handled his case. Police investigating the disappearance of 16-year-old girl Becky Watts arrest two people. Wales hold their nerve in Paris to beat France and keep their Six Nations title hopes alive. Good evening. The Russian government has denied allegations that it was involved in the murder of Boris Nemtsov - a prominent opponent of President Putin. He was shot dead near the Kremlin last night - just hours after appealing for support for a march against the war in Ukraine. Here, David Cameron hasjoined in international condemnation of the murder. The Prime Minister said he was shocked and sickened. Our correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. They’ve been coming here all day, friends and supporters of Boris Nemtsov, laying tributes at the spot where the politician was murdered. Stunned, struggling to absorb what’s happened here. TRANSLATION: We are in shock. We were crying all night. It’s just impossible to believe. He was the most honest and open politician in our country. Boris Nemtsov rose to prominence under Russia’s first President, Boris Yeltsin. He was a well- known liberal reformer. But he had been pushed to the political margins in recent years, like all opposition here. He became a fierce critic of President Putin, most recently blaming him directly for the war in Ukraine. just hours before his death, Mr Nemtsov was in typical biting style on Russian radio. TRANSLATION: Of course we need political reform in the country. When power is concentrated in the hands of one person, and this person always rules, everything ends up in absolute catastrophe. This is a killing that sent shockwaves through Russia’s political opposition. Boris Nemtsov, one of their best known leaders, shot dead right here just metres from the Kremlin. It’s a murder that’s raised huge questions about who might have wanted him dead, why here, and why now? President Putin has called the killing on his doorstep vile and cynical. His spokesman has denied the Kremlin is in any way involved. Instead, investigators suspect a provocation, an attempt to destabilise Russia. But at the headquarters of Boris Nemtsov’s political party his allies say Mr Putin’s own policies are fanning the flames of nationalism to dangerous heights. Maybe radicalfrom those movements, they executed this, we don’t know. We don’t know, but the whole environment created by the government absolutely, that’s the reason why it could potentially happen. Tonight, as the mountain of flowers grew, police were still hunting for the gunman. Boris Nemtsov had been planning an opposition rally tomorrow. Instead, his friends are now preparing a march to mourn his death. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has defended the security services - amidst criticism of the way they handled the Islamic State extremist Mohammed Emwazi - the man known as jihadi john. Former Conservative Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, has described MI5’s tactics in the case as ineffective. Here’s our political correspondent, Chris Mason. The un masking this week ofjihad john as Mohammed Emwazi, a graduate from London and the news that he was well- known to MI5 has led to questions for the security services. The senior Conservative David Davis said the fact MI5 knew about him but failed to stop him travelling abroad was part of a worrying pattern. MrDavis pointed out that one of the London bombers in 2005 was also known to the security services as was one of the men who beheaded the soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in London in 2013. Mohammed Emwazi was a student here at the University of West Minister as we found out more about him in the last few days, it’s a reminder of the scale of the challenge the security services face, it’s also restarted the debate about whether they have the powers they need. Speaking to Conservative activists in Cardiff, the Home Secretary was unflinching in her support for the security services. You might not see the work they do, you might not know about the risks they take, you might not be told about the plots they’ve stopped and the lives they’ve saved, but these remarkable men and women are true heros and they deserve the support and respect of every single one of us. Tonight, the Department for Education confirmed it will examine if any lessons can be learned from the schools like the academy in north London where Mohammed Emwazi was educated. The London boy who grew up to be a terrorist isjust the latest extremist to disown his country and leave it with big questions about how to protect itself. Two people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a Bristol teenager. Sixteen-year-old Becky Watts was last seen over a week ago and today more than a 100 friends and family spent the day searching the area near where she disappeared. From there, jon Kay sent this report. Described by her friends as quiet and shy, 16-year-old Becky Watts missing now for nine days. Forensic Forensic teams have once again been searching her family home in the St George area of Bristol. Becky’s said to have left here a week ago on Thursday with just a laptop, phone and a tablet device. Following today’s arrests, Becky’s father and stepmother said in a statement they were now preparing for the worst. Earlier this week, they told me they were desperate for news. If you have got her, then put her somewhere we can find her. We want her home, please! Police have spent all week searching for Becky and tonight they’re giving no further details about the two people arrested this afternoon. Officers say their efforts to locate the schoolgirl go on. Hundreds of local people have joined that effort, scouring parks and woodland looking for clues. People can’t just vanish. Someone’s got to know something and I urge anyone who has any information that they think may be relevant, no matter how small they may think it is, that might be the break we need. This isjust one of several locations that Becky’s friends and family are searching today and they say they’re determined to keep up this kind of presence and effort for as long as it takes. As they question two people tonight, police have renewed their appeal for anyone with information to come forward and Becky’s father has said he still hopes she’ll be found unharmed. Tributes have been paid to a 15-year-old boy who was stabbed to death as he cycled with friends in Islington in North London. Alan Cartwright managed to continue cycling a short distance after being attacked by three men last night. He then collapsed and died at the scene. A fragile truce in Eastern Ukraine appears to be holding tonight despite the killing of three government soldiers and a Ukranian journalist since Friday morning. The port city of Mariupol is still preparing for a possible new offensive by pro-Russian rebels. There much of the front line fighting is being done by volunteers from a militia called the Azov Battalion. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes has been taken to see them training and sent this report. just then, this young soldier very nearly lost his toe. Soon they may be doing this for year. This is a far right militia formed to fight the rebels in eastern Ukraine. If the rebels a tack Mariupol these men will be vital. These men are all volunteers and ultimately that means they’re more willing to fight and to die for the cause of Ukrainian nationalism. A year ago, this man was a computer engineer. Now he is a veteran of several battles. Why is it important to fight? When we fight, we show that we are stronger. If we don’t show our enemies we are a strong country, the enemies, they can make of us anything they want. Are you prepared to die? In battle, then go to Valhalla. Until two weeks ago, they were neighbours in a village down the coast, but then the rebels came. TRANSLATION: I was always sure that Russia would invade. Right after we got independence in ‘91, the Russians put a tank brigade on the border near here. If you stockpile weapons, you intend to use them. In 21st-century Europe, this is not supposed to happen. Borders are not supposed to be redrawn by force. It is shocking to realise they still can be, and to see what happens to those caught in the way. Prince William, who’s on a tour ofjapan, has visited the Fukushima area - which was devastated by a tsunami four years ago. He gave an impromptu demonstration of hisjuggling skills at a children’s centre. The toddlers there have only recently been allowed to play outside because of the health risks following the nuclear meltdown caused by the tsunami. Now let’s catch up on all the sports news. Good evening. The Six Nations continues this weekend and Scotland have suffered their third successive defeat- this time at the hands of Italy who beat them 22-19 at Murrayfield with a last-minute penalty try. There was better news for Wales in Paris who kept alive their title hopes beating France 20-13. Patrick Gearey watched the action. The Welsh national anthem, a cappella. The Stade de France strips away any unnecessary accompaniment. Playing here is a test of nerve. Leigh Halfpenny is as good as anyone within sight of the posts, his kicks taking Wales into a narrow lead. France sent on Uini Atonio, their heaviest ever Six Nations player, part of a plan to batter the Welsh wall down. Wales stood firm and wriggled from his grasp. Eventually the French forwards created enough space for their backs to work with. Even then, Brice Dulin had to time his dive perfectly. But France had left their attack too late. A fourth straight win for Wales. Not even their great side of the ‘70s managed that. A win of any description would have done for Scotland, whojust needed a break. It was four points going into the final minute. Scotland strained every sinew to stop Italy. In the end they could only do so illegally. That whistle meant a penalty try and a demoralising defeat. There were six games in the Premier League today. Match of the Day will have the highlights after the news. Here are the results: The biggest scoreline came from the championship where Hearts demolished Cowdenbeath 10-0. And she gave it her absolute best but cyclist Dame Sarah Storey couldn’t add the World Hour record to her illustrious list of achievments. Britain’s most sucessful Paralympian wasjust over half a kilometre short of the A6 needed but she did break the British and Paralympic record.

Good evening. It may be a bit of an exaggeration to say March is coming in like a lion but the weather will definitely have teeth over the next few days. A cold and gusty wind and wiptry -- wintry showers. Tonight the main problem is the strength of the wind, very gusty at the moment across Northern Ireland and strong winds through central and southern Scotland. Possibly 70mph gusts. Those potentially damaging gusts will have eased by the morning but it’s still a blustery day with showers across northern Britain turning to sleet and snow. Further south generally a sunny start but this feature will bring rain and winds across Wales and that may have ",,
144,BBC1 London,7-feb-2015,BBC Weekend News,12:00,10 mins,True,"Good afternoon. There has been more fighting in eastern Ukraine, with reports that civilians and pro-government soldiers have been killed. It came as the German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the latest diplomatic initiative to end the conflict may not succeed. But she said her peace mission to Moscow yesterday, with the French President, was worth making. Our diplomatic correspondent, Emily Buchanan, reports. The frantic diplomatic push to find peace for Ukraine enters another crucial day. European alarm at suggestions the Americans might start has given talks in Munich greater urgency. The blueprint for a new peace plan appears to be the resurrection of an old one. TRANSLATION: This crisis cannot be solved by military means which is why it is more important than ever to define substantial steps that fill the agreement with life. This is the purpose which all our talks served in Kiev and Moscow. That agreement from last September envisaged a cease-fire and the freezing of troop positions. Russian backed forces have taken the battle lines further into Ukraine. So, if Minsk has safe clearly felled, can be revived? TRANSLATION: I say it is uncertain whether the talks will be crowned a success but, in my view and in that of the French president, it was worth our while to make this attempt. We owe it not least to the people affected in the Ukraine. Angella Merkel and the French president had rushed to Moscow on Friday for talks with President Putin. Eagerto Friday for talks with President Putin. Eager to avert an escalation of the conflict. Nato is sending signals Ukraine needs Western help to match the Russian military involvement. If we bring more intense diplomatic pressure, more intense economic pI’âSSUI’â, ITIOFE iI’ItâI’ISâ âCOI’IOITIiC pI’âSSUI’â, pressure, more intense economic pressure, all of those could tip of a further acceleration by the Russians and certainly if we do consider any military assistance, that we will have to consider as well. There was some optimism from the Russian Foreign Minister who said he believed there would be a result, to allow the sides to really untie this is a conflict. And it needs to untied soon. For civilians, life is getting desperate, people are struggling as food, water and medicines are running out. As yet, no one knows what the peace plan will be and whether the forces on the ground will abide by it. The NHS in England has been criticised for the way it investigates allegations of avoidable deaths. A review by Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman found that 40% of internal investigations were inadequate. Our health correspondent, jane Dreaper, reports. When hospital care goes wrong, and medical mistakes might have caused harm, patients and their families deserve a thorough investigation. That is the message from the ombudsman. Her office has found that too many NHS trusts are failing to carry out basic inquiries into complaints. They reviewed 150 cases alleging avoidable harm to patients or even death. In 40% of the cases, the NHS investigation was inadequate. In one case, a hospital admitted there were mistakes made in a baby’s delivery, only after her parents had paid £250 for an independent review. The ombudsman Dame julie Mellor is due to give evidence next week to a parliamentary committee which is looking at the NHS complaints system. Her office was itself recently accused of failing patients. It is not acceptable, it is unforgivable in a sense that, when people are alleging there has been avoidable harm, and sometimes even when it is very clear that the harm is such that it should be recorded as a serious incident and warrant an investigation, either the investigations aren’t happening, or even where they are flawed, and therefore the lessons cannot be learned. The Government says it has placed a legal obligation on hospitals in England to apologise for mistakes, and made complaints handling a crucial part of the inspection regime. At least 20 people have been killed in two separate bomb attacks in Baghdad, on the day the government is to due to lift a long-standing curfew. The first explosion hit a Shi’ite neighbourhood in the New Baghdad area, while the other targeted a popular market near the city centre. The parents of the US aid worker, Kayla jean Mueller, held captive by Islamic State militants, have said they’re hopeful she’s still alive. IS said she died in a jordanian air attack. But Amman has dismissed that as ""criminal propaganda"". The Labour leader Ed Miliband has said a Labour government would push for UK overseas territories to be put on an international blacklist if they refuse to co-operate with a drive against tax avoidance. Speaking in Nottingham, he said the affairs of tax havens are still ""shrouded in darkness"". Today I am serving notice on those tax havens. They will have six months from the day the next Labour government takes office. Six months to open up their books and put their house in order. If they do not do so, they will be put on a blacklist and face sanctions. joining us from Westminster is our political correspondent, Eleanor Garnier. What has he been saying? Those territories he is referring to, jersey, Guernsey and the isle of man. Critics have pointed out the OECD which regulates international tax rules cannot force those territories to adopt a register because they are financially independent. The Conservatives say this shows Ed Miliband does not have a grasp of thejob of looking Miliband does not have a grasp of the job of looking after the economy. This comes on the back of a week where the Labour Party had been criticised for being anti-business. Today, some relief in the form of the former Business Minister Lord Mandelson who defended Ed Miliband saying he was pro-business. Mr Mandelson also admitted he had spoken to Alanjohnson, the man who may have taken over the Labour Bishop role in November when there were rumours Ed Miliband’sjob was on the line. He said he had not encouraged him to go for thejob. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. The next news on BBC One is at 6:55pm. Bye for now. Good afternoon. For the first time for a while, a forecast that does not contain any mention of the word, snow. Our weather is on the snow, high pressure from the Atlantic which will help things become drier. But there is thicker cloud pushing its way into southern areas. Further north, more sunny breaks this afternoon. A bit more cloud toward the north west of Scotland. Lighter winds elsewhere, in the sunshine, feeling pleasant. Sunshine is diverting over northern England and North Wales. A generally cloudy picture in the south with a roar went. That will ease over the next 24 hours. Tonight, some clearer skies. Where the winds are the latest, we could see some dense fog patches. We could see a Frost once again, down to -6.

There has been more fighting in Eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian rebels and government soldiers and more civilian casualties. It came as France’s President Hollande warned that a French/German peace plan was one of the last chances for avoiding a wider war. Leaders have been meeting in Munich to discuss the proposals. Our chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet is there. In the dead of winter, in a dangerous war, thousands are on the run. But in eastern Ukraine the fighting is spreading between Government troops and pro-Russian separatists. And so diplomacy has ratcheted up. Last night, Germany’s Angela Merkel and President Holland flew to Moscow. On the table, a new peace plan presented to President Putin. Today the focus shifted from Moscow to Munich. TRANSLATION: It is uncertain whether they will be crowned a success but in our view it is well worth our while to make an attempt. We owe it not least to the people in Ukraine affected by this crisis. Last September, a ceasefire had been agreed. It fell along this line: But since then the rebel advance cut deeper. Reports about this new plan speak of a demilitaryisation zone. It may lie here around 30-45 miles around current frontlines. But Ukraine’s President rejected changes to the old deal. If we do our best to sign UP old deal. If we do our best to sign up the peace protocol, the ceasefire we should have right to defend our territory. And our people. Ukraine is not just territory. And our people. Ukraine is notjust a war on Europe’s doorstep, it’s also its biggest test. Many are now saying the best that can be achieved is a ceasefire that freezes both sides where they are. If that’s the case, Europe will have failed the test to safeguard Ukraine’s borders. With no agreement in sight, Washington is talking about sending arms to bolster Ukrainian forces. Russia warns against it. TRANSLATION: The conflict cannot be solved by force. There are appeals in the West to solved by force. There are appeals inthe West to support Kiev’s policy of militaryisation, to pump Ukraine full of weapons. This will only make the tragedy worse. The new plan is also said to include greater autonomy for rebel forces but they’re not waiting for any deal, they’ve already taken charge. james Reynolds is in eastern Ukraine, inthe rebel controlled city of Donetsk Evenif Even if there was an agreement would rebel forces abide by it? I think that entirely depends on one simple question, exactly where would a ceasefire line be drawn? If it’s drawn on last September’s lines, the rebels may want to say no because they would have to give up land they’ve taken since then. If it drawn on today’s lines, they may want to say drawn on today’s lines, they may wa nt to say yes want to say yes because they get to keep the land they’ve taken. They built up their own mini state here and they want to hold on to it. But remember one thing, they rely for their support on Russia and their final decision about an agreement may come down to what President Putin in Moscow wants. Here the war has continued for several hours in Donetsk. We have heard explosions in the distance of artillery fire between Ukrainian forces and rebel forces and people, those residents left here on the outskirts of town, are sheltering tonight in basements. Thank you very much. The way the NHS investigates serious complaints, including those where patients have died, has been strongly criticised by the health watchdog in England. The ombudsman says many of the inquiries are inadequate and patients and their families are being let down. Daniel Boettcher has the details. When patients or their families have complaints about the care they’ve received or if mistakes have been made, those concerns are first investigated by NHS Trusts themselves. If they aren’t resolved they can be taken to the health service ombudsman. A review of complaints referred has found serious failings in the way they are handled by some NHS Trusts in England. It’s unforgiveable in a sense that when people are alleging there has been avoidable harm and sometimes even when it’s very clear that the harm is such that it should be recorded as a serious incident and warrantan be recorded as a serious incident and warrant an investigation, that either those investigations aren’t happening or where they are happening they’re flawed, and therefore, the lessons can’t be learned. The report found that there was significant variation in the quality of NHS investigations. It examined 150 cases involving allegations of avoidable harm or death. It found that in 40% of those, the investigations were inadequate. In one case a day-old baby suffered permanent brain damage because of what the report called serious mistakes during a blood transfusion. It said the hospital’s investigation into the case was fundamentally flawed. The ombudsman’s office was itself accused of failing families in a recent report by a charity. Those pushing for a better overall system of investigating complaints say change must happen faster. That’s going to require cultural change as well as changes to processes. So that everybody can see that actually complaints are important, complaints are there to learn from. The Department of Health says hospitals now have a legal duty to apologise to patients when mistakes happen and that it’s made complaints handling a key element of tougher hospital inspections. At least 30 people have been killed in two separate bomb attacks in Iraq’s capital Baghdad. It came on the day the government was due to lift a long-standing curfew there. The first explosion hit a Shi’ite neighbourhood. The second targeted a popular market near the city centre. Ed Miliband has said a Labour Government will clamp down on British tax havens such as Bermuda and jersey, if his party wins the general election. Mr Miliband said they would have six months to open their books or be placed on an international blacklist. The Conservatives said no other western economy had agreed to the proposed tax register and the plan wouldn’t work. Now all the sport.

As an Arsenal fan he won’t have enjoyed what happened this afternoon as Spurs came out in top in the north London derby. Harry Kane kept UP north London derby. Harry Kane kept up his credible form scoring twice for Tottenham. Tottenham have spent recent years under development, building a new ground, constructing a new team. Here theyjudged the strength of the foundations by how they hold up against Arsenal and Spurs neighbours have discovered a ruthless streak of late. From there things would be harder for that corner of north London. This time there was space infront of Rose, not behind. The margins were slim but still in Arsenal’s favour. Tottenham needed a moment of clarity. The solution was home grown, Harry Kane’s finish was cold and detached. The celebration anything but. A Spurs fan equalising for Spurs. The excitement was catching. In the frenzied moments of quality count there were it two here. With five minutes to go derbies can be decided by instinct. Kane seems to live for these moments. His 22nd and most important goal of the season. Complete chaos created by calm. Millions of pounds worth of talent, a man from the youth team. Spurs had a hero on their own doorstep. Elsewhere, Manchester City’s title hopes suffered another setback after they drew with Hull. Chelsea are now seven points clear at the top after winning at Aston Villa. Celtic remain on course for a domestic treble after beating Dundee 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup. They took seven minutes to find the target at D A&E e -- at Dens Park.

As an Arsenal fan he won’t have enjoyed what happened this afternoon as Spurs came out in top in the north London derby. Harry Kane kept UP north London derby. Harry Kane kept up his credible form scoring twice for Tottenham. Tottenham have spent recent years under development, building a new ground, constructing a new team. Here theyjudged the strength of the foundations by how they hold up against Arsenal and Spurs neighbours have discovered a ruthless streak of late. From there things would be harder for that corner of north London. This time there was space in front of Rose, not behind. The margins were slim but still in Arsenal’s favour. Tottenham needed a moment of clarity. The solution was home grown, Harry Kane’s finish was cold and detached. The celebration anything but. A Spurs fan equalising for Spurs. The excitement was catching. In the frenzied moments of quality count there were it two here. With five minutes to go derbies can be decided by instinct. Kane seems to live for these moments. His 22nd and most important goal of the season. Complete chaos created by calm. Millions of pounds worth of talent, a man from the youth team. Spurs had a hero on their own doorstep. Elsewhere, Manchester City’s title hopes suffered another setback after they drew with Hull. Chelsea are now seven points clear at the top after winning at Aston Villa. Celtic remain on course for a domestic treble after beating Dundee 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup. They took seven minutes to find the target at D A&E e -- at Dens Park. Ireland began the defense of the Six Nations title with a scrappy 26-3 win over Italy in Rome. They took a while to get going but pulled away in the final quarter scoring two tries in three minutes. Including this from Tommy 0’Donnell. Scotland lost against France in Paris by 15-8. That’s all the sport. There’s more throughout the evening on the BBC News Channel. We are back with the late news at 10.15pm. Now on BBC one it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Good evening, I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. A cyclist has died after a collision with a truck in Bloomsbury last night. The 25-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene, no arrests have been made. Cycling campaigners say it’s a notoriousjunction and want Camden Council to speed up the changes they’d promised, as Sarah Harris reports. It’s one of the busiest routes for bikes in and out of London and last night another cyclist lost her life after a collision with an HGV lorry. The police and ambulance service were called by people here atjust after 9.00pm last night. Sadly, it was too late for the 25-year-old female cyclist who was pronounced dead at the scene. Officers are asking for anyone who saw anything to contact them. Sam has been cycling in the area for years. His office is on the street. He says it’s well-known as an accident black spot. It’s congested. A lot of foot traffic but also a lot of buses and they’ve recently made new changes to traffic conditions which make it harderfor traffic conditions which make it harder for cyclists. Since 2007, four cyclists have been killed here with several others seriously injured. Safety improvements are in the pipeline but campaigners want them introduced urgently. We don’t really know what happened to this poor woman and it’s really sad. But cyclists coming here don’t know where to go, they get stuck behind buses. There should be a space for cyclists here, an extra lane is needed and Camden Council said they’re thinking about it but we are not sure when it will happen. It should have happened when they put the bus lane in several years ago, that’s what London cycling campaign asked for. It didn’t happen then. It’s desperately needed now. It was a sad irony that yesterday it was announced new rules will be introduced in September to fit lorries with safety equipment to protect cyclists. Out of the 13 cycling fatalities last year in London, five involved lorries. But campaigners want specific safety improvements in this area before another life is lost. No one at Camden Council was available for comment. A 220 million project to expand London City Airport has been given the go ahead despite more than 1,000 people voicing their objections. Newham Council approved plans which will create 1500 jobs and allow for more landings and take-office at peak times. Campaigners say residents have been ignored. Hospitals can be frightening and stressful places - especially for children. But medical research shows creating warm and inviting spaces on wards can help young people heal faster. An arts project in East London is taking that advice on board; it’s turned the interior of London Royal Children’s Hospital in Whitechapel into a fun and colourful environment for its patients. Alice Salfield reports. Pink and yellow. This is where Pippa learnt colours and shapes. It’s not the usual setting for a three-year-old, but she has a rare bowel condition and has been in and out of hospital since she was five weeks old. Her mum says the art project at the Royal London Childrens Hospital has transformed her environment. I am a firm believer in the fact that if you are unwell, which Pippa is, being kept busy and not thinking about it keeps her becoming worse. Keeps herfrom feeling rubbish. These cheerful designs were especiallily created by award-winning artists and funded by donations. I had worked with the patients on this ward and what I got from them was that theyjust really loved and wanted colour. Because also around here there is such an amazing community and it’s very vibrant and colourful and they would be the people using this ward, it would be amazing to make a place where everybody felt they could enjoy. These colourful walls aren’t just good for the soul. For children, in particular, coming to a hospital environment can be particular ly alienating. They might not necessarily have the family with them all the time so warm, inviting family spaces is really important for destressing and atmospheres and making the healing process faster. It certainly made a big difference to this little girl. A quick look at the weather now: Tonight will be mainly dry with the odd spot of drizzle. Tomorrow will be a dry day with some bright spells and a maximum temperature of 8C. That’s it from the weekend team. We’re back tomorrow at 5.50pm. Enjoy your evening. Bye. Hello. I am Hello. Iam not offer up the same level of excitement as today’s rugby and football. Nevertheless, we had a fair amount football. Nevertheless, we had a fairamount of fair amount of cloud with just a little window of sunshine and highs in Durham of 10C. Further north and west there was a fair amount of cloud due to low cloud and fog and temperatures here struggled. That cloud will drift staidily south through the night producing the odd spot of rain. Clearer skies further north and west will allow for frost and fog yet again to form. Generally speaking, it’s not going to be as cold as the night just speaking, it’s not going to be as cold as the nightjust past. We start off with that low cloud and fog sitting there, it could affect temperatures. Elsewhere it will be a quiet day. We will have some sunshine coming through. The best of any brightness in sheltered eastern areas. Further north and west thicker cloud here and more of a breeze producing the odd spot or two of rain. Temperatures responding favourably. That breeze remaining an issue over the next few days with high pressure setting up camp across the UK. It does look as though things will remain fairly quiet. We have lost that cold February feel of recent days. Mostly dry through next week. Some bright spells. But it looks as though overnight we It’s week five of the blind auditions.

More than 40% of NHS investigations into patient complaints aren’t good enough, according to the health ombudsman. It is 200 of the season for Tony McCoy! Hanging up his saddle, AP McCoy, the 19-times champion jump jockey, announces he’ll retire at the end of the season. Good evening. There has been more fighting in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian rebels and government soldiers. It came as Germany’s Chancellor, Angela Merkel, played down hopes for a new peace deal, following a visit to Moscow. The plan calls for both sides to withdraw to a line of separation agreed last year. But Russia has shown no sign of supporting the initiative. Our chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, reports. And so diplomacy has ratcheted up. Last might, Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Francois Hollande flew to Moscow to discuss a way out with President Putin. TRANSLATION: It is uncertain whether they will be crowned a success but in our view, it is well worth our while to make an attempt. We owe it not least to the people in Ukraine affected by this crisis. Under new proposals, the rebels who have been advancing in recent days, would pull back to a so-called separation line agreed last September. A demilitarised zone would be created to separate the two sides. Ukraine is notjust a war on Europe’s doorstep, it is also its biggest test. Many are now saying the best that can be achieved is a cease-fire that freezes both sides where they are, and if that is the case, Europe will have failed the test to safeguard Ukraine’s borders. The key question, what would President Putin be willing to accept? Forthe Russian President Putin be willing to accept? For the Russian leader, this crisis in Ukraine is part of his wider battle. There is an attempt to restrain our development, to make people accept an existing world order headed by one leader. Such a world order will never sit Russia. -- never suit Russia. With no agreement in sight, Washington is talking about sending arms to bolster Ukrainian forces. Russia warns against it. ~ I take with me the passport and military ID of Russian soldiers, Russian officers, who come to us, and leave together with that. This is the best evidence for the presence of Russian troops. On Sunday the key players will talk again by telephone. Well, Lyse Doucet is in Munich for us. This year they are coming and saying we need military aid. Because by all accounts on the ground Russia is sending in its own forces and increasingly sophisticated equipment. For Europe, not only is the future of Ukraine at stake, but they feel that if this situation continues in Ukraine, a similar situation could develop elsewhere. They talk about the ghosts of the Cold War. Both sides are accusing the other of not respecting their backyard, of not respecting sacred principles. All the while, Ukraine is being torn apart. The way the NHS investigates serious complaints, including those where patients have died, has been strongly criticised by the health watchdog in England. The ombudsman says many of the inquiries are inadequate, and patients and their families are being let down. Daniel Boettcher has the details. When patients or their families have complaints about the care they have received or if mistakes have been made, those concerns are investigated by NHS trusts themselves and if they are not resolved they can be taken to the Health Service ombudsman. A review of complaints referred has found serious failings in the way that they are handled by some NHS trusts in England. It is unforgivable, in a sense, that when people are alleging there has been avoidable harm and sometimes even when it is very clear that the harm is such that it should be recorded as a serious incident and warranting an investigation, that either those investigations are not happening, or when they are happening they are flawed and lessons cannot be learned. The report found there were significant variation in the quality of NHS investigations. It examined 150 cases involving allegations of avoidable harm and death and it found that 40% of investigations were inadequate. In one case, a day-old baby suffered permanent brain damage because of what the report called serious mistakes during a blood transfusion. It said the hospital’s investigation into the case was fundamentally flawed. The ombudsman’s office was accused of failing families in a recent report by a charity. Those pushing for a better system of complaints say that change must happen faster. That will require cultural change as well as changes to processes so that everybody can see that complaints are important and that complaints are there to learn from. The Department of Health says hospitals now have a legal duty to apologise to patients when mistakes happen and that it has made this a key element of tougher hospital inspections. The Prince of Wales has arrived in the Middle East for a six-day tour that begins injordan, a country still in shock following the murder by Islamic State of one of its pilots. Our royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell is travelling with him. And, Nick, feelings there are still very raw? Yes. This is a country which is still feeling very deeply the shock and anger at the murder a view days ago of the young air force pilot by Islamic State. Prince Charles arrived here this evening and he is due to meet King Abdullah ofjordan tomorrow. Charles is greatly respected by the Royal Family here. We know of his long-standing interest in Islam, his promotion of interfaith dialogue. Prince Charles agonises over the position of Christians driven out by Islamic State. He met a group of them here this evening. He met a group of them here this evening. , driven towards Islamic State. When he meets King Abdullah tomorrow, Charles will express Britain’s empathy and solidarity with jordan in the fight against Islamic State. jordan would like something more definitive, more support for the training of its armed forces, more cash to deal with the refugees, and I’m sure those points which will be taken on board by Charles and the senior Foreign Office officials travelling with him. Ed Miliband says a Labour government will clamp down on what he sees as British tax havens such as Bermuda and jersey, if his party wins the general election. Mr Miliband said they would have six months to ""open their books"" or be placed on an international blacklist. The Conservatives say no other Western economy has agreed to the proposed tax register and the plan wouldn’t work. Our political correspondent Chris Mason reports. Sun, sea and, if you believe Labour, too much secrecy over tax too. Places like the Isle of Man or jersey are magnets for money, attracted offshore by low tax rates. Enter Ed Miliband. Demanding change. The current Conservative leadership have become the political wing of the offshore hedge funds is. Unlike them, we will not stand by. We will ensure a country where everyone plays by the rules from top to bottom. The Channel Islands and others say they have never been more transparent. But when it comes to tax, they are effectively independent. The Prime Minister invited their leaders to Downing Street two years ago. Conservatives say things have improved since then, but more can be done. But our labour’s plans workable? No say the Torres, because the body that oversees international tax rules would have to do something impossible. Essentially he is asking the likes of Bermuda and the Cayman Islands to do things that the likes of Bermuda, France and the US have not agreed to. The idea that the OECD is going to put these countries onto a blacklist is completely unrealistic. Labour say it is ludicrous to compare France and Germany with Ireland’s financial centres that they see as tax havens. Instead Ed Miliband thinks there should be a focus on getting tax that he thinks should be headed here to the Treasury to actually arrived. -- on island tax havens. But how quickly that could happen, if at all, remains a big question. Nigeria has postponed elections that were due next Saturday due to concerns about the country’s security. They will now be held on the 28th of March. There had been debate in Nigeria about whether it was possible to hold a ballot while Boko Haram militants occupied much of the north-east of the country and hundreds of thousands of people are displaced. With all the sport, here’s Katie Gornall at the BBC Sport Centre. We have football and Six Nations rugby on the way, but first the world of racing was left stunned today as Tony McCoy announced he will retire at the end of the season. Regarded by many as the greatest everjump jockey, he revealed his decision after winning at Newbury this afternoon. Patrick Gearey reports. A jockey Ajockey apart. own again, riding Mr Mole, his 4322nd winner, he had the stage to himself to announce the end of his career. I want to go out on top. As championjockey. It will career. I want to go out on top. As champion jockey. It will be my 20th year, if I can win the championship. I want to go out while I still enjoy riding and while I am still relatively at the top. Relatively at the top is an understatement. 19 times McCoy has been the champion jockey. Do go over the jumps, he has had to endure the Downs. Breaking weight by missing meals, breaking-- making weight by missing meals, breaking most of the bones in his body, and freezing to recover. For a long time he had not one sport’s most famous race, but with his Grand National win a national attention and the 2010 sports personality of the year award. He rode effortlessly into history on Mountain Tunes. In this most unpredictable sport, the nearest thing to a guarantee is a horse ridden by a -- ridden by AP. Now to the day’s football, and depending on where you live, Match of the Day or Sportscene follows the news here on BBC1. So if you’d rather wait for the results then it’s time to turn off the sound and look away now. Manchester City have lost further ground in the title race after they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hull. David Meyler put the visitors ahead, before james Milner salvaged a point for the champions in injury time. They now trail Chelsea by seven points. Harry Kane was the hero yet again for Tottenham Hotspur, scoring twice as they came from behind to beat Arsenal 2-1 in the North London Derby. The win lifts them above their rivals and up to 5th. So Chelsea extend their lead at the top with a 2-1 win at Aston Villa. Crystal Palace continued their resurgence under Alan Pardew with a 1-0 win at Leicester. Steven Gerrard’s final league Merseyside derby ended in a 0-0 stalemate at Goodison Park, while Southampton struck in the 93rd minute to beat QPR 1-0. And jermaine Defoe scored again for Sunderland as they drew with Swansea. Celtic remain on course for a domestic treble after beating Dundee 2-0 to reach the quarter finals of the Scottish Cup. Leigh Griffiths gave them the lead afterjust seven minutes at Dens Park with his third goal in four games. Stefan johansen added a second after the break. Ireland began the defence of their Six Nations title with a scrappy 26-3 win over Italy in Rome. They took a while to get going, but pulled away in the final quarter, scoring two tries in 3 minutes, including this from Tommy O’Donnell, who was a late addition to the starting line-up. Over in Paris, Scotland lost by 15 points to 8 against France, despite Douggie Fife scoring the only try of the game. All of the points for the home side came from the boot of Camille Lopez. It’s the ninth year in a row that Scotland have lost their opening Six Nations encounter. That is all the sport. Thank you very much. That is all from me. Good night. Our weather story is all about cloud cover through this weekend and into next week. Sunshine across south-west Wales and north-east England. A high of tell sent -- 10 Celsius. In the Lake District, fog and cloud and a cold dayjust1 degrees for Carlisle. The odd spot or two of light drizzly rain and clearer skies in the north and West, so we could see some frost forming and also some bends patches of freezing fog likely across Scotland, north-west England and Wales, with lows in rural spots down to -2 or -3 Celsius. Where that fog is low to clear-- is slow to clear, temperatures could suffer again. There will be some sunshine around again particularly in sheltered eastern areas. More of a breeze up into the far north, producing the odd spot or two of rain, temperatures generally around 5-9 Celsius. Again we could see double digits for sunshine. We keep the trees for the next few days up into the far north as high pressure really sets and tucks in across the UK. There will be a good deal of quiet weather over the next few days. Mostly dry, some bright spells around from time to time but we ",,

Drivers using the Dartford Crossing claim the new payment method to replace toll booths isn’t fit for purpose. And Alina jenkins will be here with a full weather forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. BBC News has discovered the identity of the Islamic State militant, known asjihadi john, who has appeared in the videos of the beheading of several western hostages. He is Mohammed Emwazi, a British citizen from West London. He’s believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012 and he was known to the Security Services. Here’s our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. Revealed at last, the masked murderer of Islamic State has been named as Mohammed Emwazi from west London. He is believed to have beheaded several Western and Syrian hostages, including james holy, David Haynes, Alan Henning. He has appeared in numerous Islamic State murder videos, always dressed in black, carrying a knife and always with his face covered. This is his family home in west London, visited today by plainclothes detectives. He was born in Kuwait, attended school in London and studied computer programming at the University of Westminster. MI5 have known his identity for some time. From around 2006, Mohammed Emwazi became involved with supporters of the Somali insurgent group. He complained of harassment by the UK authorities. He moved to Syria in 2012 and eventuallyjoined Islamic State. Scotland Yard have declined to comment on his identity. They say he is at the centre of investigations into the murder of several hostages. Within the ranks of Islamic State fighters, Mohammed Emwazi and other Britishjihadists, are acting on strict orders from above. Prosecution files have been prepared on all the senior commanders in hopes that one day they may be brought to justice. Well, our correspondent, Sarah Corker, is in the Maida Vale area of West London where Mohammed Emwazi used to live. What sort of reaction is there? This is a quiet suburb in a middle-class area of west London. Neighbours have been reacting to the news that jihadijohn, known to been reacting to the news that jihadi john, known to them of course as Mohammed Emwazi, lived on the street. They woke this morning to see six or seven plainclothes senior police officers knocking on the door of the house behind me, looking for the family. No one answered. They went to speak to neighbours to ask them if they had seen them. People living here have told the BBC the family lived on the street for three to four years. They have described them as normal, kept themselves to themselves and were quite friendly. They have not been seen for a couple of days. It is not thought that Mohammed Emwazi has lifted for a couple of years. One man told the BBC, you think you know a community but you never quite know what goes on behind closed doors. It is believed the authorities had known the identity ofjihadi john for some time now. That speak to our security correspondent. He is the most iconic symbol of all the atrocities. He is the guy who appears threatening President Obama, David Cameron, Western leaders, etc. He always brandishes a knife in a position localised of immense power. He has the choice of life and death it appears over his hostages. You have to put this into perspective. This man, identified today as Mohammed Emwazi, he has not been caught. He is still out there. It is merely that his identity has been revealed. It does not necessarily change anything. He is still out there doing what he is doing. He is acting under orders. He will be acting under orders of what is known as the local commander. Prosecuting investigators who local commander. Prosecuting investigators who are working under UN auspices to bring people responsible to trialfor UN auspices to bring people responsible to trial for this are looking at those above him who are ordering these beheadings. This is just one stage in further unravelling what is going on. And we’ll be live in Washington later in the programme with the latest on this story from our North America editor, jon Sopel. jimmy Savile abused 63 people connected with Stoke Mandeville Hospital- the youngest was eight years old. An independent report says one formal complaint was ignored, and Savile’s reputation as a ""sex pest"" was an open secret among staff but the report adds that the allegations probably did not reach managers. Our correspondent, Nick Higham, reports. It is about time you did something for me, anyway, because I have done something for you. jimmy Savile at Stoke Mandeville. He was boisterous and disruptive. He smelt and junior staff knew him to be a sex pest. For over 20 years, he was free to do as he pleased, protected by his celebrity. The hospital site was huge. As a volunteer porter, he was able to roam at will. He had a bedroom and later a plush office. The investigations into his time at Stoke Mandeville spanned 63 victims. The youngest was eight and the oldest Ao. just under half were under 16, some bed ridden with severe injuries. Most were abused in the 1970s and 80s. His behaviour ranged from inappropriate touching to five cases of rape. Many, like this woman, made no complaint. I was too worried to tell anyone. I vaguely remember speaking to the ward sister. I wouldn’t have told anyone else because I was too embarrassed. He’sjimmy Savile, I didn’t want to get him into trouble. It is sort of, he’sjimmy Savile. I couldn’t say a bad word against him because everyone looked up to him so much. The report says ten victims did complain, most informally, but senior managers were never told. One formal complaint was dropped by the girl’s father because she was so ill. We say in the report, had this complaint been managed properly, he would have been apprehended at that point. All of the staff involved, whoever they were, we have not been able to trace them, failed in their duty to protect. jimmy Savile behaved quite literally as if he owned Stoke Mandeville. He threatened to sue the hospital over the ownership of the National Spinal Injuries Unit, which his charity had helped to fund. He claimed it was the charity, not the NHS, which owned unit. It is a measure of quite how out-of-control he had become. jimmy Savile was a tireless fundraiser. That made him powerful. The spinal injuries unit was too big and the hospital could not afford to the extra cash he raised. Today the hospital has policies in place to safeguard patients and encourage staff to speak out. If NHS staff do not speak out, a similar situation could happen again. Well, another report out today suggests that most NHS organisations still do not have adequately explicit and robust processes for managing their relationships with celebrities. A further investigation has revealed his brother was also abusing patients. Our correspondent, Sophie Hutchinson, has more. Allegations have been examined in more than Ao hospitals. The abuse was carried out mainly byjimmy Savile but it was notjust him. In an exclusive interview for the BBC, one former patient told us she was abused at a psychiatric hospital in London where she was abused. he locked the door behind me. I am not sure exactly when I was aware of that. He turned round and dropped his trousers and forced himself on me. Springfield Hospital today apologise for missing opportunities to investigate the allegation. Over the course of 15 years, hospital records show she complained about the incident 14 times but says nobody believed her. I was completely ignored. It diminishes you. Apart from not being believed, you are also, because you are not believed, denied any appropriate treatment. Port into many hospitals paid a similar picture of a system where a deaf ear was turned to complaints. -- where a deaf ear was turned to complaints. -- a report. That is why ministers here have been told there needs to be a change in NHS culture. Our investigations suggest most NHS organisations still do not have adequately explicit and robust processes for managing their relationships with celebrities, important visitors, fundraisers and donors. Today’s recommendations say celebrities and important visitors to hospitals should be accompanied at all times and that staff and volunteers need to be more thoroughly vetted. They have already encourage staff to raise concerns at one trust. They have published a report of that is not a policy on recruitment and managing volunteers. It is this sort of action I want to see across the NHS. Its senior managers are aware of allegations of abuse and failed to report them, it should be a criminal offence. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, has been at the release of today’s reports in Central London. One of the key areas of anxiety is whether something on this scale could actually happen again. Yes, that was the task of Kate Lampard to look into the whole question, the state of the NHS and lessons learned afterjimmy Savile. One of the most striking conclusion she draws is there are features of this case which could be repeated in the NHS. Hospitals do have a little way to go to actually make sure they have the most rigorous form of safeguarding in place. She says, in the course of writing a report, she came across inconsistencies between different hospitals and the way they dealt with things. Some are stricter than others. She is recommending that NHS hospitals do that staff and also volunteers, the most rigorous form of checking, barred list checks. She is saying all volunteers should be subjected to that. jeremy Hunt welcomed most of the recommendations but not that specific one. He is not going that far in terms of the recommendations but not that specific one. He is not going that far in terms that. Other key issue touched on is the question of mandatory reporting. If you work with vulnerable adults or children, you might be required to report it. jeremy Hunt said there was no consultation on that issue. It is a very big legal area for further debate. And there’s more information on this story at bbc.co.uk/savile, where you’ll find analysis from our correspondents, interviews with some ofjimmy Savile’s victims and details of the investigations. Royal Bank of Scotland made a loss of nearly £3.5 billion last year. RBS, which is largely owned by the taxpayer, said fines and other costs had eaten into its operating profit. But the loss is a big improvement on the previous year’s figure, of £9 billion. The bank’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, is forgoing a shares allowance worth £1 million but he’s defended the payment of hundreds of millions of pounds in bonuses to others. Here’sjohn Moylan. It’s the British bank that became a global financial powerhouse. Bailed out global financial powerhouse. Bailed out with billions of taxpayers’ cash during the financial crisis, today, it delivered its seventh year of successive losses. In 2014, the bank made a £3.5 billion loss come on the back of big one-off costs and find, so it’s retrenching, leaving 25 countries to focus on the UK and Europe. That’s likely to result in thousands ofjob losses, including some in the UK. If you go back to our strategy from last year and make this a simpler, stronger and Sarah Banks our customers, the strength has come through, our capital is well. The underlying performance is strong. RBS was once one of the biggest banks in the world. These days, it’s ambitions are more modest. Its focus is on customers in the UK and despite the performance of its core business has been improving. Which is why controversially staff received total bonuses worth £421 million, although that was less than the previous year. But the chief executive is waving his. He’s also foregoing a £1 million share. Bankers’ waving his. He’s also foregoing a £1 million share. Bankers’ bonuses are always controversial but these are at the low-end of the spectrum and they will get less as the bank becomes more of a retail focused bank. Like many of its rivals RBS has aside billions to cover fines and compensation payments for mis-selling products and manipulating financial markets. It’s cutting costs. But when might it leave public ownership? I’m not talking months. Ithink leave public ownership? I’m not talking months. I think the government will be a much better position as we head into 16, they can start thinking about the proposition of selling parts or all of this bank. RBS hopes it is saying goodbye to the torrid years of the past and that it’s moving on, but its shares fell today, suggesting the city needs a lot more convincing. Our top story this lunchtime. The Islamic State militant known as jihadi john, who has been pictured beheading Western hostages, has been named by BBC News as Mohammed Emwazi - a British man from west London. We’ll be live in Washington with our north America editorjon Sopel for the latest on this story. Scotland are beaten again as the wait for a first World Cup when goes on. Defeat Afghanistan extends their winless run to 11 defeats in 11 matches. The Victoria Cross - the highest award for gallantry in the presence of the enemy - has been awarded to a 27-year-old paratrooper for his bravery in Afghanistan. Lance Corporaljoshua Leakey helped a wounded American officer and showed ""complete disregard"" for his own safety during a fierce Taliban attack. He’s the only living British soldier to receive a Victoria Cross during the Afghan campaign - and becomes the second member of his family to be awarded the honour. Our correspondent Sian Lloyd has been to meet him. It was a act of remarkable courage. Lance Corporaljoshua Leakey has been awarded the highest honour, saluted by the head of the army. And in a rare show of warmth, he even got a hug. APPLAUSE - Brawley key was part of an assault similar to this one, when a senior officer was seriously injured. Despite being the mostjunior commander in the area he took control and brave machine gun fire to reach the injured American officer and give first aid. He then ran upa officer and give first aid. He then ran up a steep hill, carrying a heavy machine gun and started firing back at the Taliban. The battle turned and 11 enemy were killed. You’re bothering we are paratroopers and well drained and what we do -- well drilled in what we do. You are taught to think on your feet and think outside the box. To step up to the plate when you have to. He’s called himself a normal bloke, but now he’s anything but. Aged just 25, he displayed leadership far above his rank. I don’t look as being about me in particular, it represents everyone my unit, from my battalion, who was involved in the campaign in Afghanistan. These service men and women are just a handful of the 139 being honoured in total. They include some of the final members of the military to serve in Afghanistan. A reminder of the incredible dangers faced there and the courage and resilience displayed. Many congratulations. It’s an extraordinary story. Lance Corporaljoshua Leakey, here meeting the Prime Minister, is a modest hero, but hejoins the Prime Minister, is a modest hero, but he joins an elite group, one of only three living recipients of the Victoria Cross in the UK. The latest immigration figures show that an increasing number of long-term immigrants are coming to Britain. 298,000 more people came to the UK than left, in the year to the end of September last year. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor Norman Smith. What do we think is driving this? What today’s figures tell us quite bluntly is that Mr Cameron has failed and failed big-time in his pledge to get net my direction down to the tens of thousands. There’s nothing to quibble about here, we have a hard facts, the last set of figures before the election and they show that net migration is almost at an all-time high, at 298,000, up 50,000 from when Mr Cameron became Prime Minister, up 90,000 in the last year alone. The Tory high command weeping and wailing? Actually, not that much. Why? Well, it is what Mr Hague referred to, William Hague were referred to, as the problem of success. What he means by that is the success Mr Cameron has enjoyed on the economy is driving his failure on migration, because very obviously with a growing economy, jobs being created, if you are unemployed and the rest of Europe and looking for somewhere to get work, you look here. In other words, it is the success of the British economy which is driving the rise in net migration. Norman Smith. There’s no long-term future for the BBC licence fee because it’s becoming outdated, according to a report by MPs. The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee also called on the BBC to reduce its services in some areas, and for the abolition of the BBC Trust, the corporation’s governing body. The BBC has said it does not think the licence fee should be replaced by a subscription system. The Ukrainian army says it’s suffered no casualties in 24 hours, for the first time in weeks, raising hopes that a fragile ceasefire is starting to hold. But despite the lull in fighting, the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol is poised to defend itself from an attack by pro-Russian separatists. Ukrainian soldiers suffered a heavy defeat in the town of Debaltseve, and as our correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports, many fear this major Ukrainian port - just 60 kilometres from the Russian border- could be a target. On the hills outsite Mariupol, they are digging fresh trenches. Preparing for a new onslaught from the east. The men digging them are not professional soldiers. Until a year ago, they were farmers and factory workers and it’s very unclear how much they really want to fight. If there is going to be an attack on Mariupol by the rebels, this is where it’s going to come from. We’ve been told there is fighting going on about two kilometres down from here in a village. Even these freshly dug positions here outside Mariupol came under shell fire this morning. Most of the equipment here is ancient. Kalashnikov rifles and a few old Soviet-era armoured cars. Not enough, says their commander, to stop the rebels, if they come. TRANSLATION: We need better communications and surveillance, drones. We need more modern anti-tank weapons. They have Russian T90s, tanks which are much better than ours. We need sniper rifles and vehicles. Like your British Land Rovers, they would be excellent. Afterjust a few minutes here, we’re told we must leave. It’s no longer safe. As we’re driving away, two more shells explode a few hundred metres behind us. Further down the road, we’re stopped at a checkpoint. Like everyone here, the soldiers speak fluent Russian. But any warm feelings they once had for their cousins across the border is now long gone. I don’t feel like that any more, he says. The Russians are a bunch of mercenaries and cut-throats. They came to Ukraine, we don’t go to them. Then, as we wait to clear the checkpoint something very strange happens. While we’ve been waiting at the checkpoint, we’ve seen one group of what looked like Ukrainian militia men draw up in cars heavily armed, who were then held at gun point and disarmed by the Ukrainian soldiers on this checkpoint. For a while, it was very tense. It gives you an idea ofjust how chaotic and how much confusion there is here between different units of the Ukrainian military. Eventually, the stand-off ends and someone leaves in a great hurry. Such confusion and suspicion does not bode well for the ability of the forces here to defend this city against rebel attack. Prince William is to start work soon as an air ambulance pilot. Kensington Palace says the prince, who’s just arrived in Tokyo on a tour ofjapan and China, has now qualified as a civilian pilot, and will work for East Anglian Air Ambulance. Our royal correspondent Peter Hunt sent this report. It contains some flash photography. First Tokyo, later Beijing. This overseas visit to japan and China will be Prince William’s most important yet. Any messages for the japanese? Thank you. He’s travelled 6000 miles. He’s in a different continent, but the weather is familiar. As the Prince takes in the sights Tokyo asked to offer. They will have to share their affection from afar, his son and wife have stayed at home. Another reminder of his roots for a future king, here to promote the link between the two countries. This is bread and butter Royal work, countries. This is bread and butter Royalwork, but Royal work, but William won’t be doing it all the time. He’sjust passed the exams that means soon he’ll be a full-time air ambulance pilot. Throughout his time injapan William will witness the country’s mix of the traditional and modern. His guide here is the capital’s Governor, at a spot first visited by a British Royal when Victoria was Queen. The mildly anxious Prince was the guest at a veryjapanese ritual, a tea ceremony designed to instil harmony and purity, the same grandmaster performed the same role for William’s parents and for his grandmother. Foras for William’s parents and for his grandmother. For as long as he can Prince William willjuggle visit such as this with his new dayjob as an airambulance such as this with his new dayjob as an air ambulance pilot. an airambulance pilot. He is the heir but want to the throne so he’s decided he doesn’t have to become a full-time Royal. He will honour those from the Commonwealth who died here as prisoners of war and will meet some of those who suffered when a devastating tsunami struck in 2011. Last night’s Brit Awards belonged to Madonna - for reasons that weren’t planned. The 56 year old stole the show when she tumbled down some steps during her performance of her new single Living For Love. Our correspondent Sangita Myska reports. It was the biggest upset of the night and it had nothing to do with the music. 20 years after she last performed here, Madonna returned to the Brits stage - only to fall off. Her cape had failed to detach on cue. Remarkably, she carried on - a reminder of why she’s been a star longer than some nominees have been alive. Back to the awards and there were no big surprises. In recognition of his incredible four Grammys, Sam Smith took Best Global Success and British Breakthrough Act. But along with the prizes, he told me that it’s matters of the heart he’d like to focus on next. If you had one wish coming here, what would it be? I would like a boyfriend. You got that here first, people. Sam Smith would like a boyfriend. Any particular type? No. I’m easy. I’m not easy, but... And the winner is... Meanwhile, his friend, Ed Sheeran, deprived of the gong in the States won the prestigious Best Solo Male Artist and Album Of The Year awards. Winning isn’t really a thing that I’m used to so it’s always nice to win. To be honest, I thought Sam was going to get Album or Male, so it’s nice to get both. Finally, it was third time lucky for Paloma Faith. Having walked away empty handed twice before, she took her first Brit for British Female Solo Artist. I want to dedicate this to all the underdogs and all the grafters who work bloody hard, so thank you. And the Brits wouldn’t be complete without a bit of bad language, ably provided in the lyrics of a Kanye West performance, meaning large parts had to be muted, setting Twitter alight by a bemused TV audience. You’re watching the BBC News At One. Our top story today... The Islamic State militant known asjihadijohn, who has been pictured beheading Western hostages, has been named by BBC News as Mohammed Emwazi - a British man who’s from west London. In a moment we’ll have a full national weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first with news of the day’s sport, here’sjohn Watson. Scotland’s long running wait for a World Cup win continues as they were beaten by Afghanistan in Melbourne this morning. They needed just one wicket going into their last over, but a missed run out, handed their opponents a maiden World cup victory. Tim Hague reports. 22 men, all facing history. Neither Scotland nor Afghanistan had ever won a World Cup match. Who would break the duck? The first wicket julie fell for a duck. It was a dreadful start for the Scots. There was a distinct difference in culture and quality. The Afghans took eight wickets for 144 runs. Scottish hopes were not entirely ended. They had a record ninth wicket stand. While the Afghanistan target look simple, it was not in anyway. Scotland bowled brilliantly to leave their opponents in total. Nothing separated the two until this man got going. That one went on the roof and several others went close, as he smashed five sixes, including three in the 47th over, before dramatically being caught out the next ball. Afghanistan on their knees in every sense. This match seesawed in the final over as well. Scotland missed a simple run out to win it and you can probably guess what happened as a result. The Afghans were victorious with the next ball. The duck has been broken, history for Afghanistan and heartbreak for Scotland. Well, England’s next opponents in Pool A, Sri Lanka, had a convincing 92-run win over Bangladesh earlier in Melbourne. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara scored hundreds as Sri Lanka made the most of some poor fielding to post a massive 332-1. And they bowled well in defence of that total too, restricting their opponents to 100 for five. Lasith Malinga took 3 for 35 as Bangladesh were bowled out for 240. Sri Lanka have two wins and one defeat from three matches, and face England on Saturday night in Wellington. Andy Murray suffered a shock defeat at the ATP Dubai Championships. The world number three and two-time Major champion was beaten by the 18 year old, Borna Coritch, who’s ranked number 84 in the world. jim Lumsden has more. Andy Murray had so far preceded unhindered and had been expected to brush aside the Croatian teenager. He broke into the top 100 last year. The 18-year-old showed why he is held in such high regard. With a double break, he took the first set 6-1. Andy Murray was to win just five points on his serve. The Croatian returned everything sent to him and forcing more mistakes from the world number three. The 18-year-old was good in every area. When Andy Murray looked like producing a winner, Borna Coritch came up with something special. Borna Coritch sent the Scot hurtling out of the championships. His a name to a member on a day to forget for Andy Murray. -- to remember. That’s all the sport for now. Goodbye. More now on our top story - the Islamic State militant known as jihadi john, who has been pictured beheading Western hostages, has been named by BBC News as Mohammed Emwazi - a British man who’s believed to be from West London. Let’s speak to our North America editor, jon Sopel. Any reaction to all of this from the White House so far? The White House hasissued White House so far? The White House has issued a brief statement saying we are not able to confirm or deny the reports. The Pentagon has said it tiny bit more. Admiraljohn Kirby said everyone would like to know who the individual is. The Pentagon and US military was concentrating on fighting Islamic State, rather than naming individuals. One other quote from the British Embassy in Washington. Seniorspokeswoman said, our Prime Minister has been clear we want all those who have committed murder to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation. It is not appropriate for the Government to comment further. That reinforces what Scotland Yard have said, there are lives at risk by commenting and they do not want to do that at the moment. All the various agencies have been talking to each other this morning about this and what the appropriate response would be. A quick sense as to whether there would be more interest in the US about who this man is. Absolutely. His menace, his threats, his taunts, when the first video came out, the execution of james Foley galvanised public opinion that something had to be done. With the release of that video, and jihadi be done. With the release of that video, andjihadijohn video, and jihadi john standing there, or Mohammed Emwazi, as we can now say, that changed everything as far as the United States was concerned. Thank you. Time for a look at the weather. ~ I feel a bit warmer having seen the snow at the White House. This satellite sequence shows a cold front coming across the United Kingdom. The cloud is more speckled bringing wintry showers over the hills of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The main band of rain is on the move, moving ever eastwards. It should eventually clear away later on this afternoon. Behind it, with the wintry showers, we have some cold air moving its way across the UK. This afternoon, it will be 8 degrees. It is quite blustery. The rain is dragging its heels through the afternoon across the South and the East. Across the North of England it should brighten up nicely. Further north, we get into the wintry showers over the hills of Northern Ireland and Scotland. On the eastern side of Scotland, in the shelter, there should be a good deal of sunshine. The rain will clear the south-east. It will turn quite cold. We will keep the showers going in Scotland and Northern Ireland. As the temperatures dip away, one or 2 degrees in major towns and cities, lower in rural spots, there is the risk of some eyes developing overnight and into Friday morning. The risk of ice is mainly for Northern Ireland northwards. It looks like a decent day for the vast majority. It could be quite windy in Scotland. Later in the day we could see wind is picking up even further. Some rain arriving later in the day. Top temperature in the range 6-9. Through Friday night, the rain in the West make steady progress eastwards. A lot of cloud around on Friday night. A bit of a breeze but the combination should help to keep the temperatures up. No real problems with frost to start the weekend. It will be a pretty great day on Saturday. Many places will be dry, if a bit on the cloudy side. Later in the day will receive the next batch of rain in the West. That will be accompanied by strong winds on Saturday night. It will be windy into Sunday as well. On Sunday it looks like mostly wetter weather with snow over the hills as well. That will slowly pull away. The further south you are it will be drier but still pretty cloudy. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Katharine Carpenter. Drivers using the Dartford Crossing have criticised the new payment method - claiming fines are issued incorrectly. It’s hard to register and money isn’t debited from their accounts properly. The new system was brought in in November to get rid of the need for toll booths and reduce congestion. Simonjones reports. The highways agency has been keen today to talk about some of its successes. Around 140,000 vehicles use the crossing each day. It says journey It saysjourney times have been reduced by around nine minutes. The big concern among drivers, about the number of people who are bothering to pay. A large proportion of foreign drivers. The agency says it is pursuing foreign drivers by international debt recovery agencies. The RAC said today, if the success rate is not high, it could bring the whole payment system into disrepute. I have also been speaking to motorists. Some say they have a huge amount of trouble setting up online payment systems and others say they have received penalty notices when they have paid. The highways agency says when you establish a situation like this, there are bound to be teething problems but it insists things are going in the right direction. Seven men identified as part of an investigation into alleged racist chanting after a Chelsea game in France have come forward to police.

The BBC learns the identity ofjihadi john - the British extremist seen in Islamic State videos beheading Western hostages. He is Mohammed Emwazi, a 27-year-old computer programmer with a degree from Westminster University. This morning, police arrived at the house where he used to live in West London. He had been known to the security services before he left for Syria. We’ll be looking in more detail into the background of so-called jihadi john and how he came to be radicalised. Also tonight: A series of damning reports reveal jimmy Savile abused or raped over 170 victims in hospitals. One tells how her complaints to a nurse were ignored. I told her outright that he’d hurt me. She actually scolded me and said, ""Don’t be so silly that you know what he does for the hospital."" Savile could have abused victims in A1 hospitals. One report suggests patients are still at risk from sex offenders. For the recipient of Britain’s highest award for bravery - the Victoria Cross - a handshake and a hug. Madonna gets into the groove at the Brits but her tumble stole the night and the headlines. Tonight on BBC London: A Tooting mental health hospital is criticised for not acting on allegations of sexual abuse byjimmy Saville’s older brother, johnny. And, Conservatives in Kensington are meeting to discuss who will replace MP Malcolm Rifkind, who’s standing down. Good evening. BBC News has learned the identity of jihadi john - the British man who has appeared in several extremist Islamic State videos showing the beheading of Western hostages. He is Mohammed Emwazi - a computer programmer from West London. The 27-year-old is thought to have travelled to Syria in 2012 and had been questioned by the British security services before that. Lucy Manning has more. The only thing visible, his eyes. Dubbed jihadi john, The only thing visible, his eyes. Dubbedjihadijohn, his identity Dubbed jihadi john, his identity hidden Dubbedjihadijohn, his identity hidden under a balaclava, knife Dubbedjihadijohn, his identity hidden undera balaclava, knife in hand, hostages as his mercy. Your military airforce hand, hostages as his mercy. Your military air force is Your military airforce is in Iraq. Now he has been unmasked. The BBC has confirmed he is Mohammed Emwazi. He was born in Kuwait in 1988 that moved to London aged six. He went to school in Saintjohn ‘s moved to London aged six. He went to school in Saint john ‘s Wood school in Saintjohn ‘s Wood in north-west London and then Westminster University where he studied for a computing degree. He travelled to Tanzania in 2009 but was deported and detained, accused of trying tojoin was deported and detained, accused of trying to join al-Shabab in Somalia and interviewed by MI5. He subsequently complained about harassment from the security service. One person who knew Mohammed Emwazi, the man who helped him when he claimed he was being harassed by MI5 officers. You might be surprised to know that the Mohammad I knew was extremely kind, gentle, softly spoken. He was the most humble young person that I knew. He was such a beautiful young man, really. It’s hard to imagine the trajectory. For the families of the murdered hostages, that description must be hard to reconcile with the distressing reality they face. The family told the BBC they are relieved jihadi john has been identified. We want to go and watch him to be prosecuted and convicted and spent the rest of his days in a Supermac ‘s prison. That’s American justice. At the London family home of Mohammed Emwazi this morning, plainclothes police officers, his family are said to be in shock though not sure it is him. The authorities have known the identity for some time but because of ongoing operations have not made public. From this school to Syria, Mohammed Emwazi was certainly on the radar of the police and security service before he went. He is another one now accused of allegations of murder and terror offences who was he says approached by MI5 sometime in the past and he was able to get to Syria, even though the authorities here knew he was connected to a network of extremists. He was named in court papers as an associate of someone on p8pâI’S BS BFI associate of SOITIEOFIE OI’I B papers as an associate of someone on a terrorism control order and part of a network that included a man killed by a drone stroke in Somalia. But Mohammed Emwazi alleged MI5 was harassing him, claiming in 2009 that they asked him, what do you think of seven slashed seven? Now we know who jihadis johnnies, the British and Americans are promising they won’t rest until he is found. With me now is our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. The BBC has revealed jihadi john’s name. He was already known to the security services. How key a target is he for them? In terms of the police investigation into the murders of British and other hostages, he is central. He is perhaps the main suspect. In terms of intelligence targets, the words of course, stable door and bolted spring to mind. It’s a bit late. He left this country 2-3 years ago and was early adopter of the Islamic State ideology and so it is probably too late to get hold of him in that sense. It has been very difficult to access that the US and others any of these people with all of American SPY these people with all of American spy technology they were not able to intervene in time to rescue Western hostages before they got beheaded. To put this into perspective, how important is it that he has been revealed today? It won’t have any impact on Islamic State’s operations and he is not the guy giving the orders. A command will give orders, approved by a committee of Islamic State right at the top that proves these killings. It’s the people giving those orders, telling them to do it, or the prosecution files people want to get their hands on. A series of damning reports have revealed how jimmy Savile raped and assaulted over 170 people at NHS hospitals. At one hospital alone - Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire - he abused more than 60 patients, visitors and staff over a period of almost 25 years. The youngest victim was eight. One report suggests public safety procedures were bypassed by ministers and senior civil servants because the Thatcher government wanted to encourage Savile’s charitable fundraising for the NHS. Our home editor, Mark Easton, reports. The scale of jimmy The scale ofjimmy supple’s sexual abuse is unprecedented and shocking. Investigators revealed the moment backin Investigators revealed the moment back in the summer of 1977 when the authorities could and should have stopped. This woman, just 11 years old at the time, was at Stoke Mandeville having a wound dressed after surgery. The nurse left and jimmy Savile came in. He assaulted me quite seriously. I was actually petrified and the smell of his cigar is something I will never forget. The smell of his body odour I will never forget. The smell of his body odour I will neverforget. I told The smell of his body odour I will never forget. I told the nurse this and she believed me. She was a lovely nurse. She got the sister in. I told her she had -- lovely nurse. She got the sister in. Itold her she had -- he I told her she had -- he had hurt me and pointed where it hurt. She actually scolded me. She said, don’t be so silly. I told my father and he went off to the sister and you could hear shouting. went off to the sister and you could hearshouting. He hear shouting. He was furious. A formal complaint against jimmy Savile was made but not pursued. The lead investigator says it was a key moment. We would have expected jimmy Savile to have been suspended from his duties as voluntary porter and the Vista have been reported to the police. The legislation was clear that this was a serious sexual assault. This is a mass missed opportunity, then? Absolutely. jimmy supple’s reputation as a sex pest an Opel bash open secret here. He was known to be creepy and lecherous. One young nurse remembers a memo sent to nursing staff, warning them of his activities. Did take’s report includes an allegation that jimmy supple’s secretary witnessed in the sort. She told the BBC she only has good memories at the time. I never saw anything untoward going on. jim was a fun person, he went down the wards, making the patient is cheerful. Alongside for hospital procedures, today’s report says government ministers and senior civil servants unwittingly facilitated his crimes. Gerard Vaughan was desperate to make jimmy Savile a poster boy for a new way of funding the health service to keep him on board. They overwrote legislation and policy. People thought that he was going to be able to bring a lot of money to the table and that he would walk. That was wrong. These findings do point to the need for a more formal process of enquiry with senior people from that time. There have been more than Ao separate enquiry reports already written into jimmy Savile and Ao separate enquiry reports already written intojimmy Savile and his deviant behaviour. Such is our incredulity, there will be many more. Patients at NHS hospitals are still at risk from ""predatory sexual offenders"", according to those who investigated jimmy Savile’s behaviour. An independent report into his links to A1 NHS institutions warns that some elements of Savile’s crimes could be repeated and lists a range of weaknesses in the system, including how the the NHS deals with celebrities. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, reports. His influence covered almost a quarter of major hospitals over nearly 50 years and today, an independent report intojimmy Savile and the NHS had a blunt message: Parts of the health service still need tougher controls. There are a number of things that I have found an investigation which suggests to me that there are still risks in the system. Could it happen again? It would be very brave of me to suggest it couldn’t happen again and I think there are still risks of people being abused in hospital. The report recommends that celebrities visiting hospitals should was be companies and said all volunteers should have enhanced background checks. But jeremy Hunt, while accepting most of the recommendations, says he does not want all volunteers to go to tougher checks. Hard cases make bad law and it would be the ultimate tragedy ifjimmy supple’s legacy was to hold back the work of the NHS’s choo heroes who give so much to the local hospitals by volunteering their time. local hospitals by volunteering theirtime. Kate Lampard local hospitals by volunteering their time. Kate Lampard considered but did not recommend the idea of mandatory reporting, making it a legal requirement for staff working with vulnerable adults or children to report suspicions of abuse to the authorities. There is a consultation process on whether that should become law which is underway in Whitehall. Lawyers forjimmy Whitehall. Lawyers for jimmy supple’s Whitehall. Lawyers forjimmy supple’s victims have been campaigning for mandatory reporting and say if there had been legal obligations on hospital staff, those who knew might have stopped his abuse. They did nothing about it and nothing can happen to them and it is mY nothing can happen to them and it is my firm belief that if they had been a criminal sanction in place, it would have been reported earlier and jimmy Savile would have been stopped. Forthose jimmy Savile would have been stopped. For those campaigners, stopped. Forthose campaigners, it remains a source of frustration that despite the catalogue of failings, no individual NHS managers have been fully held to account. A former public school teacher and head of a charity who abused vulnerable Kenyan street children has been jailed for more than 17 years. 55-year-old Simon Harris was convicted of eight counts of indecent and sexual assault on boys and of possessing indecent images of children. The judge said Harris had created a veneer of respectability that concealed his true character. Official immigration figures show the net number of people coming to live in Britain has increased over the last year. 298,000 more people came to the UK than left in the year to the end of September. It’s a rise of almost 90,000 more migrants compared to the previous 12 months. The Prime Minister had promised to reduce net migration to the ""tens of thousands"" by the General Election. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, reports. You have to come to Basildon Essex to understand why immigration could play a big role in the selection. The town has no great experience and mass migration but boy, do voters care about! The Conservative’s failure to meet their target could cost the party votes and seats. Polls suggest many voters have a healthy appetite for UKIP. People say UKIP are racist but it doesn’t matter where people come from. It is the schools being follow-up, not being able to get an appointment with your doctor. I am not sure who I would vote for but it would affect the way I voted. The Tories promised to reduce net migration to below 100000 and it is now almost three times van rising. This is been a bigger challenge than we expected it to be and we did not predict we would see those pressures but it is right we have that ambition in reducing migration down to those long-term sustainable levels. Rubbish, say the Lib Dems. The Tories should be embarrassed at missing their target and David Cameron asked people to kick him out of the failed. The Prime Minister promised no ifs and buts. Now that target is in tatters, three times higher than he said it would be. We have such a massive gap between the rhetoric and reality. Today’s figures suggest many migrants are attracted to the UK because the economy is growing. The government’s success of the economy is driving its failure over its migration and that could cost the conservative votes and help UKIP. These are staggering numbers and an abject failure by Cameron’s government to manage its borders. The Tories promising new benefit limits the migrants as part of the EU reforms but it is a promise that so far has few echoes on the of Basildon. The time hasjust gone 6:15pm. The top story:.

APPLAUSE Lance Corporal Lea key Lance Corporal Leakey was part of an assault on the Taliban when an American officer was wounded. He took control and braved enemy fire to reach the injured Marine. He then ran up a steep hill carrying a heavy machine gun to fight back. The battle turned and 11 enemy were killed. The paratroopers were well drilled on what we do and we are trained for moments like this to think on yourfeet. trained for moments like this to think on your feet. You are taught to think on your feet and think outside the box. And step up to the plate when you have too. The distinction is for valour, the Victoria Cross has been awarded to only 15 British soldiers since the end of the Second World War. In 2004 Private johnson be Harry was decorated for exceptional brave few in Iraq. Until now only two British soldiers were recognised in Afghanistan, both had died in battle. It was intentionally meant to be extremely rare, when you know somebody or meet somebody who has a Victoria Cross, this is a special day. Since the beginning there have been very few awards, intentionally, to keep it so. Lance Corporal Leakey will receive his own medal at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace. This exhibition charts the history of the award. Despite his modesty, Lance Corporaljoshua Leakey is now a hero, joins an elite group and is only one of three living recipients of the Victoria Cross here in the UK. Many congratulations. It is extraordinary. This 27-year-old is a modest hero, but we’ll be an inspiration to many. The Royal Bank of Scotland - which is still mostly owned by the taxpayer- today announced another big annual loss - £3.5 billion. That’s a lot better though than a year ago when it suffered losses of £9 billion. The company’s Chief Executive, Ross McEwan, has decided not to accept a million pound bonus. Here’s our Business Editor, Kamal Ahmed. RBS: The amazing shrinking bank. After years trying to dominate the world, today the bank said it wanted to be a simple operation focused on the UK. The chief executive Ross McEwan told me despite the huge losses the main retail bank, which includes NatWest, was actually making money. If you go back to our strategy from last year, we have made this a much simpler, stronger and fairer bank for our customers, certainly the strength has come through, our capital is well up, the underlying performance of this business has been very strong, a £3.5 billion profit, that is the best operating profit we have had since the financial crisis. RBS has certainly changed since the financial crisis seven years ago. In 2008 the banks assets totalled £2.2 trillion, that is bigger than the output of the whole UK economy at the time, that has shrunk dramatically since then with assets now totalling £1 trillion. The bank has also shrunk its workforce significantly, and employed almost 200,000 staff back in 2008. By last year that had fallen by 45% to 110 thousand employees, is also cut back on its international operations. RBS operated in 51 countries across the globe in 2008 and now operates in just 38. That is set to fall to 13. RBS has certainly become a smaller, simpler bank operating mainly in the UK. Bankers and their pay has long been a toxic issue. Mr McEwan said he would not take a £1 million allowance, saying he did not want his pay to be a distraction. Can you still see the public frustration that bankers are still paid millions of pounds and the taxpayer is still paying for all of the problems of the past? I totally get that and we have to make sure we have really, really good people being attracted into this bank to get the recovery so I can get that money back. That money could be coming next year with Mr McEwan suggesting that by then RBS, still 80% owned by the government, would be ready for privatisation. City analysts agree. The main thing holding the bank back is the fact it is still making a loss, so we need to see a return to growth. And there is also this restructuring issue, which is key, because we do not know how the bank is going to look. In order for a buyer to get comfortable they need to know what they are buying. With the legal costs for misconduct mounting and job cuts ahead, RBS is a long way from safety, but there are at least a few glimmers of hope. The inquiry into the death of the murdered spy Alexander Litvinenko has seen CCTV footage of the two main suspects in the hotel where he was poisoned. Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun were filmed in the hotel lobby and using the men’s toilets where high levels of radioactive polonium-210 were found by the police following Litvinenko’s death. Our security correspondent Gordon Corera has more. Caught on camera at the scene of the crime, prime suspect, Andrey Lugovoy checking into the hotel where Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned. Also seen in the lobby, his alleged accomplice, Dmitri Kovtun, both were staying at the millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square, both deny murdering Litvinenko. The former Russian spy fell ill hours after meeting them, poisoned by radioactive polonium. Back in the lobby, cameras show Lugovoy asking for directions to the toilet. A detective told the enquiry high levels of radioactivity were found there, suggesting it might be where the poison was prepared. Another camera captures Kovtun, also going to the same toilet. Minutes before, Litvinenko is seen talking to Lugovoy on the phone, saying he is on his way to the hotel. There were no CCTV cameras inside the Pine bar, where the men met. The head waiter said today he remembered nothing unusual as he delivered a pot of tea. But it was to that tea that radioactive polonium is thought to have been added, which killed Alexander Litvinenko. The enquiry was shown police graphics of the bar, the men were sat at tables one, two and three, purple shows the highest levels of contamination. The enquiry was also shown the teapot, a receipt for drinks is in Lugovoy’s name. From the hotel detectives say a trail of polonium tracks the movements of the two suspects, they remain in Russia as the enquiry continues. Gordon Corera, BBC News. The biggest moment of the evening at last night’s Brit Awards belonged to Madonna, but not in the way she had planned. The 56 year old stole the show and many of today’s front pages when she plunged backwards down some steps during her performance of her new single. Our Arts Correspondent David Sillito reports. # You empowered me, you made me strong. The Brits and the Queen of Pop and the cloak that did not come off. # I let down my guard... Ooh! Sitting 20 feet away in the audience was showbiz PR man, jonathan Shalit. You don’t fall backwards that far, land on your back and not be in pain the next day, whoever you are. You definitely heard a thud when she hit that stage. You could not hear the thud, this was a big fall, not a little trip. I am amazed she was able to continue because many performers would have lain there. The Premier League footballers fall over and writhe in agony, have stretchers brought onto the pitch, yet Madonna continued. And he add pineapple Studios in London, the dancers were feeling Madonna’s pain. Poor Madonna. How did she get back up again? I think you just go into fight mode. You have a split-second decision to decide what you are going to do. There is no other option, really, as a professional. However, there was also sympathy for the person pulling the cloak. I really feel for the dancer who did that, they have just done what they are told and they happen to topple one of the biggest stars in the world. Madonna, it appears, is unhurt, and in a brief message said, Love lifted me up, nothing can stop me. At times like this, you believe her. Iwould not want to be the person who tied that cloak! Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Darren Bett. There is a ray of light, rain was invoked tomorrow, but tomorrow we will have true blue skies. Before then, a cold night ahead. We will have a frost in places, maybe a few wintry showers in the north, where winds are stronger. Here is the colder, showery air coming our way, that has gone. Clear skies for the bulk of England and Wales. Most wintry showers across western Scotland and Northern Ireland. On the face of it, not too cold, those are the temperatures in towns and cities. In the countryside looking at a touch of frost. Icy patches following early showers in the north-west, but a lovely morning across eastern Scotland, England and Wales, we will see cloud increasing across western areas and maybe a few spots of rain later in the day. Across Scotland we will see the cloud increasing. A few showers in the West during the afternoon, not as many as in the morning. A few more spots of rain. Cloud across Northern Ireland filtering into Wales and western parts of England. Midlands and South East should have a lovely day, lots of sunshine. Much drier and a lovely day, lots of sunshine. Much drierand sunnierthan a lovely day, lots of sunshine. Much drier and sunnier than today. That is where we will see the highest temperatures. In the sunshine, very pleasant. Into the weekend, starting on a damp and dreary note, especially the south-east. It will brighten up for a while, but quickly we will see another spell of rain whistling in from the Atlantic. This is moving quickly through Saturday evening and night. Wrapped around this area of low pressure. The wind could be a bigger feature than the rain. Costs 50 miles an hour to the base of the pressure across Wales and Northern England. The worst wind blowing away for Sunday. But a blustery day with sunshine and showers.

Mohammed Emwazi was known to the Metropolitan Police and the intelligence services, but they have kept his name secret while operations were ongoing. This evening, the University of Westminster, which he attended, cancelled a talk by a controversial Islamic preacher. Our home affairs correspondent, Nick Beake, reports. As students were leaving the University of Westminster after a day of lectures, a police officer made his way inside. Across the road, colleagues waited by the campus. The reason they were here was evident online. The university had just cancelled a talk by a controversial preacher because of fears about security and it came on the day that ""jihadi john"" was unmasked as a graduate of this institution. The 20-year-old software student here was amongst those concerned by the revelations. It’s horrible there has been this, because there’s been other stuff as well so is not good for university. Other students were angry the university was thrust into the public eye. It’s given it the -- university was thrust into the public eye. It’s given it the -- a bad name and they may look at it in a different view, thinking this is where the uni where this kind of person goes to. I don’t think the university has anything to do with it.

The University confirmed today that a student called Mohammed Emwazi left here six years ago and said that, if he is indeed ""jihadi john"", here six years ago and said that, if he is indeed ""jihadijohn"", it he is indeed ""jihadi john"", it would be shocked and sickened by the news.

One doctor used to investigate extremists for the government as a security expert and he said ""jihadi john"" government as a security expert and he said ""jihadijohn"" is he said ""jihadi john"" is in a string of recruits in a pocket of West London. There have been several young men who have gone out from that West London region to fight in various groups aboard for the so-called jeff Hardy cause. What we really need to find out is how they are linked -- thejihadist really need to find out is how they are linked -- the jihadist cause. are linked -- thejihadist cause. My experience, I know that every case we have, even if it is a lone terrorist, is almost always an ideologue locally inspiring them. He may have now been named but there is so much more to learn about this Londoner, a man who was arguably the most wanted on the planet. He was an aspiring footballer who had dreams ofjoining a professional team, but last December 17-year-old jac Rush was found unconscious in his bed. The emergency services suspected he had suffered a fit. He had, in fact, had a stroke. jac now needs round the clock care. His family want to raise awareness of young stroke sufferers to give people like jac a better chance of recovery. Ayshea Buksh reports. This isjac Rush, a promising young foot all playing the game he loves. Now, the 17-year-old is recovering from a major stroke and needs 2lI-hour care. He has paralysis on one side and struggles to speak for the. Because he was such a fit boy, he trains three times a week and plays football twice a week and has never done anything wrong. We thought, why him? He was on his way to becoming a professional fund all. Last December he complained of a headache and went to bed. Dash-mac a professional footballer. We thought it might be football related because he was playing football on the Saturday and maybe he had a bad tackle. The former Millwall striker had his foot all careers likely -- stopped after her a heart attack on the pitch and he now runs a charity. A fantastic player and still has a smile on his face. I’m sure he’s struggling beneath that in coming to terms with what happened. It is difficult to comprehend as a young man. When a stroke strikes, the damage spreads... What happened is rare but not uncommon. This advert was aimed at helping people recognise what happens. jac is now recovering at home but must attend occupational health sessions for times a week. First he couldn’t do anything but now he can walk with help and he can say my name will stop its a lot easier. His progress may be slow, but with the help of his friends, family and football he is recovering. Seven men wanted in connection with alleged racist chanting following a Chelsea game in France have come forward. The men were pictured at St Pancras train station last Wednesday, the day after a separate racists incident involving Chelsea fans on the Paris metro. The former England footballer Sol Campbell says he is interested in standing for London Mayor in 2016. The defender who played for Arsenal and Tottenham is said to be considering joining the Conservative party. He told the Guardian newspaper that he has ""a lot to offer"" the capital. The process to replace Borisjohnson begins after the General Election in May. Discussions are about to begin on who could replace embattled MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind. The Kensington MP is standing down saying the cash for access allegations against him had left his local Tory party in a state of serious uncertainty. Our political editor, Tim Donovan, is there. Tim, what exactly are they discussing tonight? This meeting has been long inthe diary, as they saved. The main item was going to be the election of a new chairman of the local association as the existing chairman is standing down and, quite unusually, two people want the job and there was going to be a selection. Of course, it has been overshadowed by what has happened this week with Sir Malcolm Rifkind saying he is going. There were questions raised about whether he would come tonight. Originally, he was due to give the opening address and one assumes it would have been about thanking the loyal supporters for their work over the last year and onwards and up words to the approaching election. Some people suggested that, having had the whip withdrawn, that he might not be here. In the last few minutes, he has arrived and I asked him why he was here? I’m a memberfor Kensington and a member of the Conservative Party and this is the AGM of the constituency so whereas would I be? Even though you’d had the whip suspended? I’m a member of the Conservative Party and the Parliamentary whip was suspended, but it doesn’t hold to my political status. When you address the meeting tonight? If they ask me to I would be delighted. What will you say? I’ll be saying it to them. Don’t worry, I’m here to see people here and not you. I’m obviously disappointed at what has happened and that would be pretty obvious, wouldn’t it? Thank you. Tim, who gets the ultimate say on the selection process? There is a certain amount of ambiguity. If you hear what is coming out of the office of the party chairman, it will be very much then the who will decide because there isn’t long between now and the election. We expect three or four candidates on the short list but donein candidates on the short list but done in connection with the association. Some people caution against that interpretation because they say it is a large and strong association, up to 1000 members. They are an independent bunch and one MP said they wouldn’t take kindly to being the dated two. There will be a process going on at the moment, of discussion, and, presumably, in an ideal world there would be an accommodation where key figures of the party would like to see outsiders along with local candidates. They will discuss the timetable at a special session of this meeting tonight to decide what the association would like to see and when they would like to see it happen. More than 130,000 drivers, including almost 20,000 foreign drivers, have been fined for using the new free-flow Dartford Crossings without paying. The Highways Agency is now working with European debt recovery agencies and says foreign motorists WILL be made to pay. Simonjonesjoins us live from Dartford. Simon, this plays on claims by motoring organisations that the system isn’t workable? The Highways Agency are keen to point out that the average journey times side band has already been reduced by nine minutes, but motoring organisations say the big concern is the number of drivers who aren’t paying, particularly foreign drivers, and it risks putting the system into disrepute with foreign drivers racking up debts already of some £2 million. The aim was to make the crossing free-flowing but many are trying to get away with using it for free. One Dartford resident always pays up, but says the system has been a shambles culminating inthe family receiving a fine for a motorbike when motorbikes don’t have a pay. It’s despicable because if they quick enough off the mark to send a fine for a motorbike, albeit they are wrong, I didn’t see why foreigners should use our roads without paying if the residents of the country had to pay will stop then so should anyone else. The system has been overhauled so drivers no longer pay in cash that are supposed to use certain shops, or the Internet. are supposed to use certain shops, orthe Internet. Figures or the Internet. Figures show that in its first four months more than 130,000 penalty notice is worth issued with 56,000 remaining unpaid. Every day, the crossing is used by 140,000 motorists. If you don’t collect the money, particularly from foreign drivers, it puts the system in two disrepute. We want to see how successful the debt collection agency is. The Highway agency admits there are teething problems. It is more difficult with overseas drivers but we have issued penalty charge notices to overseas drivers and we will proceed -- notices to overseas drivers and we will proceed -- pursue them through a European debt agency and that is a process that has worked for other agencies. But some believe that some people are still learning about the new system. We don’t have enough information about the charge. Do you think some foreign drivers don’t know about it? Yes. But the Highways Agency insist the number of drivers paving Agency insist the number of drivers paying is rising day by day for the top tonight, the RAC say that if foreign drivers don’t pay they should be stopped as they try to leave the country and made to cough UP leave the country and made to cough up before they’re about to leave. The Highways Agency is say it is a new system and inevitably it will take time to get right. Still to come: The velodrome has seen a few racing feats in its time but find out later who’s hoping to be a world record breaker this Saturday. She’s been called the most important woman in British Art, and is credited with discovering Damian Hirst, whose paintings, at the time, were going forjust a thousand pounds. Since then, south Londoner Ivona Blazwick has transformed the way the Turbine Hall at the Tate shows its installations, and has spent 13 years at the Whitechapel gallery. This report from Brenda Emmanus contains flash photography. Adventures of the Black Square takes a unique look at a century of abstract art and how it changed the world. It’s already attracted over 50,000 visitors to the Whitechapel Gallery. Its curator is the director of the venue, the woman hailed as one of the most important figures in British art. Whitechapel Gallery has been the artist’s gallery for everyone for over 100 years. So we have form and a rich tradition of bringing to London and UK audiences the great masters of tomorrow. This was a place where young unknowns like Picasso, Pollock and Rothko had their first exhibition. Her career has also seen her as director of exhibitions at the ICA and curator at the Tate. She is chair of the Max Mara arts prize for women and has been credited as the woman who discovered Damien Hirst. I think he’s probably one of the most important forces in contemporary art and in transforming London itself, in particular. I think he has, at the same time, made the marketplace very visible and very much part of the debate around contemporary art. However, it’s not the only story. The median salary of most artists is £10,000 a year, so we tend to get a bit bedazzled by the market and a few key figures who can command huge prices. A proud Londoner, she believes the capital now commands the respect of the world as a centre for art and that a multitude of factors have contributed to this. There has been a long-term role that galleries like Whitechapel Gallery has played, but at the same time, the presence of the Tate Modern, the prominence of the Turner Prize and the great publicity and interest generated by the Freize Art Fair have really raised public COI’1SCloUSIâ1âSS. And that, coupled with the 4th Plinth project, and there’s a great cab driver test. Cab drivers can now talk knowledgeably about contemporary art and that’s not something that would have happened 20 years ago. All of this combines to make London one of the most dynamic centres for art in the world. Her dynamism has sparked rumours that she could succeed the director of the Tate. Until then, she will continue to champion the arts on every platform that her power permits. This weekend, it is hoped a record will be broken at the velodrome. Sarah Storey has told us she think she can go the distance. In 1934, Gladys Hamilton was a British cycling champion and training for a very important record. This Hamilton is training for... This type of cycling has until now been confined to men. Although the rules and training methods have been tweaked, the cycling record is still dominated by men. Last night there was a failed attempt by the Dutchman. On Saturday, game Sarah Storey could put the women’s record back in the headlines. We thought it would be cool to do a woman’s attempt and we knew Sarah was one of the top female athlete in the UK. She was tempted and I managed to convince her to do it. We said, ifl and I managed to convince her to do it. We said, if I don’t say yes, I’ll always wonder. I’m not entirely sure what sort of physical hell I might go through. The one-hour record is somewhat a badge of honour in the cycling world and the men’s record has been broken for times since 2003. But the women’s record has good that whole time. After travelling 28 when six to three miles in the allotted hour, the Dutch cyclist has the record. Recent changes about the use of aerodynamic equipment means there are more diet -- cyclist is ready to tackle it. Women’s cycling has developed over the last few years and is flourishing. A lot of the riders have the support and resources they need to tackle something as challenging as this. After winning another four Paralympic medals in London, she is keen to recreate the 2012 atmosphere. Everyone in the velodrome and everyone screaming at their TV will be part of the actual event and that will mean a huge amount. Her 60 minute trial right time and distance starts at three o’clock on Saturday. It was the talk of 18th Century London. A Gothic castle built on the banks of the Thames by Horace Walpole, the son of Britain’s first Prime Minister. Now after a £9 million restoration project, Walpole’s private rooms at his Strawberry Hill home are being opened to the public for the first time, Yvonne Hall reports. This is the Gothic vision of Horace Walpole. In 1748, the son of written is first by minister began converting several old houses next to the Thames in Twickenham into what he called his little gotten -- Gothic castle. He made it into a place that was deliberately gloomy and dark. No two rooms were in a straight line and it was all about generating an atmosphere and a mood. Horace Walpole is also known for writing this thick novel in 1765. Inspired by a dream he had writing this thick novel in 1765. Inspired bya dream he had in his bedroom next door here. It is said to have spawned the whole Chandra of Gothic literature including Harry Potter and rankings down. In this section, portraits are coming alive. ""He saw it quit the panel... Are the Devils themselves in league against me"". The design of the fantasy home was the talk of 18th-century London. People queued for hours to look around here. It was Gothic on the outside and the inside. It was the first Gothic revival house to do this in the 18th century and he was really trying to make it like an ancient castle. He described it as the castle I am building of my aunt has -- ancestors. But it fell into disrepair and ancestors. But it fell into disrepairand one disrepair and one charitable trust has managed to raise money to restore it, largely using authentic materials and methods. Now, for the first time, the private rooms are going on display. Strawbridge Hill opens its doors to the public on March the 1st until the end of October. Stunning, isn’t it? And now for the weather. Thanks. The rain has moved through today and now the skies are clearing. It’s cold start tomorrow but it looks like a decent day with spells of sunshine. Earlier it was a wet morning but the rain pushed through swiftly. A quiet night out there. Temperatures will drop away and we will see a touch of Frost by dawn. A chilly commute in the morning, but it looks like a lovely start to the day with plenty of sunshine and that will say -- day with plenty of sunshine and that will say -- stay well into the afternoon. Cloud developing but it won’t amount to much. Temperatures will creep up but staying in single figures. The change comes later in the day because cloud will drift in from the west and it will bring light rain and drizzle with a bit of a breeze as well.

Where did you think I was going? Brand-new drama... Hello and welcome to the One Show with Matt Baker and Alex jones. Would you do me a favour and hold that? Good choice ofjumper! We are in the middle of a crime scene on a case we are hoping to crack by the end of the programme. It is amazing that we are talking forensics, such a coincidence. Tomorrow’s script has been stolen. What will we do? And who wants it? Our guest is a deported criminal in the new BBC drama Banished, which is not surprising given how naughty he was as a child. Stop! Well, he grew up to be the mischievous Russell Tovey. I have not seen that the years. That was 24 years ago. I actually went in the broom cupboard for that show. It was a big break when I was 11. Those were the days. I loved that broom cupboard. I would were the days. I loved that broom cupboard. Iwould not cupboard. I would not say that out loud. From 21 years ago to last night, when you were at the Brits. We have to talk about the Madonna moment, when she fell off the stage. What was it like from your perspective? It was horrible. There was a glass and people were pinching each other like, did that actually happen? -- each other like, did that actually happen? -- there was a glass. You feel sorry for the dancers because you know that somebody will have got walloped. It looked like a proper fall. It was a bad fall, about four steps. She fell onto her hip, it looked like, and when she got up you could see she was furious. She got it together. The show must go on. She carried on. Ido know how much longer she stayed. I think she did a runner straightaway. We are talking about houses first. I love houses. At first glance, the details of a new development in Bristol read like any estate agent’s blurb. Two bedrooms, fitted kitchen, bathroom. But there is something unexpected hiding in the walls. Straw. The perfect house for you. The traditional role of terraced homes nears completion. But there is nothing traditional about these houses, because they are actually made out of straw. The last straw house that I read about did not even stand up to the breath of a hungry wolf, and the poor little pig living inside was eaten. I have come to Bristol to see if these straw built homes, which promised to cut bills and be cheaper to buy can stand up to being the houses of the future, or are theyjust clutching at straws? Building with straw is nothing new, but as you can’t insure a straw house, or get a mortgage for them, they have never been mainstream. But that has changed thanks to these factory built straw bales panels. They have been developed by the University of Bath and a company called Modcell. Craig White is the director. This is a wall made of straw bales and timber. This whole panel is prefabricated and laid as one piece. We built all seven houses in nine days. Nine days! It is a quicker and more efficient way of building. Research suggests homes built this way are cheaper to build, cheaper to buy and cheaper to heat. It is compressed straw. How does it compare to a brick house? The combination of the straw and the air creates this super insulation which stops the air and heat leaking out. He reckons they will cut heating bills from £600 per year, down to just £60. And in Leeds, people have been living in energy-saving homes for more than two years now. Since I have moved here, it has been a complete life change, in terms of being warm and not having to think about it. Lara used to live in a draughty flat but moved here five months ago and can feel the difference. My heating bill is about 20% of my former flat. The energy savings are really noticeable and remarkable. So it seems the little pigs may have been on to something. The new panels recent industry certification is the result of a research project at the University of Bath. Andrew Thompson was on the research team. We had to do a number of tests to allay fears about straw bales construction. We are all worried about it. We did fire tests, and we had a prototype house on campus and we tried to push it over to see how it would move under hurricane force wind. Blew away? It ",,
153,BBC1 London,26-feb-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at ten, the British extremist known asjihadi john, who features in Islamic State videos of beheadings, has been identified. He’s been named as Mohammed Emwazi, a 27-year-old from west London who’s been known to British security services for several years. Among his victims was the American journalist Steven Sotloff. His family conveyed their response. We wa nt We want him to be prosecuted and convicted in an American court of law and spend the rest of his days in prison where he will live in isolation. In London, one lobby group alleged that Emwazi had been radicalised because of rough treatment from the British security services. He was such a beautiful young man, really. You know, it’s hard to imagine the trajectory. We’ll have details of the path which led Emwazi to Syria and we’ll be looking at the questions for the security services. Also tonight, investigators have found that jimmy Savile abused more than 170 people at Ao NHS hospitals. A special report from Gaza, inside the attack tunnels built by Palestinian Islamic jihad. And the British paratrooper awarded the highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, for bravery in Afghanistan. Later on BBC London, Sir Malcolm Rifkind faces his local party for the first time after the cash for access claims and after the jimmy Savile scandal, claims his brother also accused hospital patients. -- abused. Good evening. The identity ofjihadi john, the Islamic State extremist who’s appeared in videos showing the beheading of western hostages, has been revealed by BBC News. Mohammed Emwazi is a British man from west London who travelled to Syria in 2013 and was known to British intelligence. A lobby group called Cage, based in London, alleged he’d been radicalised as a result of rough treatment by the British security services. Let’s join our special correspondent Lucy Manning in west London. From his home here in West London to Syria, from radicalisation in the UK the murder in the name of the so-called Islamic State. He was known asjihadijohn but so-called Islamic State. He was known asjihadi john but today so-called Islamic State. He was known as jihadi john but today the BBC revealed he is in fact Mohammed Emwazi. In this report, some emotional reactions from the hostages family and questions for MI5. It does contain some flash photography. The only thing visible, his eyes. Dubbedjihadijohn, his identity hidden underneath a balaclava. Knife in hand, hostages at his mercy as he taunted the West. Today, your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Now he has been unmasked. The BBC has revealed he is Mohammed Emwazi, a 26-year-old from West London. At the London family home of Mohammed Emwazi this morning, plainclothes police officers. His family are said to be in shock although not totally sure it is him. He was born in Kuwait in 1988 but moved to London aged six. He went to school in St john’s Wood in north-west London and then Westminster University where he studied for a computing degree. He travelled to Tanzania, he said on safari, in 2009, but was deported and detained, accused of trying to join al-Shabab in Somalia and interviewed, he claimed, by MI5. He subsequently complained about harassment from the security services. One person who knew Mohammed Emwazi, the man who helped him when he claimed he was being harassed by MI5 officers. You might be surprised to know that the man I knew was extremely kind, extremely gentle, extremely soft-spoken. He was the most humble young person that I knew. He was such a beautiful young man, really. You know, it’s hard to imagine the trajectory. For the families of the murdered hostages Alan Henning, David Haines, james Foley, Abdul-Rahman Kassig and Steven Sotloff, that description must be hard to reconcile with the distressing reality they face. The Sotloff family told the BBC they are relieved jihadi john has been identified. We want to go watch him be prosecuted and convicted in an American court of law and spend the rest of his days in a super max prison where he will live in isolation. That is American justice, that is how our country deals with these situations. And the wife of British hostage David Haines told the BBC on the phone from her home in Croatia that she too wants justice. I hope he will be caught alive. I think the only moral satisfaction for the families of all the people that he murdered. Because if he gets killed in action, that way it will be an honourable death for him and that is the last thing I would actually want for someone like him. So from this school to Syria, Mohammed Emwazi was certainly on the radar of the police and security services before he went. He is another one now accused of allegations of murder and terror offences who was, he says, approached by MI5 some time in the past and he was able to get to Syria even though the authorities here knew he was connected to a network of extremists. He was named in court papers as an associate of someone on a terrorism control order, part of a UK network supporting the al-Shabab terror group in Somalia. So now we know whojihadi john is, the British and Americans are promising they won’t rest until he is found. As we heard, the intelligence services had been tracking Emwazi’s movements because they suspected he was trying to travel to Somalia to join Islamist extremists there. But he did manage to leave Britain in 2013 and reach Syria. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner considers how Emwazi became radicalised and how he was handled by British security services. jihadijohn, jihadi john, now revealed as Mohammed Emwazi, has a history with Britain’s Security service. A known extremist, he has been on their files for several years so did they drop the ball. This is the classic dilemma, you don’t know the total picture they are looking it so while we can look in hindsight and save this is a figure from other investigations and appears to be linked to broader communities, some very dangerous, we don’t know how many other people there are in that community. The clues were certainly there. This man is believed to have had a major influence on Emwazi. As a commander in Somalia was Michael al-Shabab insurgent group, he helped radicaliser Emwazi here in Britain. MI5 knew about these connections. They allegedly tried to recruit him but it is theirs to have backfired. He told the campaign group Page... Questions will be asked as to how MI5, the Security service here, apparently let a known British extremist slip through their hands and head to Syria to become the infamous executioner revealed to the Mohammed Emwazi but what we will probably never know is how many otherjihadis MI5 have successfully approached to become informers, helping to prevent a large number of failed terrorist attacks here. His role as cold-blooded, sadistic executioner for Islamic State, is a blow to the intelligence services but does it mean they are to blame? The messaging you are hearing about the role of the Security service is a sideshow and eight an attempt deflect culpability off daddyjohn. He made a decision for himself to go to Syria to participate in this complex -- offjihadi john. to Syria to participate in this complex -- offjihadijohn. He remained at the centre of murder investigations. He may never be caught. There are many behind him giving orders still at large. A series of highly critical reports has revealed howjimmy Savile raped and assaulted hundreds of people at NHS hospitals. At one hospital alone, Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire, he abused more than 60 people. The youngest was eight years old. An independent report says one formal complaint was ignored and Savile’s reputation was an ""open secret"" among staff, as our home editor Mark Easton reports. More than 60 victims at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, almost three times that number across the NHS. The scale ofjimmy Savile’s sexual abuse is unprecedented and profoundly shocking. Today, investigators revealed the moment back in the summer of 1977, when authorities could and should have stopped him. This woman, just 11 years old at the time, was at Stoke Mandeville having a wound dressed after surgery. As she lay on her bed, the nurse left and Savile came in. He assaulted me, quite seriously. I was actually petrified and the smell of his cigar is something I will never forget, the smell of his body odour I will never forget. And I told the nurse this. And she believed me, she was a lovely young nurse. She got the sister in. I told her outright he had hurt me. I pointed to where it hurt. She actually scolded me, she said, don’t be so silly, don’t you know who he is and what he does for the hospital? I told my father and he went off to the sister. You could hear shouting down the ward, he was furious. A formal complaint against Savile was made, but not pursued. The lead investigator into Savile’s crimes at Stoke Mandeville says it WGS B i(ây ITIOITIâI’Il. We would have expected Savile to have been suspended from his duties there as a voluntary porter and for this to have been reported to the police. The legislation at the time is quite clear that this was a serious sexual assault. This is a massive missed opportunity, then? Absolutely, yes. Savile’s reputation as a sex pest, the report says, was an open secret here at Stoke Mandeville. He was known to be creepy and lecherous. One young nurse remembers a memo sent to nursing staff, warning them of his activities. Today’s report includes an allegation that jimmy Savile’s secretary at Stoke Mandeville witnessed an assault. She has told the BBC she only has good memories of the time. I never saw anything untoward going on. That is all I can say. jim was a fun person, he went round the wards, making the patients cheerful, buying them Easter eggs. Alongside poor hospital procedures, today’s report says government ministers and senior civil servants during Margaret Thatcher’s first government unwittingly facilitated Savile’s crimes. Health Minister Gerard Vaughan was desperate to make Savile a poster boy for a new way of funding the Health Service, charitable donation. To keep him on board, they overrode legislation and policy designed to maintain public safety. People thought that he was going to be able to bring a lot of money to the table and that he would walk. Those were the words of the civil servants, if there were any bureaucratic obstacles put in his way, and that was wrong. These findings do point to the need for a more formal process of inquiry with senior people from that time. There have been more than Ao separate inquiry reports already written into Savile and his deviant behaviour. Suchis our incredulity at what was allowed to happen, there will be many more. Patients at NHS hospitals are still at risk from ""predatory sexual offenders"", according to those who investigated jimmy Savile’s behaviour. A separate report, which looked at how the NHS should respond to Savile’s abuse, has warned that most hospitals still don’t have adequate measures for managing their relationships with celebrities and it calls for thorough checks on all staff and volunteers, as our health editor Hugh Pym reports. His influence covered almost a quarter of major hospitals, over nearly 50 years, and today an independent report on Savile and the NHS had a blunt message. Parts of the Health Service still need much tougher controls on the freedom of celebrities, donors and volunteers to roam round hospitals. There are a number of things that I have found on investigation, which suggest to me that there are still risks in the system. So could it happen again? I think it would be very brave of me to suggest that it couldn’t happen again, and I think that there are still risks of people being abused in hospital, yes. The report recommends that celebrities visiting hospitals should be accompanied. It says all volunteers should have enhanced background checks by the Disclosure and Barring Service. Butjeremy Hunt, while accepting most of the recommendation, said he didn’t want all volunteers to have to go through tougher checks. Hard cases make bad law, and it would be the ultimate tragedy if Savile’s legacy was to hold back the work of the NHS’s true heroes, who give so much to their local hospitals by volunteering their time. Kate Lampard considered, but didn’t recommend, the idea of mandatory reporting. That is, making it a legal requirement for staff working with vulnerable adults or children to report suspicions of abuse to the authorities. What is now clear is that there is a consultation process on whether that should become law, which is under way in Whitehall. You’re here now, so everything is under control. Lawyers for Savile’s victims have been campaigning for mandatory reporting. They say if there had been legal obligations on hospital staff, those who knew might have stopped his abuse. We need to and use legislation so thatitis We need to and use legislation so that it is mandatory that were a report of abuse is made, members of staff are obligated to pass those reports on. Campaigners are frustrated that no individual NHS managers have been fully held to account. Net migration has risen to its highest level for a decade. The difference between the number people arriving and leaving the UK stood at 298,000 people in the year ending September 2014. It’s way above the target the Conservatives set themselves in 2010, as our deputy political editorjames Landale reports. You have to come to Basildon in Essex to understand why immigration could play a big role in this election. The town has no great experience of mass migration, but boy, do voters here care about it. And the Conservatives’ failure to meet their net migration target could cost the party votes in seats like South Basildon and East Thurrock, where polls suggest many voters have a healthy appetite for Ukip. I think they are there for the normal person, for ordinary people. Working class people you might as well say. People say Ukip are racist, but it doesn’t matter where people come from, it is the schools being full up, not being able to get an appointment with your doctor. I am not sure who I would vote for, if I’m honest, but it would affect the way I voted. The Tories promised to reduce net migration to below 100,000. It is now almost three times that and rising, a figure the party admitted was disappointing. This has been a bigger challenge than we expected it to be, and we had not predicted we would see those pressures. But it is right we have that ambition in reducing migration, net migration down to those long-term sustainable levels. Rubbish, say the Lib Dems, the Tories should be embarrassed at missing their target. Labour recall David Cameron asked people to kick him out if he failed on this. The Prime Minister promised no ifs, no buts, he was going to make this his chosen target. Now that is in tatters, three times higher than he said it would be, and when you have such a massive gap between the rhetoric and the reality, of course that undermines confidence in the whole system. Today’s figures suggest many migrants are attracted to the UK because the economy is growing. So here is the irony. The Government’s success over the economy is driving its failure over migration. It’s a failure that could cost the Conservative votes and help Ukip. Yes, there are jobs, Yes, there arejobs, but is that if you have uncontrolled immigration, you also have massive pressure on schools, hospitals and change to communities. The Tories are promising new benefit limits for migrants as part of their EU reforms, but it’s a promise that so for has few echoes on the streets of Basildon. Palestinian Islamicjihad are a major force in the Gaza strip and their fighters say they’re already preparing for their next war against the Israelis. There’s a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza following last year’s conflict with Israel in which more than 2,000 Palestinians were killed and some 70 Israelis. Tonight we look at the warnings of renewed conflict. Our Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville and cameraman Steve Adrain were given exclusive access to the operational attack tunnels used by militants in Gaza. The threat of war is looming again in Gaza. These are the men of Palestinian Islamicjihad. Six months since their last battle, they have rearmed and replenished their ranks in expectation of the next confrontation with Israel. Whether it is under the ground or over the ground, we are prepared for any aggression on the Gaza Strip. The militants are keen to show us their readiness, so we are searched, blindfolded and taken to one of their secret attack positions. Buried in an olive grove, a sight to terrify Israel. Right by its border, ready to launch, 120mm mortars. There is an ample supply and there is more inside. The mortar pit opens into a tunnel, an escape route, that runs for hundreds of metres. This tunnel network is in the south of the Gaza Strip. We are told we are right by the border with Israel. You can see how well constructed it is. It is an extensive network. Palestinian Islamicjihad say used this in the last war and they are prepared to use it the next. Above ground, for now, it is quiet on the border. Israel promised to eradicate tunnels built here, but the threat remains, says the Israeli commander for the region. He didn’t want to be identified, but he too expects war sooner, rather than later. Hopefully never, but as we can see, their side is rebuilding the tunnels and continuing to make themselves prepared for the next fight. We are doing the same. I hope it will be a long time from today, but I am not really sure about that. The aftermath of an explosion on Gaza’s western border. They are almost daily. Egyptian soldiers are piling on the pressure and tightening the border, wiping out smuggling tunnels that have been a lifeline to Gaza. Egypt blames militants from here for aiding attacks in the Sinai. In broad daylight, as Israeli drones fly overhead, the fighters of Islamicjihad are training harder than ever. They and Hamas are regarded by the West as terrorists. More isolated than ever, their number one enemy though remains Israel. You had a 50 day war with Israel. At the end of it, what did you achieve, apart from 2000 dead Gazans, women and children? Our biggest achievement is that we stood our ground and that we challenged the occupier. Unlike the world, we are still able to say no to them, no to the occupation. We are still able to resist. From every angle, Gaza is facing a deepening crisis. The only thing that all sides agree on is that this ground could soon become the front line in anotherwar. The inquiry into the death of the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, has seen CCTV images of him arriving at a hotel in central London, where he met two Russian contacts suspected of poisoning him. It was also shown images of both main suspects in the hotel lobby and walking to a lavatory which was later found to have high levels of radioactive polonium. Mr Litvinenko died in 2006 after drinking tea laced with polonium. Both suspects deny any involvement in the killing at the Millennium Hotel and they remain in Russia. Royal Bank of Scotland has announced another big annual loss - £3.5 billion, following the £9 billion loss a year ago. The group, most of which is owned by the taxpayer, has hinted that more jobs will be cut in its investment banking division. The chief executive Ross McEwan has said he will not be taking his million-pound bonus, as our business editor Kamal Ahmed reports. RBS, the amazing shrinking bank. After years trying to dominate the world, today the bank said it wanted to be a simple operation, focussed on the UK. The chief executive, Ross McEwan, told me that despite the huge losses, the main retail bank, which includes NatWest, was making money. If you go back to our strategy from last year, to make this a much simpler, stronger and fairer bank for our customers, certainly the strength has come through our capital as well. The underlying performance of this business has been very strong. £3.5 billion profit, that is the best operating profit we have had since the financial crisis. RBS has certainly changed since the financial crisis, seven years ago. In 2008, the bank’s assets totalled £2.2 trillion. That’s bigger than the output of the whole UK economy at the time. Now that has shrunk dramitically since then, with assets now totalling £1 trillion. The bank has also shrunk its workforce significantly. It employed almost 200,000 staff back in 2008. By last year that had fallen by 45% to 110,000 employees. It has also cut back on its international operation. RBS operated in 51 countries across the globe in 2008. It now operates in just 38. That is set to fall to 13. RBS has become a smaller, simpler bank, operating mainly in the UK. Bankers and their pay has long been a toxic issue. Mr McEwan said he would not take a £1 million allowance saying he didn’t want his pay to be a distraction. Can you see the public frustration that bankers are paid millions of pounds, and the taxpayer is still paying for all the problems of the past? Look, I totally get that, and the only issue I would say is that we need to make sure we have really, really good people, being attracted into this bank, to get the recovery so I can get that money back. That money could be coming back next year, with Mr McEwan suggesting that by then RBS, still 80% owned by the Government, would be ready for privatisation. City analysts agree. The main thing holding the bank back, is the fact that it is still making a loss. We need to see a return to growth. There is also this restructuring issue, which is key, because we don’t know how the bank is going to look. For a buyer to get comfortable, they need know what they are buying. With legal costs for misconduct mounting, and job cuts ahead, RBS is is a long way from safety, but there are at least a few glimmers of hope. The Victoria Cross, the highest award for valour in the face of the enemy, has been awarded to a 27 year-old paratrooper for his bravery in Afghanistan. He’s the only living British soldier to receive a Victoria Cross during the Afghan campaign and becomes the second member of his family to be awarded the honour. Our correspondent Sian Lloyd has been to meet him. Lance Corporal Leakey’s action single-handedly regained the initiative. It was an act of remarkable courage. Lance Corporaljoshua Leakey has been awarded the highest honour, saluted by the head of the army. He then got a hug. APPLAUSE. Lance Corporal Leakey was part of an assault on the Taliban, when an American officer was wounded. He took control and braved enemy fire to reach the injured marine. He ran up a steep hill carrying a heavy machine gun to fight back. The battle turned and 11 enemy were killed. Paratroopers are well drilled in what we do. We train for moments like this, to think on your feet. You’re taught as an airborne soldier and member of the Parachute Regiment to think on your feet and think outside the box and to step up to the plate when you have to. The distinction is for valour. The Victoria Cross has been awarded to only 15 British soldiers since the end of the Second World War. In 2004, Private johnson Beharry was decorated for exceptional bravery in Iraq. Until now, only two British soldiers were recognised in Afghanistan. Both had died in battle. It was intentionally made to be extremely rare and when you know somebody or meet somebody who has a Victoria Cross, this is a special day, so since the beginning there have been very few awards, intentionally to keep it so. Lance Corporal Leakey will receive his own medal at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace. This exhibition charts the award’s history. Despite his modesty, Lance Corporal joshua Leakey is now a hero. He joins an elite group and is only one of three living recipients of the Victoria Cross here in the UK. Many congratulations. It’s an extraordinary story. This 27-year-old is a modest hero, but will be an inspiration to many. That’s all from us, don’t forget a first look at the papers over on the BBC News Channel, but now on BBC1, its time for the news where you are.

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at one. The Prime Minister has defended the work of the security services, amid questions about how the Islamic State militant known asjihadi john was able to leave the UK for Syria. Mohammed Emwazi, a computer graduate from West London, was known to British intelligence. Speaking at a news conference in Cardiff, David Cameron said he wouldn’t comment on specific cases - but said that the security services are courageous and effective at protecting Britain. Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, reports. A quiet good natured boy from a loving family. Mohammed Emwazi grew UP loving family. Mohammed Emwazi grew up in Britain, got his degree from a London University. Yet somewhere down the line, he turned into this. Today your military air forces attacking us daily in Iraq. Bloodthirsty butcher of innocent hostages in Syria, revelling in the brutality of the so-called Islamic State. One of his first victims was james Foley, whom he beheaded on camera. Foley’s mother has given her reaction to the revelations about her son’s murderer. He did have the benefits of a comfortable upbringing yet he is using his gifts and talents for such hatred and brutality. MI5 is now coming under pressure to explain why its officers spent five years talking to Emwazi before he slipped out of the country to Syria, eventuallyjoining Islamic Syria, eventually joining Islamic State. Today the parameter defended them. I worked very closely with our security services. I meet with them regularly. I asked them searching questions about what they do. And in mY questions about what they do. And in my almost five years of experience as Prime Minister, I think they are incredibly impressive, hard-working, dedicated, courageous and effective at protecting our country. But there is a wider problem in Whitehall. This country has yet to find an effective way of protecting the public from suspected dangerous individuals when there is not enough evidence to convict them in court. In western democracy will value the fact you are innocent until proven guilty. If a person has not committed any criminal offence, what can we do? This is a question we still have not answered. We have tried control orders. They clearly do not work. People have left the country while on them. Now that the true identity of so-called jihadi john is in the open, many will expect him to be brought swiftly to justice. But open, many will expect him to be brought swiftly tojustice. But in the model and mayhem of Syria’s ongoing civil war, that may be wishful thinking. ongoing civil war, that may be wishfulthinking. -- model. And Frank is with me now. How damaging is this case for the security services? They certainly have got a case to answer. I would be very surprised if the Intelligence and Security Committee does not announce an inquiry to see whether there were any mistakes made. Ratheras whether there were any mistakes made. Rather as you heard there from Chris Phillips, the former counter-terrorism offers, it is a tricky thing. We live in a democracy, thank goodness. If we were a dictatorship they would lock you up. You cannot put people away without evidence. Innocent until proven guilty. There is a grey area where there are people whom intelligence suggests are a danger to the public, they have extremist sympathies. They may be far-right. There are other forms of extremism. But the problem comes that you cannot just lock But the problem comes that you cannotjust lock people up. They are at large. They talk to them. Goodness knows how many people MI5 talk to. Some will possibly say, we will become informants, and we never hear about them. Look at the number of terrorism plots in this country in recent years. A heck of a lot. You have to assume some of them have worked. They have got a case to answer you. A lot of people will say you are wasting your time talking to them. Cage will say you are responsible for radicalising them. Others will say he was gone down this extremist group even before that. - - extremist that. -- extremist route. Labour has announced details of its proposal to to cut maximum university tuition fees in England. Ed Millband says no student should pay more than £6,000 a year, down from the current £9,000. The move would be funded by reducing tax relief on high-earners’ pensions, but some university leaders are worried that this could result in a lack of money to fund courses. Education correspondent Gillian Hargreaves reports. What price is fair for a university degree? Labourthinks the What price is fair for a university degree? Labour thinks the current cost of £9,000 a year is too high. And a whole generation of students are being saddled with debt. This morning at the College of music and Leeds, Labour leader Ed Miliband, committed to cutting tuition fees to £6,000 a year, if he becomes Prime Minister after the next election. We are going to reduce the debt on university students. We are going to reduce the debt on taxpayers. From September of next year the next Labour comment would reduce tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000, meeting our obligation for the next generation. According to Labour, the average student has a debt of Elili,000 per year when they graduate. For every £1000 paid out in loans, ÂlI50 is never paid back. And universities say reducing these will mean a shortfall for them of £2 billion a year. It is disastrous particularly for the expensive important courses in engineering, technology, in languages, that take a lot of facilities to deliver them. They already cost about £12,000. Even reducing it to £6,000 would make it difficult to provide the Staffie students need. Higher fees have not deterred young people from going to university. This year record numbers have applied across all social classes. Although Porcher Whitaker is the first person to go to university in her family, first person to go to university in herfamily, she is not first person to go to university in her family, she is not being put off by it cost of a degree course. At first it weighed heavily on the. I was thinking that £9,000 was a big iump I was thinking that £9,000 was a big jump especially from 3000. It is something that will not necessarily impact me now. It will have an effect later. I should not try to miss this opportunity because of the tuition fees. Labour is the only big political party to say they will cut fees. The Tories and Liberal Democrats have been quick to criticise the announcement, saying the current system is fair. Pays anything unless they earn 21,000. It is a good system, internationally recognised. Why the Labour Party want to wreck it is beyond Maicon pension. We have made real progress in getting students from poorer backgrounds to university. Something governments have been tried to do for decades. That progress would be at risk from this ill thought out policy. Ed Miliband also promised to increase maintenance grants to help with living costs. The changes will be funded by reducing tax relief on high earners pensions. That may well include some of these graduates in the future. Our education correspondent, Alex Forsyth, is in Leeds. Alex, proving quite problematic for a labourer, this policy? Yes, tuition fees is a potentially politically toxic subject. We have the last Labour comment promising not to raise them, then they did. Then Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had to apologise after the coalition raised tuition fees to £9,000. The Labour Party has taken four used to get to this point. One backbencher described it as a tortuous process. There have been internal bus stops. Finally we have this policy which Ed Miliband announced today, cutting tuition fees to £6,000. How will they pay for it? Is fully costed because they are going to reduce tax relief for wealthy pensioners. Ed Miliband was very keen to stress he thinks this will reduce the debt burden for the whole of society. He spoke of parents and grandparents who would be pleased that youngsters were not have the same level of debt when they leave university. What he does not want to do is alienate older voters by appealing to younger ones. Critics are already starting to pick holes in its policy. Some vice chancellors have said it will make universities more dependent on the public purse. We have heard from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats saying it is economically illiterate and will leave black holes in public finances. Labour think they may have come up with a politically populous solution but the critics are not convinced. Gary Glitter has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for sexually abusing against three girls. The singer, 70, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was found guilty of a series of charges earlier this month, including one count of attempted rape. Our correspondent Sarah Campbell is at Southwark Crown Court. There were -i-i’IEIâE WEIâE SOITIE the judge? Yes indeed.

It was in court to hear the judge told later that he did all of them real and lasting damage and did so for no other reason than to obtain sexual gratification for himself the whole -- obtain sexual gratification for himself the whole -- wholly improper kind. There was little reaction from Glitter. He shook his head as the sentence was read out. As he was being led out, fans waved to him but he did not waved back. He has been sentenced to 16 years. He will serve eight in prison. Lloyds Banking Group has announced annual pre-tax profits of £1.8 billion, and will pay its first dividend to shareholders since it was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008. It will also award almost £370 million in bonuses. john Moylan reports. Lloyds, rescued by taxpayers, in the red for years. Now it is firmly in the black. Last year profits rose to £1.8 billion despite huge provisions for costs like PPI mis-selling. Taxpayers still own almost a quarter of the bank. The value of those shares have almost doubled in the past three years. We went from a very negative position concerning profitability to a position where we generated £7.8 billion of underlying profitability. We generated £1.8 billion pre-tax profits. And I am really pleased that for the first time since 2008, the bank is paying its first dividend to its close to 3 million shareholders. Many a red light headquarters will see today’s results as a milestone for the company. Before the financial crisis, Lloyds was one of the most fun and -- financial crisis, Lloyds was one of the most fun and -- largely held shares and paid out the best dividends, providing important in comfort millions. Now those shares have recovered and the dividend is back. That is good news for Gilbert Wright. A former employee of the bank, you relied upon the dividend from his shares to supplement his income. -- from his shares to supplement his income. -- he relied. My pension now is 12,000 a year. I used to rely on 10,000 a year in dividends from Lloyds. My income really is basically most half footage should be. But the bank is also paying a big bonuses. Staff shared almost £370 million. The Chief Executive will see his remuneration sought to 11 million pounds. Is anybody worth that much? It is not up to me to judge that. What is important for each person, I understand people will be focused on pay, but I would expect and hope they would focus on PGY expect and hope they would focus on pay for performance. With the economy growing, the future for Lloyds looks bright. Six years on from the bailout, taxpayers are moving closer to getting their money back. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, is here. The boss taking his bonus, a rather different story to what we were discussing a day ago in relation to RBS? Absolutely. Yesterday Ross McEwan turned down a £1 million allowance that he was due to be paid. Today the Lloyds boss has said he will be taking his £11 million remuneration. He has said actually he will not be taking it today but in the future was the Government has substantially sold the rest of its stake in Lloyds bank. What a contrast with the two banks. Still losses. Lloyds hugely improved as a bank and its share price has gone up. Interestingly today, the politicians have not really nibbled on this. You would have thought they would piling. But George Osborne has been very careful, very supportive. And Labour as well say the numbers are big but Lloyds is a much improved bank. That is the key thing. 3 million shareholders will all get a small pay-out today because of the dividend. I don’t think any politician wants to fight that message. Our top story this lunchtime: David Cameron defends Britain’s security services, amid questions about how IS militant known as jihadi john was able to travel to Syria. And still to come: Britain’s most decorated Paralympian tries to pedal her way into the record books. Coming up in sport at half past, Andy Goode will start his first test in two years to face Ireland in Dublin on People charged with some motoring offences will soon be able to enter their plea online. The Government is launching the new service next week in England and Wales. It follows a pilot scheme in Manchester and is part of efforts to modernise the courts, which deal with about 500,000 minor Summoned for a minor motoring offence. Last year, proceedings were taken in England and Wales for 4.5 million of them. Motorists either had to attend court or plead guilty by post. But that has changed. Under the new scheme, you can plead to motoring offences online, 24/7, on your tablet, your mobile. For instance, when you are at the gym. Plea? Guilty. I was in a hurry as I was rushing to an urgent news story. Honestly, I was. Or out enjoying a coffee. Or even during a break at work. Confirm your plea. Guilty. The national rollout of the online Make A Plea Scheme follows a pilot in Greater Manchester, where over one-third of those with a summons used the digital service. Under the old system we would have paperwork which would be time-consunling to process. The new system allows us to receive the information digitally. We can file it digitally for use in the courtroom. It is notjust time that is saved. The pilot found a reduction? Clerical errors, fewer pleas entered late and reduced court costs. The online service is only available in the magistrates court for driving and driving without an MOT. It could be expanded. If it is successful, we will consider other low-level offences and where there’ll be a standard guilty plea. The scheme begins nationally in March. I may not have the full majesty of the law, but pleading to minor criminal offences seems set to become ever easier and more convenient. The UK Independence Party has given its support to the Conservatives’ timetable for dealing with the deficit. Ukip is holding its spring conference in Margate, in Kent. Our political correspondent, Robin Brant, reports. On the Kent coast they look out to the rest of Europe, which Ukip wants to pull back from. The members arriving in Margate think that day is coming. We are ready to get the surge and I am looking forward to the challenge. It is a one-man band again, isn’t it? A normal person likes a pint, likes a cigarette, don’t we all. Fair play to him. But that man was not here this morning, he’s on the road, or rather in the air. Good evening, everybody. Nigel Farage was in a conference in America last night. It was not what you would call a big crowd. Later, he confirmed to the BBC that Ukip is on board with the coalition plan to cut the deficit. What he will do is put forward another ambitious programme. If we are in a position of influence we will do our best to make sure this time it actually happens. Back in Margate, they are still revelling in the fact that last time they met this man defected from the Tories. Ukip’s newest MP got a hero’s welcome. He had a bold claim. Three times the NHS has been a lifeline for our party leader. Ukip is the party of the NHS. Thank you. That is the sound of a happy crowd. You have heard a bit about the manifesto for the general election. There is talk here about the party’s message. The truth is, this gathering on the north Kent coast is about one person. Nigel Farage wants to be the next MP in neighbouring Thanet South. One senior figure told me this is a get Nigel elected rally. There is more policy this time. It means scrutiny on a level this party has never seen before. David Cameron says the Welsh Assembly will be granted more powers so that it will have 'devolution with a purpose.' Speaking in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, he said plans include control over energy projects and allowing 16 year olds to vote in future elections. Here in Cardiff Bay, Assembly Members made almost all the decisions about areas like health, education and social services. Now as a part of a wider set of devolution proposals for Scotland and the English regionst devolution proposals for Scotland and the English regions t talk is about more powers for Wales too. This is the first one. Striking a new £2 coin this morning, the Prime Minister outlined plans to change the way the Welsh Government is funded. That could lead to a referendum on devolving income tax powers too. That is a beautiful thing. Today’s agreement paves the way for a referendum that would deliver an assembly that is notjust a spending body, but is actually responsible for raising more of its revenue too. To me, that is responsible devolution. That is real devolution and I think that is vital for Wales and for the United Kingdom. The drawing up of plans that issues like fracking, larger energy projects like fracking, larger energy projects and speed limits will be devolved. There is a nod to the next generation. Voting age for Welsh elections will be decided in Cardiff Bay. That went down well with these 16 year olds. They may think we may have like silly idea, but I think they should start to listen to us. If we were taught more about Governments and things like that, I think, yeah, everyone at 16 should be able to vote. Labour, who run the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Nationalists both said the proposals did knit go far enough. We need -- proposals did knit go far enough. We need -- did not go far enough. We need to see details from this election. That will not come from the Prime Minister until after the election. We need to determine whether Wales will be better off. What is important is what has been left out, policing, criminaljustice and welfare were discussed but the political parties could not reach an agreement. Today may be another historic milestone for devolution in Wales, the process is unlikely to be over. Britain’s most decorated female Paralympian, Dame Sarah Storey, will tomorrow attempt to break the able-bodied record for the women’s hour-time trial. She will need to cycle further than just over 46 kilometres in an hour, if she’s to break the record set in 2003. Here’s our Sports Correspondent Andy Swiss. It isa It is a challenge so simple, yet so brutal. How far can you cycle in one hour? Well, for Dame Sarah Storey the answer could be record-breaking. Her target of over 28 miles has stood for rfor more than a decade -- stood for more than a decade. When row are going around and around a track that is a dizzying distance. 184 is the current. 184 and a little bit more would be ideal. How does that sound to you? It sounds like a heck of a long way to most people? It is a ridiculous number of laps to do by myself frankly. It is one of those challenges in life, that if I turned it down I would always wonder. Why? The hour is one of cycling most prestigious records. It has lured the best. I refer it to as riding around in circles for an hour. It is the most unpleasant thing you could do on a bike for an hour. It deserves to be feared and needs to be respected. That is an outstanding ride... Storey is used to breaking barriers. An 11-time Paralympic champion, who has won able-bodied titles, now bidding to be the world’s best. Whether it is an able-bodied world record or Paralympic record, it makes no difference to me. It is about testing myself. She will be cheered on by her family, including one-year-old daughter, Louisa, not to mention a home crowd, all hoping she can win the race against time. Good luck to her. The Duke of Cambridge has paid a tribute to Commonwealth soldiers who died injapan in the last years of the Second World War.

And the family who lost a daughter to a motorist high on cannabis on the new law they helped to create. why aren’t all children eating them? Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Labour has announced it would cut university tuition fees in England to £6,000 per year from autumn 2016. Ed Miliband says the reduction in the current fee of £9,000 would be paid for by reducing tax relief for wealthier pensioners. Some universities say it could mean there’s not enough money to fund courses and public finance experts say graduates who go on to high-paid jobs will benefit most. Our education editor, Branwenjeffreys, has more details. Universities are booming, despite fees of £9,000 a year, there are more students and more from poorer backgrounds but today, Ed Miliband said even in coalition, Labour would cut fees. Let me say this directly to Britain’s young people: I’m a dual promise on tuition fees. I will keep my promise. I don’t want to simply build yourfaith in labour. I want to simply build yourfaith in labour. I wa nt to restore your simply build yourfaith in labour. I want to restore your faith in change that can be believed and that is what the next Labour government will offer. At the moment, students pay back tuition fees over 30 years. Those on high salaries pay off the full £9,000 a year with interest. Those on lower salaries Payless with outstanding debts written off. Under Labour’s plans, which graduates would pay less and poorer graduates would be unaffected. Isn’t itjust a better future for bankers, lawyers, doctors, the people who will earn most and benefit from this? I don’t believe that, no, because every young person who goes to university is thinking about this issue of debt. We are also increasing the grant for young people, a ÂlIoo increase. That is why it is better than students and universities in Britain. How much does it cost to keep a student away from home for a year nowadays? A significant amount of money. I know that lots of young people are facing real hardship and it’s really hard times for young people. Labour’s plans would not help students leaving this year with big debts and universities remain uneasy about the detail. They have been promised that the difference will be made up but that relies on a tax increase on pensions. This is a tax rise on pensions of about £3 billion a year. That is less than the total you get from Ip on the basic rate of income tax but in the context of the smaller changes we have seen in recent years, it is pretty substantial. If you talk to students, not all are impressed by reducing tuition dead. The problem on the ground is not how much we pay in tuition fees. We get that as a loan and we never see it but the maintenance loan is something that needs to be looked at. They need to say, we will make it free because that will wind boats. The Lib Dems argue Labour’s plans are financially illiterate. The Conservatives say the about the tax payers, universities and students. Our political correspondent, Carole Walker, is in Westminster. Ed Miliband clearly think there are votes in this pledge. Is he right? Ed Miliba nd believes Ed Miliband believes this will appeal to people of all ages who are concerned about the younger generation and it is very much part of that personal mission he has two address a situation whereby many younger people are going to be worse off than their parents and grandparents. It has been the result of a really torturous process within the Labour Party and some are still not convinced is the right priority to such a big spending commitment. He has faced criticism from the Conservatives who say he brings chaos to a system which is already seeing more students from disadvantaged backgrounds going to universities and some of the strongest criticism has come from the Liberal Democrats, who famously promised not to put up tuition fees and now say it would be a mistake to reduce them. Vince Cable has said it is a betrayal because the money raised would go to the Chaudhry instead of directly to universities. -- the Treasury. The Prime Minister has defended the work of the security services after it emerged that the Islamic State extremist known asjihadi john managed to leave the UK for Syria despite being known to British intelligence. Mohammed Emwazi, a computer graduate from West London, was named yesterday by the BBC. Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, reports. A sweet smile, shining eyes, yet this young schoolboy would some years later only show his menacing eyes through the slit of a balaclava asjihadi john. Today, your military airforce is attacking us asjihadi john. Today, your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. At his primary School in west London, a ten-year-old like any other. His hobbies were football and computer games. His school yearbook says his favourite book was how to kill a monster. says his favourite book was how to killa monster. No kill a monster. No one would predict he would turn into a monster who killed. Those who knew him from the area where his family lived say he was a strict Muslim and never thought he would get involved in terrorism. When he graduated, he was quite a happy guy. Nothing to do with something like this. We never realised that he would go on to do jihad. Last time we saw him, he said, I will get married, I am going to Kuwait. And that the families of the murdered hostages, the mother of james Foley’s cannot believe a clever boy grew into jihadi john. james Foley’s cannot believe a clever boy grew intojihadi john. He did have the benefit survey comfortable upbringing and yet he is using his gifts and talents that such hatred and brutality. How Mohammed Emwazi ten from eight pupil to a radicalised murderer in Syria is not yet clear. What is clear is that the so-called Islamic State were not the first to recruit him. MI5 tried six years ago and now growing questions about what it in the police knew. But those involved in intelligence denied MI5 had radicalised him. You give the opportunity to the individual to draw back from the terrorist groups he is about to mix with and you also give more warning but the idea that somehow, being spoken to by a member of MI5, is a radicalising act, this is very force and transparent. But with hundreds of Britons fighting in Syria, the Prime Minister promised to hunt the hostage killers. When there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and he missed crimes against British citizens, we will do everything we can with the police, security services, all that we have at our disposal, to find these people and put them out of action. The fear is the increasing number of British schoolboys who grow up and become radicalised. The former singer Gary Glitter has beenjailed for 16 years for sexually abusing three young girls between 1975 and 1980. The judge at Southwark Crown Court told Glitter- who was tried under his real name, Paul Gadd - that it was ""difficult to overstate the depravity"" of his behaviour. Sarah Campbell was in court. There’s some flash photography in her report. It’s almost Ao years since this man attempted to rape an age old girl. Todayjust has finally caught up with him. In the .com and he showed little reaction as the sentence was passed, just a shake of his head. One of his victims was in court to hear the judge tell Gary Glitter, you did all of them real and lasting damage and the no other reason than to obtain sexual gratification for yourself of a wholly improper kind. Glitter managed to keep his abusive nature a secret for decades. His lyrics were suggested, his performances sexual. This documentary was filmed a year after we now know he was filmed a year after we now know that he I feel as if it is a love affair that you have with your audience and you treat them just like you are caressing a woman, you tease her, you play with her. In 1997, employees at this store with the first to discover who he really was when they found images of child pawn on his hard drive. He wasjailed for two months of child pawn on his hard drive. He was jailed for two months and then jailed again in 2006 in Vietnam’s abusing two preteen -- jailed again in 2006 in Vietnam’s abusing two preteen -- preteenage girls. These crimes leave the victims of a life sentence so people who commit such crimes should not expect leniency. Back in jail for a third time, Gary Glitter will be almost 79 years old before he will even be considered for release. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories: It’s emerged Prince Harry is to leave the army later this year. It’s thought the Prince, who did two tours of duty in Afghanistan, is considering his options’ One may be to concentrate on charity work, giving him greater freedom to support wounded veterans and focus on Africa, where he founded the AIDS charity Sentabale in Lesotho. Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers have complained to Keith Vaz. The information was in a letter from South Yorkshire Police. China is to ban the import of African ivory carvings for a year. It was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008, but today Lloyds took another step on the road to a full recovery. It paid a dividend to millions of shareholders for the first time in seven years and the company announced annual profits of £1.8 billion but there was controversy over staff bonuses of almost £370 million. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, has more details. The black course of Lloyds, a symbol of one of the UK’s oldest banks and a byword for dependable service until 2008, when it went on the black to the red after the calamities of the financial crisis, it almost collapsed and was partly nationalised. After six years, it looks like it is back on track. I met the chief executive and asked him how the bank had been turned around. Ifocused the bank him how the bank had been turned around. I focused the bank on the UK, households, lending to SMEs. We supported first-time buyers and I have completely refocused the bank on Britain to help Britain prosper. Lloyds is a bank on the mend. In 2008, the government took a 40% stake as part of the bank’s bailout. Since then, it has sold toxic assets and reduce the number of countries it operates into eight. The share price has increased by 191% since 2012. Gilbert and his wife are two of the customers. That stopped abruptly when the bank nearly went bust. We used to rely on £10,000 a year dividends. The dividend we getting now is £750. It is a long way short of £10,000! Lloyds used to be in the doghouse but now it is rebuilt itself, offering bread-and- butter services rebuilt itself, offering bread-and-butter services and branches like this one. The man at the top of the organisation has been well rewarded for that success. Well rewarded to the tune of £11 million, the value of his pay package the 2014. The success of Lloyds bank has been centred today in the pay you will receive. Is anyone worth £11 million? It’s not up to me to judge that. But it is important that each person to understand the people are focused on pay but they would expect and hope that they focus on pay for performance. The sun might be shining now for Lloyds but there are still shadows. Lloyds may be a better bank but it is not perfect. It is 6:15pm. Our top story this evening. Labour pledges to cut university tuition fees by a third - £9000 a year- to £6000. And does this dress look white and gold or blue and black to you? Coming up shortly on BBC London. Boris Bikes go from blue to red - but is the new sponsorship deal a good one for Londoners? And the rent battle fought with the celebrity backing of Russell Brand - now tenants are asked to pay according to income. Now. At a quarter past six on a Friday millions of people are of course knocking off for the weekend. But for many, the days when work meant 9 to 5, Monday to Friday, are long gone. Women have worked part time in large numbers for many years but now there’s a new trend among working men, with close to one million choosing part time employment. Our Business Correspondent Emma Simpson has been finding out why. Meet three men with three different personal stories on why they pushed to work part time. Rob Sinclair is an accountant from Sutton Coldfield. With two young boys he and his wife realised something had to give. It was proving to be a challenge for us to keep both our careers progressing as they had been whilst also making sure we did not disrupt the home life and make sure we actually spend time with the boys. This may sound familiar, but it was Rob who cut his hours. It seemed to make sense for me to take the lead in moving down to working part-time to give me more time with the boys, let my wife concentrate on her corporate career and let me do some more time on my writing as well. He has to make do with less money, but for Rob life is now on a more even keel, that is what Richard Steele had in mind when he went part-time. I have been working very hard for ten years. There was never time to stop. The e-mails with Blackberries and tablets and mobile phones meant that there was no barrier to when work finished. But his pace of life has changed, Richard now works for a food business in Kent with Fridays off. It is a transition really from a very busy week, to recharging and having time for me. And to build up again so I can spend quality time with the family at the weekend. Rob and Richard are part of what feels like a quiet revolution. It is women of course you do the vast majority of part-time work, but more and more men are now choosing to do less than a full week. There are nearly1 million of them. A figure that has almost trebled in the last 20 years. Most of this growth is down to older men, like Bernard Brodie. He could have retired two years ago and put his feet up. Instead he is choosing to stay busy. Why are you working part-time at the age of 67? A. Money. That helps a heck of a lot. B. Boredom. I can’t sit around doing Nothing. And he does not intend stopping any time soon. How to find the right worklife balance in today’s demanding world. It is never easy, but these men are breaking the mould. David Cameron and Nick Clegg have been setting out new devolved powers for Wales. They include a referendum on greater control over income tax - plus control over energy projects such as fracking. But there’s been no agreement on transferring responsibility for the police or the benefits system. Our Wales Political Editor Nick Servini reports. The village of Pontrhydyfen near Port Talbot. As well as the birthplace of Richard Burton, this beauty spot was an industrial heartland and there are fears that clocks could be turned back as an application for fracking is considered. Today’s announcement means powers over this will be decided down the road in Cardiff in future, rather than at Westminster. Being Welsh themselves, they know of the difficulties that we have within the Valleys and therefore I feel they should have the ultimate control as opposed to those up in London. Pitch-side at the Millennium Stadium. David Cameron and Nick Clegg set out their game plan for devolution. This is devolution with a purpose, an enduring settlement for Wales, which works for Wales. Today, tomorrow and generations to come. So what is going to be devolved is for the first time control over major energy projects. Also 16 and 17-year-olds will be given the vote in assembly elections. And the assembly will be able to set its own speed limits on Welsh roads. What was not agreed on were major issues like policing, criminal justice and welfare. The first one we want it to go right. Earlier the Prime Minister was that the Royal Mint, just outside Cardiff. It was fitting because money will be at the heart of whether these powers are accepted by the other parties. We have no timetable in terms of when steps will be taken to address the under-funding, how much money is involved and by when. Plaid Cymru has been consistent in calling for parity for Wales with Scotland in terms of powers and in terms of finance. This was a great opportunity to take Wales’s devolution settlement closer to that of the other devolved nations. The UK Government accepts these powers are nothing like as extensive as those being devolved to Scotland. But they insist they are in tune with the wishes of the Welsh public. Nick Servini, BBC News, Cardiff. The UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, has told the party’s spring conference in Margate that he fears the election campaign will be notjust the longest but the most negative too. He said the British public was already fed up with the policy announcements being made every day by other party leaders. The actor Leonard Nimoy known as Spock in Star Trek has died at the age of 83. He had a long career as a stage and screen actor but made his name as the pointy eared half alien. jon Brain looks back at his life. What do you call those? I call them years. Few actors have had their entire careers so closely defined by a single role. You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship. Leonard Nimoy found his theatrical calling as Spock, Star Trek’s half Vulcan science officer. At times he even thought like him. In a given situation I might hear a voice that says, do you really think this is the approach you want to take to this problem? Maybe you are right, maybe I should rethink this. That rational voice of Mr Spock. His character was the only one to survive from the original pilot episode. Track. Before that, Nimoy had struggled to make a breakthrough. Zombies of the stratosphere of which he played a Martian was an early flop. Spock brought steady work and even lead to a singing career. He recorded seven albums. He also turned his hand to directing. Three men and a baby was a huge box office success. Do yourself a favour, but the psychological. But Spock was ever present and in his final screen role, there was only one way Leonard Nimoy was ever going to bid farewell. I shall simply say, good luck. The actor Leonard Nimoy, whose death was announced today. Now look at this dress - if you haven’t studied it already today. Is it black and blue - or is it white and gold? Some people SOITIE people SEE see it in these colours. Among those who weighed into the debate, justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. Why do different people see it in different colours? David Sillito reports. It is simply a photo of address and theissue It is simply a photo of address and the issue is, what colour is it? It is obvious, white and gold. No? One question, simple. Oh my God, somebody sent me that. We have seen this. What colour is it? It is blue. I see white and gold. No way! It is gold and white? Gold and white. White and gold, that is what I see anyway. No wait, that is black and blue. It was notjust anyway. No wait, that is black and blue. It was not just this street talking about it, this map social media across the world, the white areas are people discussing this photo of a dress of a wedding posted last week. It is strange, especially seeing what people are making about it on twitter, who is reposting it, what they are saying, it is mad. What colour is it really? The answer is here. It is very definitely back and blue, isn’t it? However, let’s hold it up against the white. But extra light on it, change the exposure, change the colour balance and that is starting to look a bit gold and white. Taylor Swift is just confused. Taylor Swift isjust confused. Why? The rods and cones, receptors in our eyes for shape and colour, very.

After a rent battle fought with celebrity backing tenants are being asked to pay according to their income. A Catholic priest has been found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage boy at a children’s home in West London. Father Anthony McSweeney, abused the teenager while working at Grafton Close Children’s Home in Hounslow over 30 years ago. We can get more details now from Emma North who’s at Southwark Crown Court. Emma. Father Anthony McSweeney worked as a part-time Catholic priest at the boys home between 1979 and 1981. He had a reputation of being touchy-feely with the boys. He was given the job by our friend. The peer of them had a reputation for abusing as a peer. The other person was found dead last month. They two men apparently went to the Netherlands and watched child pornography. And a cleaner found a draw with child pornography and went to the Catholic Church, but the court was told that was ignored. He was found guilty today of one charge of abusing a teenage boy. He was cleared of the charges. Did the judge say anything about what the sentence could be? Father Anthony McSweeney was released on bail today that he was told he should expect to go to prison. The judge said he should not come to court thinking that because he got bail he would not go to prison. The police who investigated paid tribute to the bravery of the victim. Father Anthony McSweeney will be backin Father Anthony McSweeney will be back in court at the end of March when he will be sentenced.

From Monday it will be illegal to drive if you have taken drugs such as cannabis and cocaine over a specified limit. There will be a one-year driving ban or a to one yearin one-year driving ban or a to one year injailfor one-year driving ban or a to one year injail for those who one-year driving ban or a to one year in jail for those who are caught. Experts see the law should make a difference. You need to show that the impairment was due to whatever substance was found in the blood and that is often difficult to prove. The new law makes it easier to prosecute people who have specific drugs in the system. Some prescription drugs will also be included but the limits will be set higher. There have been times when we have nearly all fallen apart. But we have stuck together. It is a lasting legacy. City of London police are warning pedestrians to be more vigilant when using their mobiles. It comes after CCTV filmed a cyclist grabbing a phone from the hand of a lI1-year-old man. The theft occurred last month in Fetter Lane. Officers say the number of such thefts in the City is increasing, with one every two days since December. You have got to think about use of endings. The mobile phone as a commodity. Boris Bikes are turning from blue to red. It’s not a comment on their political allegiance ahead of the election - instead it’s a reflection on their sponsor. It’s changing from Barclays to another banking giant, Santander. But will the new sponsorship deal be good for London? Here’s Karl Mercer. With another photo opportunity and another wave, the Mayor launched the next stage of London’s cycle hire scheme. It is out with the blue of Barclays and in with the red of rival bank Santander. the blue light read. It has no political significance. It is great news for cycling in London. We are proud of the popularity of the scheme. But you have to cut costs as much as you can. This is to be welcomed. money will only be for the cycle hire scheme, not, as with Barclays, for the cycle superhighways too. They will lose their blue colouring. We think it is very relevant. It is part and parcel of the community. The deal will mean Londoners paying £3 million a year less in subsidy for the cycle hire scheme. Santander will stump up around £7 million a year until 2022, 2 million more than their predecessors. With Barclays there was a shortfall in the cost sought the taxpayers had to pay that shortfall. With this deal it is less money that the taxpayer has to pay and it gives an image of a bag killing about the community. The previous Barclays deal was much criticised with the bank eventually pulling out of a deal to sponsor the bikes for another three years. Even the Mayor’s opponents think things seem better this time around. This is a better deal. The previous deal was disastrous. This looks like there is more money. And there is a commitment to promoting cycling in London. The first new bikes will be rolled out next week. The whole fleet will be red by the summer. They fought a high-profile battle for cheaper rent with the celebrity backing of comedian Russell Brand. Well, now the residents of the New Era estate in Hoxton are being asked to pay according to what they earn. That could mean wealthier tenants paying more to subsidise the rent of poorer neighbours. Marc Ashdown has been finding out how they feel about it. Last year these residents were helped by Russell Brand to see off new owners who wanted to triple their rents. A housing charity bot the property and reversed the decision. But there is still a problem. Rents are half of the going rate for the area. These buildings have seen better days. They need repairs and maintenance. Who is going to pay? The charity wants the better off to foot most of the bill. And this is how the rents baked lead upwards. This chart shows the rent in blue. Low earners would have rent reduced. Those at the top end with half the rent doubled. They see it as a theatre system. We need to identify this zone of affordability. If you are earning a bigger salary you will be a bigger rent. That means one person being happy to go with out with their neighbour being less, potentially with a beggar flat. being less, potentially with a beggarflat. It beggar flat. It could cause tension. We do not want a good community to be destroyed. If it works on this estate Y it’s not work for other States? -- works on this estate Y it’s not work for other States? -- why should it not work? All this relies on a form of altruism really seen in this consumer society. COI’ISUITIâI’ society. Still consumer society. Still to come before the end of the programme.

If you are a Chelsea supporters you want to put a message that says hash tag Chelsea, for Spurs C # Spurs. Let us talk about the game itself. It will be a big game for both sides. They have met twice before on this turf. It has been a better story if you are a Tottenham supporter. Let us walk down memory lane. 1967 and the old Wembley might have had a bigger capacity for supporters. We went up at eight o’clock on the Saturday morning to see if we could get tickets. We managed to get two tickets. He’s paid more for those tickets than his weekly wage. The ticket cost was priceless as Tottenham defeated Chelsea 2-0 to lift the FA Cup. And in this household the Tottenham Hotspur tradition lives on. By 2008 the household was back at Wembley for another cup final. Another effectively for another generation. Hopefully they will bring his son up. It means a lot, passing it on. We go to all the games. Sunday will be special. We will give them a run for their money. Ido not think they will be afraid of Chelsea. The Tottenham supporters are in a positive mood, but those interviews were done before they crashed out of the Europa League last night. I am in the Chelsea end. And now we will head into the Chelsea camp. Chelsea have won this competition for times previously, twice under their current manager. It is a big London derby. It means a lot to the supporters and the players. It is one of game. They are capable of beating as. Being in finals is what it is all about. We are delighted to be year. Our final is up by now. It does not matter who is the opponents. I have not yet won this competition. It is a massive occasion. A final is a final. We have a final to win on Sunday. There is fool, to the on BBC London -- there is complete, Tilly on BBC London radio. Congratulations have to go. We should also say congratulations to another Saracens full- back. She starts for the England women’s team tonight. I have been given permission to lift the trophy. Good luck to Tottenham and Chelsea on Sunday. I am going to run away with this. We’re exactly two weeks away from Comic Relief 2015 and not only can you already buy your red noses, but you can also start raising, or giving, money to people like comedian Mark Watson. He’s working very hard for your donations by fronting a 27 hour show in North London. Concerned that he might not be in a fit state to speak by the end of it, Wendy Hurrell decided to go and meet him now. We are at a theatre in Islington. In the next couple of hours of comedy marathon will begin. For the next 27 hours this man will be on stage. How had he been preparing? I have been asleep. I have been preparing as if it was an actual marathon. He did a 25 hours sure a couple of years back so he has a strategy. Quite a number of comedians are coming in to do that. If anyone comes in the might think they are ppppips comes in the might think they are popping in, but they will emerge 15 hours later. Mark Watson has a doppelgangers. The man on the right will be Mark Watson while Mark Watson is on stage. Last time the tasks included book signings. He gave me a copy of his signature on a plate. I had to position the plate in front of me. I copied the signature uproariously onto all the books. We will be sitting in a bath of beans. They have been advised to where wet suits to guard against hypothermia. No one really thinks about the dangers involved. We are going to prove that it is not easy. They and the rest of the fundraising audience want your sponsorship. To join in watch live online or go to the Comic Relief website. Here is the weather. A cloudy day tomorrow. The chance of rain in the morning. Clients coming in from the West. That continues this evening and overnight. The main feature of the overnight period is that it will not be as cold as it was last mate. -- last night. Most of the rain clears away in the afternoon. Still some fog in the afternoon. Things go downhill through the evening. There is a big blow to the North and West. Wet and windy weather through the evening. Most of the rain clears away through the small hours of Sunday. It will feel cold on Sunday. Strong winds. Quite a plaster the look into the early part of next week. And Anne settled look to the early part of March. -- and I’ve settled look. And I cold feel to things. Before we go this Friday evening, a reminder of tonight’s main news headlines. Labour says it’ll cut university tuition fees in England to £6,000 a year if it wins the general election. It claims the change could be introduced this Autumn. David Cameron has promised that Britain will use all means at its disposal to hunt down militants such as the West London graduate known as jihadi john. The security services are facing questions about their contacts with Mohammed Emwazi. Gary Glitter has been sentenced to 16 years in jail for sexually abusing three young girls when he was at the height of his fame. Glitter- whose real name is Paul Gadd - was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court. That’s it. I’ll be back later during the Ten o’clock News on BBC One, but for now, from everyone on the team have a very good evening.

He was a pupil at a Church of England primary school in north London. And his secondary school teacher says the man now notorious for appearing in horrific IS videos attended anger management therapy. The Prime Minister has defended the security services who spoke several times tojihadi john before he left for Syria. Also tonight. Labour announces plans to cut tuition fees by a third - from £9000 a year to £6000. Let me just say this directly to Britain’s young people. I made you a promise on tuition fees. I will keep my promise. No letup in the fighting in parts of Eastern Ukraine - even as government forces pull back under the terms of the ceasefire. Roaring ahead - how India’s set to overtake China as the world’s fastest growing large economy. What do you call those? I call them ears. And Leonard Nimoy - known to millions as Spock, the pointy-eared half Vulcan on Star Trek - has died at the age of 83. Tonight on BBC London: The priest found guilty of sexually abusing a teenager at a children’s home in Hounslow. And tenants involved in a recent housing battle could now be means tested to decide how much rent to pay. Good evening. The Prime Minister has defended the work of the security services, after it emerged that the Islamic State extremist known as jihadi john managed to leave the UK for Syria despite being questioned several times by British intelligence. Mohammed Emwazi - his real name - attended secondary school in north London. A teacher at Ouintin Kynaston Community Academy has told the BBC Emwazi was referred to anger management therapy when he was a pupil there. Our special correspondent Lucy Manning has more. A sweet smile, shining eyes, yet this young schoolboy Mohammed Emwazi, but some years later only show his menacing eyes through the slip of a balaclava, asjihadi john. Today, your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Yet at his primary School in West London, a ten-year-old like any other, his hobbies football and computer games. His school yearbook says his favourite book was how to kill a monster. No one could predict he would turn into a monster who killed. At his former high school, one of his teachers, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was initially a shy boy, but one who needed anger management. He used to get into fights, but not a huge amount. He’d get very angry and worked up and it would take him a long time to calm down so we did a lot of work as a school to help him with his anger and to control his emotions. It seemed to work. Those who prayed with him near the family’s home say he was a strict Muslim and never thought he would get involved in terrorism. He was quite a happy guy, I thought he would get a job, nothing like this. I never thought he would be a jihadi. Forthe I never thought he would be a jihadi. For the families of the murdered hostages, the mother of james Foley can’t believe a clever London boy grew intojihadi john. He had the benefit of a comfortable upbringing, yet he’s using his gifts and talents for such hatred and brutality. How Mohammed Emwazi turned from a pupil at this primary school to de-radicalised murderer in Syria still isn’t clear. What is clear is that the so-called Islamic State weren’t the first to recruit him. MI5 tried six years ago, and now growing questions about what it and the police knew. But those involved in intelligence to deny MI5 approaches to Mohammed Emwazi had marred -- approaches to Mohammed Emwazi had marred -- radicalised him. Brian approached you give the individual an opportunity to draw back from the terrorist groups, usually at Swahili, sometimes she, he is about to mix with, and you give them a warning. The idea that somehow being spoken to by a member of MI5 is a radicalising act, I think this is very false. But with hundreds of Britons fighting in Syria, the Prime Minister defended MI5 and MI6 and promised to hand the hostage colours. We will do everything we can with the police, security services and everything we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action. The fear is the increasing number of British schoolboys who grow up and become radicalised. Labour has announced it would cut university tuition fees in England to £6000 per year from autumn 2016. Ed Miliband says the reduction in the current fee of £9000 would be paid for by reducing tax relief on pension contributions for higher earners. Public finance experts say graduates who go on to high-paid jobs will benefit most. Our education editor Branwen jeffreys reports. Universities are booming, despite fees of £9,000 a year. There are more students and more from poorer backgrounds, but today, Ed Miliband said the current system was broken and Labour’s plan would fix it. Let me say this directly to Britain’s young people. I made you a promise on tuition fees. I will keep my promise. I don’t want to simply build yourfaith in Labour, I want to restore your faith in change that can be believed and that is what the next Labour government will offer. APPLAUSE At the moment students pay back tuition fees over 30 years. Those on higher salaries pay off the full £9000 a year with interest. Those on lower salaries pay less, with outstanding debts written off. Under Labour’s plans, richer graduates would pay less and poorer graduates would be unaffected. Isn’t itjust a better future for bankers, lawyers, doctors, the people who are going to be earning most and who will benefit most from this? I don’t believe that, no, because every young person who goes to university is thinking about this issue of debt. We are also increasing the grant for our young people as well. £1+00 increase in the grant to make a difference to them, to make a difference to their living costs, so that’s why it’s better for students, better for the universities and betterfor Britain. How much do you think it costs to keep a student away from home for a year nowadays? It costs a significant amount of money, I’m not going to plug a figure out of the air. I know lots of young people are facing real hardship and it’s really hard times for young people. Universities have been promised that any money lost from tuition fees will be replaced, but they are uneasy about the details of how that would work. Labour says they’ll find the money by reducing tax relief on pension contributions of the highest earners. This is a tax rise on pensions of about £3 billion a year. That’s pretty substantial. It’s less than the total you get from for example Ip on the basic rate of income tax, but in the context of some of the smaller changes we’ve seen in recent years it’s pretty substantial. If you talk to students, as I did at Sussex, not all are impressed by reducing tuition debt. Actually the problem on the ground is not how much we pay for tuition fees because we get that as a loan and we never see it, we pay it off, but the maintenance loan is something that really needs to be looked at. They need to take a leaf out of the Green Party’s book and say we’ll make it free, because it will win them the votes they want. Labour says their plans are more sustainable in the long term. The Lib Dems argue they are financially literate and the Conservatives say they are bad for taxpayers, universities and students. We can talk to our political correspondent Carole Walker, who’s at Westminster. Ed Miliband has decided to make this a very personal pledge despite some opposition from within his own party. Yes, it’s been a pretty tortuous process. He had battled with his shadowed chance Lacombe Ed Balls, over how to pay for it, and some in his party don’t think it’s is the right priority on which to make such a big commitment. This is a personal mission for Ed Miliband to address that situation whereby many young people are going to be worse off than their parents and grandparents. The Tories have been critical. They say it will bring chaos to a system already seeing more poorer students going to universities. Some of the strongest criticism have come from Lib Dems, who famously opposed to rising tuition fees. They now say it will be a mistake to put them because those who will benefit are the wealthier graduates who get well-paid jobs, that will have lower loans to pay back. But Ed Miliband made the promise direct to camera. He said it will be a red line in any coalition negotiations. He knows if he doesn’t keep that promise, he will pay a heavy political price. The former singer, Gary Glitter, has beenjailed for 16 years for sexually abusing three young girls between 1975 and 1980. The judge at Southwark Crown Court told Glitter- who was tried under his real name Paul Gadd - that it was ""difficult to overstate the depravity"" of his behaviour. Sarah Campbell was in court. There’s some flash photography in her report. It’s almost Ao years since this man attempted to rape an eight-year-old girl. Today, justice finally caught up with him. In the dock he showed little reaction as the sentence was passed, just a shake of his head, as he listened to the impact his actions have had on the three girls he abused. One of his victims was in court to hearjudge Alistair McCreath tell Glitter, ""You did all of them real and lasting damage and you did so for no other reason than to obtain sexual gratification for yourself of a wholly improper kind."" Glitter had managed to keep his abusive nature a secret for decades. His lyrics were suggestive, his performances sexual. This documentary was filmed a year after we now know he assaulted a 13-year-old fan. I feel it’s like a love affair. It’s a love affair that you have with your audience. In 1997, employees at this Bristol store were the first to discover who he really was, when they found images showing child abuse on his hard drive. He wasjailed for two months, and then again in Vietnam in 2006, for abusing two pre-teenage girls. These crimes leave the victim with a life sentence of what was done to them. So I think that people who commit such crimes should not expect any leniency. Back injail for a third time, Glitter will be almost 79 years old before he can even be considered for release. A chief executive at a hospital where jimmy Savile serially abused patients told a local MP two years ago that the entertainer had not been given free access to clinical areas. A report yesterday found Savile had been given open access to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where he raped or assaulted at least 63 patients, staff and visitors. Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said the information provided had been accurate at the time. Ukraine says its forces have begun pulling back heavy weapons from the front line in the east of the country - under the terms of a ceasefire agreed with pro-Russian rebels two weeks ago. But in pockets of eastern Ukraine the fighting appears to be continuing unabated, with civilians caught in the middle. Paul Wood and cameraman Moose Campbell report on the battle for Donetsk. There is a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine. Not that you would know it here. This shattered village is held by the government. It is the front line in a battle with pro-Russian rebels for control of Donetsk airport. These men are from a nationalist militia. Not the regular army. Their presence on such a vital front is a sign of the government’s weakness. They say it is only a matter of time before the ceasefire breaks down completely. ""A political solution isn’t possible,"" he says. ""This war didn’t start today. ""The Russians have always tried to crush Ukraine. ""Look at history. ""They caused a famine and now they are trying to take our land"". The militia men complain bitterly about their own leadership. This war is not going well for a Ukrainian side outgunned by the rebels. ""Look at this weapon"", he says. ""It has bullets from 1943. ""But we don’t have a lack of troops, just lack of brains ""of those who command the troops"". Ukrainian forces have suffered some disastrous setbacks. But with the truce, the front lines are static and they are using that as an opportunity to regroup and prepare for the next round of hostilities. Another big Ukrainian defeat could be the trigger for the US to step in to arm the government. That prospect is deeply alarming on the other side of this front line, in the pro-Russian enclaves. In the village of Alexandrovka, locals show us the remains of a cluster bomb. Government forces shell indiscriminately, they say. ""We are all Ukrainian"", she tells me. ""So why do they kill our children? ""We spent the whole summer in our cellars. ""We know who is shelling us and it is not the rebels"". The village used to be split between support for Kiev and Moscow, they say. Now, under shelling and reliant on the International Red Cross for food, they tell us everyone supports the rebels. With each round of fighting, attitudes harden, and the chances of peace slip further and further away. PaulWood, BBC News, Donetsk. India is forecast to overtake China to become the world’s fastest-growing large economy next year. But Prime Minister Modi faces serious challenges as he prepares to deliver his first budget this weekend. GDP is expected to grow by more than 8% percent in the coming year, a figure European economies can only dream of. But nine out of ten people in India don’t have a formaljob. And with a million people joining the labour market each month, analysts say creating meaningful work will require radical reforms to the economy. justin Rowlatt reports from Delhi. The distinctive thump of the single cylinder engines of Royal Enfield motorbikes are set to return to Britain’s streets. The Indian company that makes this once British classic has big plans for expansion. We now expect to become a globalfirm. And the nerve centre of this global firm is going to be in our engineering centre in the UK. We are hiring engineers, opening a lot of stores in the UK. It is the success of specialist businesses like Royal Enfield that explains why the World Bank is predicting that pretty soon India will overtake China to become the fastest-growing large economy in the world. But there is a problem. India may excel in some specialist industries, but many of these don’t employ that many people. The government’s great challenge is how to create more work. Nine out of ten Indians don’t even have a formaljob. 1.25 billion potential customers should be a huge asset for a country, a great demographic dividend. Take mobile phones. 7 million new smartphones are sold every month, and the most popular are made by an Indian company, Micromax. Their basic smartphone starts atjust EA5. The problem is, many Indian businesses still find it is cheaper to manufacture key components in China. The whole sourcing still comes from China, and the ecosystem of companies does not exist in India to the level that you can truly manufacture and get the benefits of scale. The stakes are high. If Mr Modi’s government fails to grow the economy and create more jobs, India’s so-called demographic dividend could easily become a demographic disaster, with hundreds of millions of people remaining trapped in poverty. But getting India on the road to continued success, reshaping the nation’s economy, will require deep and radical reform. The country will be looking to tomorrow’s budget for evidence that Mr Modi is resolute enough to do what it takes. justin Rowlatt, BBC News, Delhi. Some newsjust in. Boris Nemtsov, the Russian opposition politician and a vocal critic of Vladimir Putin, has been shot dead on the streets of Moscow. Local reports say Mr Nemtsov was shot four times. Police are attending the scene, close to the Kremlin. Police in Bangladesh are investigating the murder of an American blogger who was hacked to death in the capital, Dhaka. Avijet Roy had been a vocal critic of religious extremism. His family say he’d been threatened by Islamist radicals in recent weeks. David Cameron has set out new devolved powers for Wales, including control over energy projects such as fracking. But there was no agreement on transferring responsibility for the police or benefits system. And the offer of a referendum on handing income tax powers to the Welsh government was rejected by the First Minister of Wales. As part of his first official visit to japan, the Duke of Cambridge has paid tribute to British and Commonwealth soldiers who died in the Second World War. Prince William laid a wreath at a cemetery near Tokyo, where more than 1500 Commonwealth servicemen are buried. It was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 but today Lloyds took another step on the road to a full recovery. It paid a dividend to millions of shareholders for the first time in seven years. And the company announced annual profits of £1.8 billion. But there was controversy over staff bonuses of almost £370 million. Kamal Ahmed has more. The black horse of Lloyds, a symbol of one of the UK’s oldest banks and a byword for dependable service. Well, until 2008 when it went from black to red after the calamities of the financial crisis when it almost collapsed and was partly nationalised. Finally, after six years, it looks like it is back on track. I met the chief executive and asked him how the bank had been turned around. I focused the bank on the UK, on households, on lending to SMEs. We were the bank that most supported first-time buyers. We are the largest bank in the communities. And I have completely refocused the bank on Britain, to help Britain prosper. Lloyds is a bank on the mend. In 2008 the government took a 40% stake as part of the bank’s bail out. Since then, it has sold toxic assets and reduced the number of countries it operates in from 30 to eight. The share price has increased by 191% since 2012. Gilbert Wright and his wife are two of the 3 million Lloyds shareholders who used to receive a major annual pay-out from the bank’s dividend. That stopped abruptly went the bank nearly went bust. We used to rely on £10,000 a year dividends. The dividend we are getting now from today’s announcement is £750. It is a start but it is a long way short of 10,000. Lloyds used to be in the doghouse but now it has rebuilt itself, offering bread-and-butter services in branches like this one, opening people’s accounts, supporting mortgages and financing new businesses. The man at the top of the organisation has certainly been well rewarded for that success. Well rewarded to the tune of £11 million, the value of Mr Horta Osorio’s pay package for 2014. The government agreed performance targets three years ago, and the bank hit 96% of them. Some suggested that showed they weren’t challenging enough. The success of Lloyds bank has been reflected today in the pay that you will receive. Is anyone worth £11 million? Well, it’s not up to me to judge that. What I think is important for each person is to... I understand that people may be focused on pay, but I would expect and hope that they focus on pay for performance. The sun might be shining now for Lloyds but there are still shadows, such as the huge payment for the mis-selling of insurance products. Lloyds may be a better bank but it’s not perfect. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. Now as the man might have said of himself, he lived long and prospered, but the actor Leonard Nimoy, known around the world as Spock in the popular long running sci-fi series Star Trek, has died at the age of 83. David Sillito looks back on his career. Fascinating. What do you call those? I call them ears. I fail to see what they find so amusing. He did play other roles, but essentially, Leonard Nimoy was Spock. You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship. You pointy-eared hobgoblin. Hit me. Harder. Star Trek’s half Vulcan science officer was more thanjust a role. HE WGS B pI’âSâI’ICâ. In a given situation I might hear a voice that says, ""Do you really think that this is the approach you want to take to this problem""? I think, ""Oh, maybe you are right, maybe I should rethink this"". And that rational voice is the voice of Spock. Spock was one of the only characters to survive the original pilot episode, and it was a lucky break. Check the circuits. All operating, sir. Before that, Leonard Nimoy had struggled. Zombies of The Stratosphere, that is him as the pilot of a Martian spaceship, was remarkable only for how cheap it was to make. Spock brought steady work, and for an actor who had grown up in an Orthodox jewish family in Catholic Boston, he said he knew what it felt like to be an outsider. # In the middle of the Earth in the land of Shire # Lives a brave little hobbit whom we alladmire... # And he rode a tide of Spock-mania that even led to a singing career. He recorded seven albums. Sherlock Holmes, Mission Impossible, it wasn’tjust Star Trek. I didn’t hear anything. A slight rumbling. But it did define his career. President Obama, who himself has been compared to Spock, paid tribute. ""Long before nerdy was cool"", he said, ""there was Leonard Nimoy"". Do yourself a favour, put aside logic. And William Shatner, Captainjames T Kirk, said, ""I loved him like a brother. ""We will all miss his humour, his capacity to love"". Since my customary farewell would appear oddly self-serving, I shall simply say, good luck. Leonard Nimoy, whose death was announced today. That’s all from us. Now the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The government has been told it was wrong to relax the law designed to deal with terror suspects. The criticism comes as the identity ofjihadi john was revealed to be an ex-student from west London, Mohammed Emwazi.

But this time he’s the world’s most wanted. In his old haunts the quest for clues to Mohammed Emwazi’s descent into Islamic extremism.

He speaks from experience. He turned from A grade student to Islamist extremist. Is something that allows 1000 British-born and raised Muslim teenagers tojoin Isil, it’s an atmosphere that is continually producing notjust Mohammed Emwazi but the three teenage girls who went last week to join them and hundreds of others. The Mayor wants more surveillance. We need to keep a very close eye on these people and the decision to modify the control orders, to water them down, I think in retrospect looks as though it was a mistake. Control orders were phased out in 2012. They lasted 12 months. The suspect was not allowed a valid passport, mobile phone or Internet access, and could be electronically tagged, relocated to another town with a 16 hour curfew. Criticised for being unfair, MI5 and the police were forced to introduce less restrictive measures, so-called TPIMs. The government’s independent security adviser warns they may not be working. Ministers, police and intelligence agencies lost faith in TPIMs, which didn’t allow them to relocate people away from their home towns. If you can’t do that it’s easier for them to continue their bad associations and it’s easier for them to escape. But if the authorities had wanted to place Emwazi on a control order or TPIM, they could have done. They may not have had enough evidence. Suggesting the battle against radicalisation cannot be left to politicians and spooks alone.

A Catholic priest has been found guilty of sexually abusing a teenage boy at a children’s home in Hounslow. Father Anthony McSweeney committed the crimes over 30 years ago. Our reporter, Emma North has more on the case. McSweeney was employed as a part-time Catholic police at the Grafton Close home for boys between 1979 and 1981. He had a nickname, the fact the car, and had a reputation among the residents of being very touchy-feely with the boys. -- being very touchy-feely with the boys. -- he was the fact they go. His close friend john Stingemore man often close and was facing charges of sexually abusing teenage boys, but his body was found injanuary, so that trial never took place. It is understood these two men worked as a team, watching child pawn together, including a film of a ten-year-old boy being abused. When a cleaner found a draw of child pornography she contacted the Catholic church and the court was told the Catholic Church simply ignored her. Father McSweeney said he couldn’t possibly have been an abuser. He denied all the charges. He said he was too fat. Did the punishment sake -- He said he was too fat. Did the punishment sake -- did thejudge say anything about the punishment? The judge said he would was likely to be injail when judge said he would was likely to be injailwhen he was judge said he would was likely to be injail when he was sentenced at the end of March. Police have paid tribute to the bravery of those who testified against him. Wealthier tenants on a housing estate in east London could be charged more to live in the same block as poorer ones. There are plans to means test residents on the New Era estate in Hoxton - which could lead to some rents falling, and others doubling. Here’s Marc Ashdown. Last year, New Era residents became something of a cause celebre. Russell Brand helped them see off new US owners who wanted to triple their rents. A housing charity then bought the 93 flat estate and reversed the decision. So the residents’ uprising won the day, but they still have a problem. You see, rents here are very cheap, about half the going rate for the area and these buildings, they’ve seen better days. They urgently need repairs and maintenance. The question now, who’s going to pay? The charity wants the better off to foot most of the bill. This is a projection of how their rent might gently rise upwards as their income increases. This chart shows the rent in blue, low earners on say £20,000 would have a rent cut, while someone on £66,000 at the top end would have their rent doubled. The red shows disposable income after bills and shopping in green, a much fairer system, they say. We need to identify this kind of zone of affordability, how much rent can people reasonably afford to pay. Clearly that means if you’re learning a lot, a bigger salary, yes, you will pay a bigger rent. Of course that means one person being happy to go without so then another can pay less, potentially with a bigger flat. Residents had a meeting last night and are broadly open to the idea but were concerned. The problem is it causes tension and the last thing we want is a really good community to be destroyed and to be taken to pieces because people feel resentful about people paying higher rents. It may set a precedent, if everybody is happy with it, why couldn’t it work for other estates? It’s only fair people who are working class are able to stay in London. The charity says it will keep liaising with residents to find a solution, no doubt aware of what happened when the last owners crossed them. All this relies on a form of altruism rarely seen in this consumer society, a sort of love thy neighbour. just how much? That’s it for now from me, but let’s find out what the weather’s up to with Helen Willetts. The sunny, cloudless weather will not be repeated over the weekend. Some rain is on its way in for the night. Another spell of wet, windy weather through tomorrow night. It will be bright on Sunday, but getting colder. We have this weather system approaching tonight. Most of us should stay dry until dawn. Fog over the hills. us should stay dry until dawn. Fog overthe hills. Not over the hills. Not especially cold. Some damp weather first thing, not the best start to the weekend. Hopefully the afternoon will be drier. It won’t be too cold. 9-10 Celsius. It was a lovely day today. Tomorrow night, wet and windy weather sweeps across. We may her Wâ8li’IâI’ SWEEPS BCFOSS. WE may i’IâIâ yOUIâ weather sweeps across. We may her your roof rattling and fences over. A brighter, showery day on Sunday. Starting to get colder as we move into the beginning of next week. Darren will have more for you on the Outlook. There it is. Hello there. It looks like March will start cold with increasingly wintry showers. Before then, the last day of February is more likely to be cloudy, some rain or drizzle. The wetter weather arrives on Saturday night. With that, the potential for damaging winds, before the colder, showery air on Sunday with some sunshine. Today, the gap in the cloud is being forced away. Cloud is invading from the Atlantic, bringing rain and drizzle. Keeping the temperature is up. By the end of the night, a milder night for all of us than last night. Tomorrow will start off rather grey and gloomy. Misty and murky, particularly across England and Wales, and rather damp. So improvements across the south-east. Sunshine will be limited. More wet and windy weather coming into the West in the afternoon. It turns wet and windy across the south-west of England and Wales late afternoon. Most of the afternoon, the Midlands and South East should be dry. It will be miles, 10-11 C. Not as miles further north, we see the wind and rain pushing into Northern Ireland in the afternoon, but into western Scotland. The best of the sunshine in north-east Scotland and to the east of the Pennines. We will all get the Borini -- we will all get the rain in the evening and overnight. It’s driven by the deep area of low pressure. Notice the isobars. It will be windy. Gusts of 60 miles an hour or more in Northern Ireland, transferring into central and southern Scotland and the far north of England in the early hours of the morning. These areas have the potential for travel disruption and maybe power disruption. The worst of the wins Whistler way into the North Sea and it will be a blustery day. Showers in the north turning wintry. A good deal of sunshine before a shot burst of rain runs across more southern areas in the afternoon. Gradually through the day it will feel colder and colder. Notice the rain in the south. It’s driven by the jet stream. We could see more rain because the jet stream is a long way south. Early next week we ",,
162,BBC1 London,23-feb-2015,Joins BBC News,01:55,245 mins,True,"there’s a chance you might get one or two showers. So that’s this week. How about into next weekend? The weather’s going to go up and down the hill. We’ll have shots of cold air, then there’s going to be a spell of milder air heading our way during the course of Saturday. And then out in the North Atlantic, we’ve got another spell of colder weather coming our way. That’s basically various weather systems heading our way bringing us unsettled weather. So changeable is the most important word to remember. Windy with that, spells of rain and with those shots of cold air, at times we’ll see wintry showers, particularly in the Northwest. That’s it, good night. Hello there, after a wet and windy Sunday, it will be windy on Monday. And it will feel cold. But most of us should see some sunshine between the wintry showers, of which there will be plenty. Low pressure in charge and the winds are strong. Those strong winds actually help to keep temperatures in most towns and cities above freezing first thing. But it will feel cold this Monday morning. Plenty of sunshine showers working into Scotland. About 200 metres, but it could hit low levels. Across England and Wales, many places. The working week will start with sunshine. But it will feel bitter. There will be some showers across central and southern parts of England and Wales, snow over the tops of the hills and mountains, at lower levels, you might see sleet or get one or two hail showers. They will keep coming through the day. Yes, there will be spells of sunshine, quite a lot through â8Stâiâi’l BFEBS, but there will be a blustery wind throwing showers across all areas. Temperatures will reach five to eight degrees, but don’t forget that wind. It will make it feel much colder. It will feel about freezing in most places because of the icy wind, which continues to blow on Monday evening, if you are going out. Showers may fade in some areas, but keep going in Scotland and Northern Ireland, snow on the hills. Showers return later in the night, across more southern parts of the UK. Why so windy and wintry? Low pressure dominates. That low slowly pulls away on Tuesday. A lot of isobars still on the chart, so blustery, but as it goes, showers will fade. Tuesday afternoon offers more sunshine and fewer showers. There will still be some snow showers coming in across northern and western parts of Scotland and the hills. More snow showers to come. Temperatures a bit higher but still it will feel cold. There will be a bitter wind blowing. The low finally clears on Tuesday night, isobars open a little. That allows things to turn frosty before an approaching weather front brings in cloud and rain. In the east, a dry and bright day on Wednesday. After a frosty start, temperatures go up to seven or eight degrees. Temperatures further west could get up to nine or ten degrees, but there will be wet weather coming in. Through the week ahead, strong winds, often wet, and on Monday, feeling cold. Goodbye. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Ben Bland. Our top stories: Lights, camera action! The Oscars ceremony is under way. Who will be this year’s Academy Award winners? The first when it has been announced. -- winners. Two former British foreign secretaries are to be investigated following claims they arranged access to officials in exchange join Islamic State in Syria appeal And we take a trip to the Korean cafe getting touchy-feely in the Year of the Sheep. Hello - thank you forjoining us. The movie industry’s biggest night of the year is upon us. The 87th Academy Awards is under way. There are bound to be a few surprises - but it looks like the biggest awards may be shared between two big films. Those tipped to win our Birdman and Boyhood. They are not necessarily those with the most nominations -- are. Birdman equals the Grand Budapest Hotel having no nominations. The first of the awards have been announced. Let’s cross to the land of sunshine, or is it? The BBC’s Peter Bowes is in Hollywood. We wish it was the land of sunshine. It is the land of steady drizzle. That isn’t spoiling the fun. The Oscars are under way and we hope for a few surprises as the night goes on. The first award has been given out. It wasn’t a surprise. Everyone predicted this - IK out. It wasn’t a surprise. Everyone predicted this -]K Simmons has out. It wasn’t a surprise. Everyone predicted this - IK Simmons has won the award for best supporting actor for his role in whiplash, playing a brutal music teacher -- for his role in whiplash, playing a brutal music teacher -- Whiplash. All about his teaching of a young drummer in a band. It was predicted he would win this category. Lletget reaction. With me to analyse what happened is the chief film critic with the LA Weekly and Tom Brook. This wasn’t a surprise, was it? It wasn’t and he gave an excellent performance. I looked him up the other day and I found out he had done 74 film roles, he is 60, he does TV. You were telling me he is best known for insurance commercials. That’s right. He is familiar in the US because he fronts a commercial on TV for an insurance company. He works away and he tries to get the big roles. This was the big roles against-- role for to get the big roles. This was the big roles against -- role for him. It was. I think it was a one note role in a pretty fun film. I was hoping even Paul could pull it off. -- Ethan Hawke could pull it off. Everyone is happy for him. He is fond of saying he has made it big at the age of 60, an overnight success at the age of 60. No one will deny that. Another award handed out, best costume design, and that went to Grand Budapest Hotel. Well-deserved. It got an award for make-up and hair. Grand Budapest Hotel, one of mY hair. Grand Budapest Hotel, one of my favourite movies, will do very well in these craft awards. In some of the larger awards it won’t prevail. It could end up with four Oscar trophy. prevail. It could end up with four Oscartrophy. It Oscar trophy. It might end up with more awards. I would like that. If I could pick, Ithink more awards. I would like that. If I could pick, I think it should get best picture. There is plenty to debate. The biggest point since the Oscar nominations were announced is the lack of diversity in the nominations. No black faces, no black people nominated for best actor or Best Director. This is the second time it has happened in 20 years. Much comment on that. The canopy would like the industry to be more diverse however it is implied thatit more diverse however it is implied that it isn’t their fault -- more diverse however it is implied that it isn’t their fault -- the Academy. If you look at those arriving, it has been a diverse crowd who has thrown up. The academy has done all it can to invite people from different groups - has done all it can to invite people from different groups - ethnic groups - from different groups - ethnic groups - to have a broad range of people -- who has shown up. It is quite conservative. A survey came out in the LA difficult to get away from that reality. How do they change that nouse you have to bring in new people -- nouse you have to bring in new people -- how do you change that? It’s a difficult problem. This has become an issue. Selma, the film about civil rights, has been nominated for best picture however, it could have done better. It’s unusual to get that nomination and then none in the other major categories at all. You are the greatest of the year, however, we don’t care much about acting, direction or script - don’t care much about acting, direction or script - it is strange. It is hard to understand. Is it racism? Lack of familiarity, rather than over racism. There is definitely a problem which has to be addressed. It is an industry problem. And the Academy reflects that. Before we hand back, Neil Patrick Harris is the show, it started with song and dance and we all expected that tribute to movies, the moving pictures that defines the -- movies, the moving pictures that defines the -- our lives, what you think? We don’t want to be as mean as Stefan McCully. I give him kudos. This earlyjoke about how this is the night for the best and the whitest. That is quite appointed jab. It is early days. I don’t think he has found his groove. Let’s give him a couple more hours to see what happens. I haven’t been overly impressed although I liked the opening musical number, I thought it was very good. The Oscars haven’t been very mean. You can hear the sounds of the mean streets behind us in LA. Plenty of questions to be answered and we will keep you up-to-date. We haven’t reached the categories like rest actress and actor and at the end of the show, Best Picture. With me is Louise Hosie, the BBC’s social media producer. The Grand Budapest Hotel has won best costume design. Other costumes making the most noise on Twitter. Yes, the ceremony is under way and Twitter has exploded. Some of the # is include # Oscars, re- tweeted more than 500 times -- is include # Oscars, re- tweeted more than 500 times -- hashtags. And Lady Gaga who is known to have a huge following on social media. Her outfit is coming under the spotlight. Lady Gaga Oscars 2015 is trending as a result. She isn’t even nominated for anything. Iust part of the performance. The outfits, you can see, the gloves she is wearing, people have taken to Twitter to say they look like rubber gloves, like washing-up gloves and they are tweeting photos of her. Yes, she is one of those who is talked about most nights. They look remarkably like a pair of washing-up gloves. Who else is talked about in terms of what they are wearing? The actress from 12 Years A Slave, Lepita, her dress is 6000 pearls went into the making of the dress. That’s getting quite a lot of attention. Patricia Arquette, who is up for Best Supporting Actress, her dress was made for her by one of her friends, Rosetta Getty. Other people we have seen on Twitter, FelicityIones, she is up for best actress, and Iulianne Moore as well, she is in Chanel tonight. It is notjust the obsession with dresses - tonight. It is notjust the obsession with dresses - that has come under the spotlight- obsession with dresses - that has come under the spotlight - there is another, # ask her more, encouraging actresses more thanjust another, # ask her more, encouraging actresses more than just what they are wearing. That’s right and Reese Witherspoon tweeted about this tonight, this # that has come up in terms of women not being asked all the time about what they are wearing. Reese Witherspoon has tweeted and said their so many talented nominees this year, let’s hear their stories and use the hashtag. We haven’t yet seen anything like the moment last year when Ellen Degeneres took that selfie with the stars, re- tweeted 3.5 million times of- we haven’t had a moment like that. We have had a big song and dance from Neil Patrick Harris at the start and everyone will have their eyes on him to see what he comes up with. He has promised to some magic in the ceremony. We will have to wait and see what tricks he has. What’s also interesting is some of the moments that might catch on, spontaneous things that we cannot predict like people falling or crying, those things, so, we will wait and watch. Thank you very much. And don’t forget you can go to our website for a closer look at the nominees - we’re live blogging the ceremony there and keeping you up to date with all the latest winners.

Iack Straw is heard talking about how he can operate under the radar and Malcolm Rifkind in another clip talks about how he can get access to British diplomats. This is a man who is a sitting MP who doesn’t get a salary. You would be surprised how much free time I have. I spend a lot of time reading. I spend a lot of time walking. Yeah. Because I am not a minister, or full-time working for one person, I can sort out my day. I am self-employed. Nobody pays me a salary. I have to earn my income.

Two former British foreign secretaries, Iack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, have been filmed in an undercover investigation apparently offering to use their positions and contacts to benefit clients in return for substantial payments. The families of three British teenage girls thought to have left the UK to join the so-called Islamic State in Syria have given emotional interviews asking their daughters to come home. Nothing’s been heard from Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase since they flew.to.Turkey fivedaysago.

Five days on, the girls were last seen at Gatwick Airport. A bomb explosion in north-eastern Nigeria has killed at least six people. The blast went off when security forces in the town of Potiskum tried to search a girl, possibly younger than 10 years old. Our correspondent in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, Will Ross has more details. Eyewitnesses say that a young girl was out at a security checkpoint near a market in Potiskum town. They say that she was wearing explosives, which were detonated. It is not clear if that was done remotely or evenif clear if that was done remotely or even if this girl was aware of what she was doing. Clearly, a scene of devastation with the dead and injured being seen to buy emergency services. This attack has not been claimed by the jihadist group, services. This attack has not been claimed by thejihadist group, Boko Haram, but it has carried out many such attacks before, using young female suicide bombers. At the same time, there is a lot of action going on across north-east Nigeria involving the Boko Haram troops and the Nigerian military, as well as soldiers from Chad who have crossed the border. There has been some success against Boko Haram fighters, with some towns and villages being retaken, but that is not to say that things are full. There have been several attacks on vulnerable rural communities, with several people killed over the last few days. A peaceful rally that ended in bloodshed - two people were killed and several more injured when a bomb went off at the rally in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, marking the first anniversary of the uprising that led to the toppling of the pro-Russian President Yanukovich. But there’s still hope that at least some aspects of the Ukrainian peace plan brokered in Minsk will be honoured. Our correspondent, Paul Adams, reports from eastern Ukraine. A rally for unity thrown into chaos by a single, lehtal explosion. The authorities in Kharkiv, in Ukraine’s second largest city, called this an act of terrorism that left at least two people dead. This was one of several rallies held all over the country to mark a year since the fall of Ukraine’s previous pro-Russian president. Further south, near the scene of the government’s recent defeat at Debaltseve, Ukrainian armour on the move. This is not yet the withdrawal of heavy guns. But the two sides do now say that process can start. For months, the guns and rockets have rained down on places like Donetsk - neighbourhoods close to the airport now practically deserted. The hardy few who remain have heard the news and they don’t believe it. TRANSLATION: Of course not. It will continue, like in previous times. It’s not the first Minsk agreement. The last time they said they would withdrawal military vehicles but then they told us they have no equipment to move them. When I was last here, in September, it was just after the last ceasefire and this area close to the airport hadn’t been shelled for that long. Since then, it’s been absolutely relentless. You can see the evidence all around, and there’s unexploded weaponry lying in the middle of the road. Hardly surprising people who live here doubt that weapons will be withdrawn. International monitors are sceptical, too. They want to know where the weapons are, how they’ll be moved and where they’ll be stored. The process has yet to start. Egypt’s president says there is an urgent need for a pan-Arab force to fight terrorism in the region. In a televised address, he told Egyptians thatIordan had offered to send military support after 21 Christian Copts were killed by Islamic State Militants last week. The Grand Sheikh of Sunni Islam’s most respected seat of learning has called for a radical overhaul of religious teaching to combat the spread of extremism in Muslim countries. Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayib, who’s the Grand Imam of Cairo’s Al-Azhar University, told a counter-terrorism conference that a historical misreading of the Koran and the life of the Prophet Muhammad had encouraged intolerant interpretations of Islam. According to the Chinese zodiac, the Year of the Sheep began last week and pictures of the animal can be seen all across Asia along with the odd goat, but that’s a different story. One cafe in Seoul in South Korea has decided to take his new four-legged friends looks at what the year ahead might hold. Hello. This is a cafe in Seoul. It has a gimmick, but we’re going to go along with it. First of all, what does it mean in terms of the zodiac? Let me quote the zodiac. ""The Year of the Sheep is for people described as elegant, intelligent, dependable, calm individuals who are very creative. ""They can be shy, pessimistic and puzzled about life"", it says. ""They prefer to be alone."" That’s the Year the Sheep. But whether you accept this or not, but in any New Year there’s a time for looking forward - that’s what it’s about. In this country, in Korea, it’s about two things. In South Korea, it’s about the economy. There have beenjitters There have been jitters about There have beenjitters about the economy in 2014 and those jitters continue. People are worried about growth. It’s been something like 3.5%, tidy, but maybe less, not so good. The other thing is of course this divided peninsula. What’s going to happen between the north and south? Both Pyongyang and Seoul have been making soft noises. They seem to want to get together. The Americans are a bit tougher. So, what’s going to happen with the economy? Decent growth, but we’re not certain about it. And also maybe softer rhetoric will turn into some kind of rapprochement between the north and south. That’s what the New Year might hold. The good thing for these beasts is that lamb isn’t really eaten in Korea. And updating you on the Oscars awards in Hollywood. IK Simmons has the award for Best Leading Actor. The Grand Budapest Hotel has won the award for Best Costume. The Polish film, Ida, as one in the Best film, Ida, as one in the Foreign-language Film. Hello there. After a wet and windy Sunday, it will be windy on Monday and it will feel cold. But most of us should see some sunshine between the wintry showers, of which there will be plenty. Low pressure in charge and the winds are strong. Those strong winds actually help to keep temperatures in most towns and cities above freezing first thing. But it will feel cold this Monday morning. Plenty of sunshine showers working into Scotland. About 200 metres, but it could hit low levels. Across England and Wales, many places. The working week will start with sunshine. But it will feel bitter. There will be some showers across central and southern parts of England and Wales, snow over the tops of the hills and mountains, but at lower levels, you might see sleet or get one or two hail showers. The showers will keep coming through the day. Yes, there will be spells of sunshine, quite a lot through eastern areas, but there will be a blustery wind throwing showers across all areas. Quite a bit of snow by the end of the day across north-west Scotland. Temperatures will reach five to eight degrees, but don’t forget that wind. It will make it feel much colder. It will feel about freezing in most places because of the icy wind, which continues to blow on Monday evening, if you are going out. Showers may fade in some areas, but keep going in Scotland and Northern Ireland, snow on the hills. Showers return later in the night, across more southern parts of the UK. Why so windy and wintry? Well, low pressure is dominating. That low slowly pulls away on Tuesday. A lot of isobars still on the chart, so blustery, but as it goes, showers will fade. Tuesday afternoon offers more sunshine and fewer showers. There will still be some snow showers coming in across northern and western parts of Scotland over the hills. More snow showers to come in northern England, too. Temperatures a bit higher but still it will feel cold. There will be a bitter wind blowing. The low finally clears on Tuesday night, isobars open a little. That allows things to turn frosty before an approaching weather front brings in cloud and rain into western areas during the day. In the east, a dry and bright day on Wednesday. After a frosty start, temperatures go up to seven or eight degrees. Temperatures further west could get up to nine or ten degrees, but there will be wet weather coming in. And throughout the week ahead, strong winds, often wet, and on Monday, feeling cold. Goodbye.

Australia and South Korea are in positive territory. Hong Kong is taking a break, retreating after the Chinese lunar New Year holidays.

Fears that Greece could be forced from the Eurozone might be felt beyond the borders of Europe. A spokesperson from the motley force says that a deal would be unlikely. I have doubts as to whether they will agree a deal in the first place -- Motley Four. The Greeks are being pragmatic and saying that we cannot achieve this.

We saw what would happen when this deal was struck between the Greece and a traitor - those lending money. Then the stock market rose to. It hasn’t been dismount -- discounted. Singapore is under pressure to save money in the budget this week and looks to cutting subsidies on food, fuel and others by billions. Can it make budget cuts and protect the poor? Our correspondent reports. This red coloured gas cylinder, formerly known as LPG, is used by millions of households across India to cook food. The garments -- governance applies it at a discounted rates. The subsidy is crucial for this woman to afford the cylinder. TRANSLATION: I earn $90 every month. My expenditure is more than that. Right now my husband is not working because of bad health, so I am taking care of all of the household expenses. If I have to pay the full market rise for the cylinder, I won’t be able to management monthly expenditure. Every household in India with an LPG connection, irrespective of the social or economic status receives 12 subsidise cylinders every year. But now the government wants to provide a subsidy to those families that are poor and cannot afford to PHY that are poor and cannot afford to pay the full price. The subsidy cost the government nearly $7 billion last year. To ensure that cheap gas goes to those who need it, the government has rolled out a new scheme under which it will directly transfer the subsidy in the form of money to bank accounts. This method would also help identify those who actually need the subsidy. But removing the we minimise the non-productive expenditure either by capping the mechanism of distribution when subsidies come to the fore. That will be important for the government to dwell on because it needs to be started investment -- starting. And unless we can convert non-productive expenditure and productive expenditure, India will be grappling with their stress. The government has given itself five years to bring in the distribution system. If it succeeds in identifying those who need cheap gas and delivering it to them, that could help the Treasury save up to 1.5 million dollars annually. -- one $.5 billion. They can use that money more productively elsewhere -- $1.5 billbion. Speaking of budgets, Singapore unveiled today what might be the last budget before the general election. It is expected to include more welfare benefits to help the ageing population and voters with the rising cost of healthcare and other services. Economic growth slowed to 2.9% last year 4.4% in 2013. Today marks the fourth anniversary of the deadly earthquake that destroyed much of the second largest city in New Zealand, Christ year. Huge numbers ofjurors are headed for the cricket World Cup this year. -- Christchurch. Can the nation cope? We asked the CEO of Christchurch tourism about rebuilding efforts. The rebuild has started in earnest. 6000 houses built last year. 72 new bars, restaurant and cafes have openedin bars, restaurant and cafes have opened in the last year and we have increased the number of hotels we are operating - we only had increased the number of hotels we are operating- we only had eight after the earthquake, we had 39. We have a long way to go. We have 22 now. Some say the pace of rebuilding has been slow in Christchurch. People don’t understand with earthquakes that you have the repair the underground infrastructure. We are New Zealand’s second-largest city - 60% of the repairs are complete. 95% of those are complete in the CBD. It hasn’t been possible to start construction on large buildings until the process is completed. The efforts to complete that have been intense. Every day up to 70 crews are on the streets underground fixing that infrastructure. The rebuild will take more time - what is the total bill for this? take more time - what is the total bill forthis? In 2011 it take more time - what is the total bill for this? In 2011 it was slated at 9 billion. I think 40 is about it and it is quite accurate. We know the scale of the projects now and there has been a much better understanding of the true cost of fixing the infrastructure under the city as well. Tim Hunter speaking with our correspondent. How do you organise a horse race as famous and lucrative as the Melbourne Cup or even the Royal Ascot? Even though gambling on horses is popular in Asia, the region does not host many races with name recognition. Perhaps until now - a race in Singapore hopes to become the next watch on the international horseracing calendar and it is doing it right targeting a specific crowd as our correspondent finds out. I am here at the Singapore’s richest horse race and unlike other thoroughbred horse races in the region, once unusual is that it targets mainland Chinese audiences -- what’s. And Chinese communities in the region. It has been held here at the China Course Club for the first time outside China here in Singapore and they plan to run the race for the three years. This is the founder of the China Course Club, looking to promote the fledgeling industry. It is organised as a global event to promote the understanding and participation of mainland Chinese to experience the established facilities, infrastructure, and to network with the foreign guests. Singapore is the perfect east-west meeting melting pot area. Let’s talk about prizemoney - you are offering $2 million US, which is the biggest prize money for a race in Singapore. Went and had internationally, you have the Dubai world, $10 million, the Melbourne Cup, over $5 billion, how can your race even begin to rival these others? -- when you compare internationally. Prizemoney won’t compare internationally. Prizemoney won’t make it famous. However, judging from the response and the market size from China, we believe very soon the Cup will be one of those everyone - horse industries and others - will be watching. Sponsors will want to participate because we have a huge audience coverage in China and overseas. And for this first race, it is the favourite - the American horse Veranda that wins. The race is part of the China equal and cultural festival which aims to promote not just culture but business and tourism for the Chinese market-- equine. Celebrities and artist had been flown from the mainland and it is hoped the number of Chinese audiences at home and in the region could catapult this race as the next to watch. Before we go, a recap of the markets - most of Asia is in positive territory after the eurozone finance ministers agreed The first winners of the Oscars are announced - IK Simmons wins with Whiplash. Two former British Foreign Secretary is has been filmed in an undercover investigation apparently offering to use their positions and contacts to benefit clients in return for substantial payments -- foreign secretaries. The veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell has provoked a row over comments he’s reported to have made about his Great Grimsby seat. A Sunday newspaper claimed he said Labour would hold the constituency at the next election even if it chose a "" raving alcoholic sex paedophile"" to fight it. Robin Brant reports. The people of Grimsby have voted in one direction for decades. Labour’s Austin Mitchell is about to stand down as MP after almost 40 years in the job, but he is not worried about his successor. He told the Independent on the that Labour would win, ""even if we selected a raving alcoholic sex paedophile"" as the candidate. He has since dismissed the story. He said he had not intended to cause offence. It was said like a joke. I don’t feel that because I have enormous respect for the electorate. Would Grimsby vote for anyone as long as they were Labour? He might be right. I don’t think UKIP will get in. This is a safe Labour seat. I think it’s the mentality of Grimsby people. But he is wrong because we all have a vote and we all have a say and we all have minds of our own. UKIP is pushing hard to take seats off of Labour in its northern heartland. This was Greater Manchester in October, where they almost did it. The party thinks that Austin Mitchell’s seat could be next. He is making a very cynical comment. It is about the electoral system in this country. He says that anyone could win for Labour in Great Grimsby. I’m not so sure about that because there is a serious challenge from UKIP. The reality is that most of the 650 constituencies in Parliament are safe seats. The same party usually wins them. Less than one third are considered marginal and fewer than one in 10 have changed sides in a general election since 1950. This is the heart of another very safe seat for Labour. It has been read on and off for more than 75 years. Islington north is also the home of Arsenal football club. This is the Emirates. -- It has been red on and off for more than 75 years. Islington North is also the home of Arsenal football club. This is the Emirates. The coming general election will be very tight and getting your supporters out, even the most loyal ones, will be absolutely crucial to every political party. Grimsby will decide on May 7th, but even here, any hint of complacency will not be welcome. A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of raping Karen Danczuk, the wife of the Rochdale Mp Simon Danczuk. The man is being questioned on suspicion of a series of historic sex offences alleged to have been committed between 1989 and 1995. An ex-policeman who’s one of three men being sought by police over the alleged racist incident involving Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro, has apologised for his involvement. But Richard Barklie said he wasn’t involved in racist chanting and isn’t a racist. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. This is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up on this programme: Match called off! Parma’s Serie A game against Udinese is cancelled with the club unable to pay stewards or police. It took a playoff but Iames Hahn won his maiden PGA Tour title at the Northern Trust Open. And David Ferrer wins the Rio Open with victory over Fabio Fognini. Hello and welcome to the programme, where it’s cricket we start with and Scotland are chasing 304 for victory in their Pool A match at the World Cup in Christchurch. The Scots won the toss and elected to field against England, who made 303 from their 50 overs. Moeen Ali top-scored with 128 and in response Scotland have moved to 27 for1. Around 1,000 Parma supporters protested in front of the team’s stadium on Sunday, where the Serie A match with Udinese was postponed because the cash-strapped club could not afford to pay stewards or police. Captain Alessandro Lucarelli slammed the Italian Federation and the Serie A league for allowing the chaos to continue. The players have not been paid all season. Supporters posted signs which read closed for robbery on the stadium gates as they gathered just before the originally scheduled kick-off time. Italian sports journalist Luca Ferrato told me a short while ago what may happen to the club over the coming days. Essentially, there are two possibilities. The first one is that the Italian Football Federation can financially assist them to continue until the end of this season. That is the official version. The Italian Football Federation deny the possibility but it could be a real possibility. In this case, it would have to be something very innovative, as you can imagine. The other one, the most possible, is that the municipality of the league. Otherwise, it would have to restart in the fourth or fifth tier. It would make a big difference. In matches that were played on Sunday, second-placed Roma failed to win at Hellas Verona, while Lazio moved fourth after a 2-1 win over Palermo, with Fiorentina dropping to fifth after only managing a 1-1 draw against Torino. Elsewhere, there were wins for Milan and Empoli. Liverpool are closing in on a top four spot in the English Premier League after beating Southampton 2-0 on Sunday, which means there’s nowjust four points separating five teams between third and seventh on the table. Brendan Rodgers’ side moved up to sixth place, within two points of fourth-placed Manchester United. They opened the scoring with a cracking long-range strike from Phillipe Coutinho that hit the crossbar and bounced in. Raheem Sterling guided in the second when the ball fell in his lap after Southampton’s Matt Targett slipped while trying to clear. Southampton felt hard done by with three penalty claims turned down in the first half. But Liverpool now have their eyes on a Champions League place. We never really got going until November but how we finish is going to be important. And as you can see, this team is getting better all the time. As I said, they are very confident, so hopefully, we can continue that. But this puts us three points off third place, which is great. Earlier, Harry Kane missed a penalty but put in the rebound as Tottenham came from two goals down to rescue a point against West Ham. That was Kane’s 24th goal of the season and moves Spurs to within three points of the top four. Former England centre back Matthew Upson headed an own goal in the 88th minute, which cost Leicester victory at Everton. The Premier League’s bottom club had been leading 2-1 through David Nugent and Esteban Cambiasso goals. The 2-2 draw leaves Leicester in last place, four points behind the three clubs above them. In Spain’s Primera Division, and Karim Benzema away to Elche. Earlier, David Moyes’ Real Sociedad beat Sevilla 4-3 with the winning goal scored in injury time. And there were also wins for Athletic Bilbao and Villareal. Following their 8-0 mauling by Bayern Munich last week, their worst ever league defeat, Hamburg returned to Bundesliga action on Sunday as they played host to third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. It was a different story this time. They took the lead with 17 minutes to go. Zoltan Stieber fired past Yann Sommer. But in stoppage time, the visitors grabbed an equaliser. Swedish substitute Branimir Hrgota headed in. Hamburg slip to 14th. Wolfsburg were looking to maintain an unbeaten run which has brought them eight wins in their last 11 games. They took the lead in the tenth minute, Bas Dost maintaining his remarkable feat of scoring in every Wolfsburg game this year. Hertha fought back, though, and equalised through Iulian Schieber. Wolfsburg were not to be denied and Dost sealed the result with his 11th goal in six competitive games. In the Dutch Eredevisie, leaders PSV Eindhoven won 3-0 at home to bottom club Dordrecht. A controversial penalty when Ilias Haddad wasjudged to have handled the ball gave Luuk De Iong the chance to make it 2-0 before Ieffrey Bruma added a third. They are now 14 points clear of Ajax. David Ferrer was a straight sets winner over Italy’s Fabio Fognini on Sunday to win the Rio Open. The Spanish second seed needed just 83 minutes to dispatch the Italian 6-2, 6-3 for his second title of 2015. It’s also an eighth consecutive win over Fognini for the Spaniard as the Italian failed to build on his semifinal win over Rafa Nadal. Victory for Ferrer is also his 23rd ATP singles title of his career. To Formula One and withjust three weeks to go until the start of the new season, McLaren driver Fernando Alonso has escaped uninjured from a heavy crash in pre-season testing. Alonso went off at turn three on Sunday and hit the wall at the Catalunya circuit in Barcelona. He was airlifted to hospital, where he’s spending the night. It remains unclear whether Alonso made a mistake or something broke on the car. Ioey Logano won his ninth but most important sprint car race on Sunday when he claimed the Daytona 500 in Florida. Logano’s previous best finish in NASCAR’s biggest race was ninth while reigning Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick finished second and was followed by Dale Earnhardt Ir, the defending race winner. ~ I was so i WGS So I’1âI’VOUS foI’ I was so nervous for the entire race I All of the guys worked so hard in the off-season. We were terrible here last year. So much hard work. The Oscars may be taking place in Hollywood at present but in the north of England, a former Oscar winner for Best Actor in Russell Crowe saw his Australian Rugby League club, South Sydney Rabbitohs, who he part owns, crowned World Club Champions after an emphatic 39-0 victory over English champions, St Helens, on Sunday. The Rabbitohs are NRL champions and scored seven tries to set a new record for the biggest winning margin in this match. Iames Hahn won his maiden PGA Tour title with England’s Paul Casey at the Northern Trust Open in California on Sunday. Hahn struck a wonderful tee shot at the third extra hole, which was the par three 14th, and sank a 24-foot birdie putt withIohnson missing. Casey had been eliminated on the previous hole, handing the 33-year-old the title after all three had finished regulation on 6-under and it also means Hahn secures a places for the first time at April’s Masters Tournament in Augusta. |,m I’m about to have another addition to the family and for me, that is most important thing. This is fantastic but in three, there is another reason for me to be more happy and more grateful for the things in my life. Anirban Lahiri won the Indian Open in Delhi, his second European Tour title in two weeks. Lahiri beat SSP Chawrasia in an all Indian playoff with a birdie on the first extra hole. That was all after an incredible comeback because Lahiri started the day seven shots behind overnight leader, Chawrasia. The victory comes just two weeks after Lahiri won his maiden European Tour title, the Malaysian Open. At the Cycling Track World Championships, Australian Anna Meares won an historic 11th women’s world title. She eclipsed the record gold medal mark of 10 she previously shared with Frenchwoman, Felicia Ballanger. Now, Scotland are Hello there. After a wet and windy Sunday, it will be windy on Monday and it will feel cold. But most of us should see some sunshine between the wintry showers, of which there will be plenty. Low pressure in charge and the winds are strong. Those strong winds actually help to keep temperatures in most towns and cities above freezing first thing. But it will feel bitterly cold this Monday morning. Plenty of snow showers working into Scotland. About 200 metres, but it could hit low levels. Across England and Wales, many places. working week will start with sunshine. But it will feel bitter. There will be some showers across central and southern parts of England and Wales, snow over the tops of the hills and mountains, but at lower levels, you might see sleet or get one or two hail showers. The showers will keep coming through the day. Yes, there will be spells of sunshine, quite a lot through eastern areas, but there will be a blustery wind throwing showers across all areas. Quite a bit of snow by the end of the day across north-west Scotland. Temperatures will reach five to eight degrees, but don’t forget that wind. It will make it feel much colder. It will feel about freezing in most places because of the icy wind, which continues to blow on Monday evening, if you are going out. Showers may fade in some areas, but keep going in Scotland and Northern Ireland, snow on the hills. Showers return later in the night, across more southern parts of the UK. Why so windy and wintry? Well, low pressure is dominating. The low slowly starts to pull away on Tuesday. A lot of isobars still on the chart, so blustery, but as it ebbs away, showers will fade. Tuesday afternoon offers more sunshine and fewer showers. There will still be some snow showers coming in across northern and western parts of Scotland over the hills. More snow showers to come in northern England, too. Temperatures a bit higher but still it will feel cold. There will be a bitter wind blowing. The low finally clears on Tuesday night and the isobars open a little. That allows things to turn frosty before an approaching weather front brings in cloud and rain into western areas during the day. In the east, a dry and bright day on Wednesday. After a frosty start, temperatures go up to seven or eight degrees. Temperatures further west could get up to nine or ten degrees, but there will be wet weather coming in. And throughout the week ahead, strong winds, often wet, and on Monday, feeling cold. Goodbye. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Ben Bland. Best Supporting Actress goes to Patricia Arquette and best supporting actor toIK Patricia Arquette and best supporting actor to IK Simmons at the Oscars in LA. Two former British foreign secretaries are to be investigated following claims they arranged access to officials in exchange for money. They deny any wrongdoing. The families of three British schoolgirls thought to be trying to join Islamic State in Syria appeal for them to come home. If you watch this, baby, please come home. Mum needs you more than anything in the world. Thank you forjoining us. We are 90 minutes into the biggest nights for the movie industry - the Academy Awards are under way and we are getting a good sense of where the prizes are going. There are bound to be a few surprises of course. Let’s update you on some of the awards that have been handed out: IK Simmons takes the prize for best supporting actor for his role in Whiplash. The award for Best Supporting Actress goes to Patricia Arquette for her 12 year long role in the film Boyhood. The Grand Budapest Hotel wins best costume and it takes the award for the best hair and make-up. The foreign language film, the film Ida has won the top honours. Our correspondent is in Hollywood. You have given us a competent to list of the winners so far. Interesting, there are no surprises. Pretty much those names you mentioned, those titles, were those movies that were expected to do well. Especially Patricia Arquette - winning Best Supporting Actress for Boyhood, playing the mother. This is dominant extraordinary venture made by the director who had this vision over the decade ago and saw its Root. -- who saw it through. It will be interesting to see whether he is honoured in the category later for the script. Patricia Arquette was certainly a favourite and this is a very popular win. Let me introduce mY very popular win. Let me introduce my guest to have some analysis as well. Amy Nicholson is chief film critic with the LA Weekly, and the BBC’s Tom Brook. Patricia Arquette is a popular winner, isn’t she? Absolutely. She had a standing ovation. The win was foreordained. Her speech was testament to equal faith. That was the way to use the wing and everyone knew she would win it anyway. Sometimes these speeches start and you think we will get a long list of names and that’s how Patricia Arquette’s started. However, she wanted to say something. It’s great to have an authentic statement from someone. It is so tedious to read out these names, even if they are loved ones - you want them to use the opportunity to think of a wider audience. She did seem all over the place however she had a message and she is a very authentic person. She played a very authentic character in Boyhood. She anchored it emotionally and everybody thinks she deserves the award. I wonder if there are any tea leaves we can read when we look later to the best picture category. We expected her to win, cars that bode well for the movie? It is very hard to say -- does that. Emotionally my heart wants Boyhood to win, however, I think Birdman will win because of the incredible technique. As we discussed earlier, it is about show people so to speak, which is what the town is about. Where is your heart emotionally? Grand Budapest Hotel. I think Birdman will take best picture and Linklater Best Director. On this debate, the B category, American sniper could be that a wildcard -- big category -- Happy sniper. It was a surprise to include it all -- Sniper. It did very well at the American box office - $300 million, which is no mean feat. Will it help the -- film? Yes. This film speaks to a moment. There is a reason why people want this to be awarded. I won’t be surprised if it takes best picture or even best actor. Bradley Cooper has been nominated three years in a row. Despite the controversy. . . years in a row. Despite the controversy... It has been a very polarising film. Basically, along political lines. There is this preferential voting system with foreign secretaries which could make it hard -- Best I would be very surprised. If anyone was Sniper. Interstellar has just one Best Visual Effects. And we thought the -- saw Best Foreign Film. It was in black and white and it had a fascinating story about a young nun in post-1960 Communist Poland who finds out she hasIewish parents. She goes on a journey with a relative played by fantastic polish actresses whose names I am unable to... I can’t do the names. It was beautifully put together and I am not surprised it one. People thought the Russian film leviathan would win however I was pleased to see it one -- Leviathan. Iwas however I was pleased to see it one -- Leviathan. I was surprised they nominated the film called While the Tale. It is the kind of thing you would expect them to award -- Wild Tales. It was revenge fantasy. It was in Almodovar film. He was the co-producer. It says something clever about Argentina. If you ask me, I wouldn’t be able to tell you. It focuses on the big names, however, there are the short animated films and the short action pictures - we have at the winners of those as well. It spotlights not just the big names but the industry of the whole. It does. It is hard to rid the system if you are supporting a short film. It is a merit as the award, which is beautiful. A film that touched you the other day, a film made in Northern Ireland about two Hens with the wondrous effect they have on a family. It’s great the Oscars celebrates these kind of films -- hens. It wasn’t the winner on the night, sadly, however, it touched me because I’m at the team behind the film and they came to Hollywood in all of what we lived in every day. We are used to seeing the Hollywood sign. I come to work like this every day. The fact is, it is a unique opportunity for the small-time filmmakers working on a small budget, as they were in Northern Ireland, suddenly to get a taste of the big time. And what is interesting is that they get the opportunity to meet the movers and shakers of Hollywood and they not only come for the show, they come for meetings that could kickstart future projects. Its true and massive talent has come out, like the winner of Six Shooter, and then coming out and directing In Bruges. We have a minute to go. Apart from the films and the big stars, this is described as the most influential catwalk in the business. We see the fashions on parade and this can mean big money for those fashion designers if they see their design on the beautiful actress and a down that gets most looking. Has anything left out at you as being very good this year? It has been safe, however, I love the look of Emma Stone. She has red hairand however, I love the look of Emma Stone. She has red hair and lipstick matching her beaded dress. She is very stylish. And Lepita, she won best supporting actor last year, she was stunning as well. Other people have pointed out. Absolutely. It looked like she was wearing her necklace as part of a gallon. Gorgeous. It can turn into a huge money for the designers. -- gown. It is product placement. On the highest profile show apart from the Super Bowl, this comes second to that as far as American audiences are concerned. And the gowns in Super Bowl are not worth talking about. Thank you vote for your time. We have the big categories to get to. The most fascinating this year is Best Picture because it isn’t an Dunn the favourite. -- there isn’t a favourite. With me is Louise Hosie, the BBC’s social media producer. Talking about Patricia Arquette’s talk about wage equality. That is what people are speaking about on Twitter at the moment. People applaud in herfor her comments made. We have seen hashtags local wage equality and equality trending in light of that. On a light note, conversation about what the stars are wearing as they arrive on the red carpet. Yes, attention returns to the catwalk. One person being treated about a lot is Lady Gaga for her outfit - per ensemble with some gloves people on Twitter compared to washing gloves with pictures doing the rounds -- her. She has 44 million followers on Twitter so she is being talked about. It looks like she rushed out of her home in a hurry and forgot to take off her washing-up gloves. Interesting item. As well as the comments from Patricia Arquette about wage equality, there was also some fairly political chatter about the dominance of white faces and the absence of black faces at the Neil Patrick Harris referred to this at the beginning of the ceremony in his song and dance opening number, in one of the lines he says, Hollywood’s best and whitest, I mean, brightest, picked up on social media. People are debating about that. Another topic that has gathered momentum has been this idea of notjust focusing gathered momentum has been this idea of not just focusing on what the actresses and the female stars are wearing but to ask them about themselves and this hashtag that has emerged and supported I Reese Witherspoon, ask her more, what more do you know? This is for women who have been on the red carpet and the feeling about the questions they have been asked being too shallow -- by Reese Witherspoon. Reese Witherspoon has been treating about this and encouraging people to ask the more intelligent questions, using this hashtag, ask her name. Thank you very much. And don’t forget you can go to our website for a closer look at the nominees - we’re live blogging the ceremony there and keeping you up to date with all the latest winners.

We know that these are testing times for everyone here and for everyone sworn to protect democratic freedoms. The terrorist threat is rising at home and abroad and is becoming harder to combat. Today, I can confirm that the government will be taking action against hate preachers. This includes enforcing our antiterrorism laws. It includes new programmes to challenge terrorist propaganda and to provide alternative online material based on Australian values. And it will include stronger prohibitions on vilifying, intimidating or inciting hatred. According to the Chinese zodiac, the year of the sheep again last week. -- began. One cafe in South Korea has decided to take things one step further. Our correspondent has been to visit and is looking at what the year ahead might hold. Hello. This is a cafe in Seoul. It has a gimmick, but we’re going to go along with it. First of all, what does it mean in terms of the zodiac? Let me quote the zodiac. ""The Year of the Sheep is for people described as elegant, intelligent, dependable, calm individuals who are very creative. ""They can be shy, pessimistic and puzzled about life"", it says. ""They prefer to be alone."" That’s the Year the Sheep. But whether you accept this or not, but in any New Year there’s a time for looking forward - that’s what it’s about. In this country, in Korea, it’s about two things. In South Korea, it’s about the economy. There have beenjitters There have been jitters about There have beenjitters about the economy in 2014 and those jitters continue. People between the north and south? Both Pyongyang and Seoul have been making soft noises. They seem to want to get together. The Americans are a bit tougher. There seems to be a bit of a division between Washington and Seoul in their attitudes towards Pyongyang. We simply don’t know how that softer rhetoric on the peninsular and from Pyongyang is going to play out. So, what’s going to happen with the economy? Decent growth, but we’re not certain about it. And also maybe softer rhetoric will turn into some kind of rapprochement between the north and south. That’s what the New Year might hold. The good thing for these beasts is that lamb isn’t really eaten in Korea. People like these animals for their wool, People like these animals fortheirwool, but for their wool, but not their meat. For them, that’s a mercy. Let’sjust bring you a reminder of our main story this evening. The Academy Awards in Hollywood. Who’ve been the big winners so far? One of lead . the big surprises so far has been the choice of Ida as Best Foreign-language Film. The Polish film looks at a novice nun who reconnects with her past. In the last half hour, as expected, Patricia Arquette has won the Best Supporting Actress award for her role in Boyhood, perhaps just reward for a film that took 12 years to make. In her speech, she called for equal rights for women. And, also as expected, IK Simmons won the first big award of the night for his role as a cruel jazz teacher in the drama Whiplash. In his acceptance speech, he showed a rather kinder side by suggesting everyone call their parents. And in the last few minutes, the Disney film, Big Hero Six, has taken the award for Best Animated Feature. Hello there. After a wet and windy Sunday, it will be windy on Monday and it will feel cold. But most of us should see some sunshine between the wintry showers, of which there will be plenty. Low pressure in charge and the winds are strong. Those strong winds actually help to keep temperatures in most towns and cities above freezing first thing. But it will feel bitterly cold this Monday morning. Plenty of snow showers working into Scotland about 200 metres, but it could hit low levels. Across England and Wales, many places will start the working week with sunshine. But it will feel bitter. There will be some showers across central and southern parts of England and Wales, snow over the tops of the hills and mountains, but at lower levels, you might see sleet or get one or two hail showers. The showers will keep coming through the day. Yes, there will be spells of sunshine, quite a lot through eastern areas, but there will be a blustery wind throwing showers across all areas. Quite a bit of snow by the end of the day across north-west Scotland. Temperatures will reach five to eight degrees, but don’t forget that wind. It will make it feel much, much colder. It will feel about freezing in most places because of the icy wind, which continues to blow on Monday evening, if you are going out. Showers may fade in some areas, but keep going in Scotland and Northern Ireland, snow on the hills. Showers return later in the night, across more southern parts of the UK. Why so windy and wintry? Well, low pressure is dominating. The low slowly starts to pull away on Tuesday. A lot of isobars still on the chart, so blustery, but as it ebbs away, showers will fade. Tuesday afternoon offers more sunshine and fewer showers. There will still be some snow showers coming in across northern and western parts of Scotland over the hills. More snow showers to come in northern England, too. Temperatures a bit higher but still it will feel cold. There will be a bitter wind blowing. The low finally clears on Tuesday night and the isobars open a little. That allows things to turn frosty before an approaching weather front brings in cloud and rain into western areas during the day. In the east, a dry and bright day on Wednesday. After a frosty start, temperatures go up to seven or eight degrees. Temperatures further west could get up to nine or ten degrees, but there will be wet weather coming in. And throughout the week ahead, strong winds, often wet, and on Monday, feeling cold. Goodbye. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Ben Bland. The Oscars Ceremony is under way in Los Angeles. The Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor has gone toIK Simmonds for his role as an abusive music professor in Whiplash. Best Supporting Actress went to Patricia Arquette. The award for Best Foreign Language Film went to Ida, by the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski, Two former British Foreign Secretaries have been filmed in an undercover investigation apparently offering to use their positions and contacts to benefit companies in return for substantial payments. Both men have strongly denied any wrongdoing and referred themselves to the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards. The families of three British schoolgirls thought to be heading to Syria to join Islamic State have appealed for them to come home. The girls, who attended the same school in east London, told their parents they were going out for the day. It’s not clear whether they have crossed into Syria from Turkey. The chief executive of HSBC, Stuart Gulliver, who has promised to reform the scandal-hit British bank, has himself been accused of keeping millions of pounds in a secret Swiss account. Now on BBC News, all the latest business news live from Singapore. Asian stock markets rise after Greece gets a four-month extension on its debt repayments. And they are off- the new horse race on the regional calendar hopes to woo Chinese punters. Hello, you’re watching Asia Business Report. Regional markets are in positive territory in mid-morning trade. It’s reacting to the moves from Greece to restructure its debt. Iapan is at a fresh 15-year high. Australia and South Korea are in positive territory. Hong Kong is taking a break, retreating after the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays. Greece has been given a four-month extension on its debt payments in a breakthrough agreement in Brussels. This hinges on Greece proposing reforms to creditors on Monday. Fears that Greece could be forced from the eurozone may be felt beyond the borders of Europe. A member of the Motley Four says that, despite the four month respite, a deal would be unlikely. I have doubts as to whether they will agree a deal in the first place. What we have at the moment is the Greeks being pragmatic. They’re saying that they cannot achieve this, what they are asking us to do, we can’t achieve. You have Greek pragma on the one hand, you have German dogma on the other hand. The germans say, when you owe money, you must pay it. The two combined creates financial magma. You have this volcano that will erupt in some time. Dogma, pragma, magma - will they be discounted? No it hasn’t been discounted, because people hope something will happen. We saw what would happen when this deal was struck between the Greecks and the troika - those lending money. Then the stock market rose, it hasn’t been discounted. India’s government is under pressure to save money in this week’s budget and could be looking at cutting subsidies on food, fuel and fertiliser ivy billions of dollars. Can it make budget cuts and protect the poor? Our correspondent reports. This red-coloured gas cylinder, formerly known as LPG, is used by millions of households across India to cook food. -- commonly known. The government supplies it at a discounted rate, compared to the market price. For a lot of people, the subsidy is crucial to afford the cylinder. TRANSLATION: I earn $90 every month, but my expenditure is more than that. Right now, my husband is not working because of bad health, so I am taking care of all of the household expenses. If I have to pay the full market price for the cylinder, I won’t be able to manage my monthly expenditure. Every household in India with an LPG connection, irrespective of their social or economic status, receives 12 subsidised cylinders every year. But now the government wants to provide a subsidy to those families that are poor and cannot afford to pay the full price. The subsidy cost the government nearly $7 billion last year. To ensure that cheap gas only goes to those who need it, the government has rolled out a new scheme under which it will directly transfer the subsidy in the form of money to bank accounts. This method would also help identify those who actually need the subsidy. But removing the subsidy for those who can afford to pay the full price could be a big challenge. The whole idea of government finances is how we minimise the non-productive expenditure either by capping the total amount or by improving the mechanism of distribution when subsidies come to the fore. That will be important for the government to dwell on because it needs to be starting investment. And unless we can convert non-productive expenditure into productive expenditure, India will be grappling with their stress. gas and delivering it to them, that could help the Treasury save up to $1.5 billion annually. Then they could use that money more productively elsewhere. Speaking of budgets, Singapore unveiled its own today in what might be the last budget before the general election. It is expected to include more welfare benefits to help an ageing population and voters with the rising cost of healthcare and other services. Economic growth slowed to 2.9% last year, from 4.4% in 2013. Today marks the fourth anniversary of the deadly earthquake that destroyed much of the second largest city in New Zealand, Christchurch. This year, huge numbers of tourists are headed there for the Cricket World Cup. Can the nation cope? We asked the CEO of Christchurch Tourism about rebuilding efforts. The rebuild has started in earnest. 6,000 houses built last year. 72 new bars, restaurants and cafes have opened in the last year and we have increased the number of hotels we are operating. We only had eight after the earthquake, we had 39. So we had a long way to go. We have 22 now. Some say the pace of rebuilding has been slow in Christchurch. I think what people don’t understand with earthquakes is that you have the repair all the underground infrastructure. We are New Zealand’s second-largest city. 60% of those repairs are complete. 95% of those repairs are complete in the CBD. But it hasn’t been possible to start construction on large buildings until that process is completed. The efforts to complete that have been intense. Every day up to 70 crews are on the streets underground fixing that infrastructure. The rebuild will take more time. What is the total bill going to be for this? In 2011 it was slated at $9 billion. I think 40 is about it and it is quite accurate. We know the scale of the projects now and there has been a much better understanding of the true cost of fixing the infrastructure under the city as well. That was Tim Hunter speaking with our correspondent. How do you organise a horse race as famous and lucrative as the Melbourne Cup or even the Royal Ascot? -- as lucrative as the. Even though gambling on horses is popular in Asia, the region does not host many races with the same name recognition. Perhaps until now. A race in Singapore hopes to become the next one to watch on the international horseracing calendar and it is doing it by targeting a specific crowd, as our correspondent finds out. I’m here at the Singapore’s richest horse race and, unlike other thoroughbred horse races in the region, what’s unusual is that it targets mainland Chinese audiences and Chinese communities in the region. It’s been held by the China Horse Club for the first time outside China, here in Singapore, and they plan to run the race for the three years. -- for the next three years. The founder of the China Course Club is looking to promote the fledgeling industry. It is organised as a global event to promote the understanding and participation of mainland Chinese to experience the established facilities, infrastructure, and to network with the foreign guests. Singapore is the perfect east-west meeting melting pot area. Let’s talk about prizemoney. You’re offering $2 million US, which is the biggest prize money for a race in Singapore. But when you compare it internationally, you have the Dubai World Cup, $10 million, the Melbourne Cup, at over $5 million, how can your race even begin to rival these others? Prizemoney won’t make it famous. However, judging from the response and the market sizes from China, we believe very soon the Cup will perhaps be one of those everybody, horse industries and others, will be watching. Sponsors will want to participate because we have a huge audience in China and overseas. And for this first race, it is the favourite, an American horse, Veranda, that wins it. The race is part of the China Equine Cultural Festival, which aims to promote not just culture, but business and tourism for the Chinese market. Celebrities and artists from the mainland have been flown and it is hoped the number of Chinese audiences at home and in the region could catapult this race as the next to watch. Let’s recap the market at midday trade. Currently most of Asia is in positive territory. The likes of Iapan and Australia. The Hang Seng index is down 116 points after the Chinese New Year break. Goodbye for now. The and Patricia Arquette has won Best Two former British foreign secretaries is has been filmed in an undercover investigation apparently offering to use their positions and contacts to benefit clients in return for substantial payments. The veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell has provoked a row over comments he’s reported to have made about his Great Grimsby seat. A Sunday newspaper claimed he said Labour would hold the constituency at the next election even if it chose a "" raving alcoholic sex paedophile"" to fight it. Robin Brant reports. The people of Grimsby have voted in one direction for decades. Labour’s Austin Mitchell is about to stand down as MP after almost 40 years in the job, but he is not worried about his successor. He told the Independent on the that Labour would win, ""even if we selected a raving alcoholic sex paedophile"" as the candidate. -- on Sunday. He has since dismissed the story. But he’s also said he didn’t mean to cause offence. It was said like a joke like I’ll vote for a pig if they put him up. I don’t feel that because I have enormous respect for the electorate. So, would Grimsby vote for anyone as long as they were Labour? He might be right. I don’t think UKIP will get in. I think this is a safe Labour seat. I think it’s the mentality of Grimsby people. Which to me is wrong, because we all have a vote and we all have a say and we all have minds of our own. UKIP is pushing hard to take seats off of Labour in its northern heartland. This was Greater Manchester in October, where they almost did it. The party leader thinks that Austin Mitchell’s seat could be next. He’s making a very cynical comment about the electoral system in this country. He’s saying that anyone could win for Labour in Great Grimsby. I’m not so sure about that because there is a serious challenge from UKIP. The reality is that most of the 650 constituencies in Parliament are safe seats. The same party usually wins them. Less than a third are considered marginal and fewer than one in ten have changed sides in the majority of elections since 1950. This is the heart of another very safe seat for Labour. It has been red on and off for more than 75 years. Islington North is also the home of Arsenal football club. This is the Emirates. Now, the coming general election will be very tight and getting your supporters out, even the most loyal ones, will be absolutely crucial to every political party. Grimsby will decide on May 7th, but even here, any hint of complacency will not be welcome. An ex-policeman, who’s one of three men being sought by police over the alleged racist incident involving Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro, has apologised for his involvement. But Richard Barklie said he wasn’t involved in racist chanting and isn’t a racist. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. Hello, this is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up on this programme: Match called off! Parma’s Serie A game against Udinese is cancelled with the club unable to pay stewards or police. It took a playoff, but Iames Hahn won his maiden PGA Tour title at the Northern Trust Open. And David Ferrer wins the Rio Open with victory over Fabio Fognini. Hello and welcome to the programme, where it’s cricket we start and Scotland are chasing 304 for victory in their Pool A match at the World Cup in Christchurch. The Scots won the toss and elected to field against England who made 303 from their 50 overs. Loss of eight wickets. Moeen Ali top scored with 128 and in response Scotland have moved. They were at 74 -3 in the 20th over. Around 1,000 Parma supporters protested in front of the team’s stadium on Sunday where the Serie A match with Udinese was postponed because the cash-strapped club could not afford to pay stewards or police. Captain Alessandro Lucarelli slammed the Italian federation and the Serie A league for allowing the chaos to continue - the players have not been paid all season. Supporters posted signs which read ""closed for robbery"" on the stadium gates as they gathered just before the originally scheduled kickoff time of 1400 GMT. Italian sports journalist Luca Ferrato told me a short while ago what may happen to the club over the coming days. Essentially, there are two possibilities. The first one is that the Italian Football Federation can financially assist Parma to continue until the end of this season. That is the official version. The Italian Football Federation deny the possibility but it could be a real possibility. In this case, it would have to be something very innovative, as you can imagine. The other one, the most possible, is that the municipality would assist Parma to pay all of the bills and players until the end of this season. In this case, it could be quite good because next year the club could restart in the Serie B. Otherwise, it would have to restart in the fourth or fifth tier. to win at Hellas Verona while Lazio moved fourth after a 2-1 win over Palermo with Fiorentina dropping to 5th after only managing a 1-1 draw against Torino. Elsewhere, there were wins for Milan and Empoli. Liverpool are closing in on a top four spot in the English Premier League after beating Southampton 2-0 on Sunday which means there’s nowjust four points separating five teams, between third and seventh on the table. Brendan Rodgers’ side moved up to sixth place, within two points of fourth-placed Manchester United. They opened the scoring with a cracking long-range strike from Phillipe Coutinho that hit the crossbar and bounced in. Raheem Sterling guided in the second when the ball fell in his lap after Southampton’s Matt Targett slipped while trying to clear. Southampton felt hard done by with three penalty claims turned down in the first half. But Liverpool now have their eyes on a Champions League place. We never really got going until November but how we finish is going to be important. And as you can see, this team is getting better all the time. As I said, they are very confident, so hopefully, we can continue that. But this puts us three points off third place, which is great. Earlier, Harry Kane missed a penalty but put in the rebound as Tottenham came from two goals down to rescue a point against West Ham. That was Kane’s 24th goal of the season and moves Spurs to within three points of the top four. Former England centre-back Matthew Upson headed an own goal in the 88th minute which cost Leicester victory at Everton. The Premier League’s bottom club had been leading 2-1 through David Nugent and Esteban Cambiasso goals. The 2-2 draw leaves Leicester in last place, four points behind the three clubs above them. In Spain’s Primera Division, Real Madrid have moved four points clear at the top thanks to second half goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim for Athletic Bilbao and Villareal. Following their 8-0 mauling by Bayern Munich last week, their worst ever league defeat, Hamburg returned to Bundesliga action on Sunday as they played host to third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. It was a different story this time, they took the lead with 17 minutes to go. Zoltan Stieber fired past Yann Sommer But in stoppage time the visitors grabbed an equaliser. Swedish substitute Branimir Hrgota headed in. Hamburg slip to fourteenth. Wolfsburg were looking to maintain an unbeaten run which has brought them eight wins in their last 11 games. They took the lead in the 10th minute. Bas Dost maintaining his remarkable feat of scoring in every Wolfsburg game this year. Hertha fought back though and equalised through Iulian Schieber. Wolfsburg were not to be denied though and Dost sealed the result with his 11th goal in six competitive games. In the Dutch Eredevisie, leaders PSV Eindhoven won three nil at home to bottom club Dordrecht. A controversial penalty when Ilias Haddad wasjudged to have handled the ball gave Luuk De Iong the chance to make it 2-0 before Ieffrey Bruma added a third. They are now 14 points clear of Ajax. David Ferrer was a straight sets winner over Italy’s Fabio Fognini on Sunday to win the Rio Open. The Spanish second seed needed just 83 minutes to dispatch the Italian 6-2 6-3 for his second title of 2015. It’s also an 8th consecutive win over Fognini for the Spaniard as the Italian failed to build on his semi final win over Rafa Nadal. Thank you very much, I’m really IÂÂppvÂ Thank you very much, I’m really happy. It is my 23rd tournament, winning in Rio, that is my first time that I’ve won here. I’m happy for that. A bit ofa A bit of a party in the background! To Formula 1 and with just three weeks to go until the start of the new season McLaren driver Fernando Alonso has escaped uninjured from a heavy crash in pre-season testing. Alonso went off at turn three on Sunday and hit the wall at the Catalunya circuit in Barcelona. He was airlifted to hospital where he’s spending the night. It remains unclear whether Alonso made a mistake or something broke on the car. Ioey Logano won his 9th but most important sprint car race on Sunday when he claimed the Daytona 500 in Florida. Logano’s previous best finish in NASCAR’s biggest race was ninth while reigning Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick finished second and was followed by Dale Earnhardt Ir., the defending race winner. ~ I was so i WGS So I’1âl’VOUS, had my spotter, all of the guys, this is our weakest race track, they superspeedway, we had a terrible time last year, worked hard, the hard work shows results every time. The Oscars may be taking place in Hollywood at present but in the North of England a former Oscar winner for Best Actor in Russell Crowe saw his Australian Rugby League club South Sydney Rabbitohs who he part owns crowned world club champions after an emphatic 39-0 victory over English champions St Helens on Sunday. The Rabbitohs are NRL champions and scored seven tries to set a new record for the biggest winning margin in this match. In golf, Iames Hahn won his maiden PGA Tour title with an entertaining playoff victory over fellow American Dustin Iohnson and Hahn struck a wonderful tee shot at the third extra hole which was the the 33-year-old the title after all three had finished regulation on 6 under and it also means Hanhn secures a places for the first time at April’s Masters Tournament in Augusta. MY My golf life changes, but more importantly, I can spend time with mY importantly, I can spend time with my family. I’m looking forward to it. Winning the tournament is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. But in three weeks, I’m sure there will be another reason why I’m more happy and more grateful for these things in my life. Anirban Lahiri won the Indian Open in Delhi- his second European Tour title in two weeks.Lahiri beat SSP Chawrasia in an all Indian play-off with a birdie on the first extra hole. That was all after an incredible comeback - because Lahiri started the day seven shots behind overnight leader Chawrasia. The victory comes just two weeks after Lahiri won his maiden European tour title, the Malaysian Open. At the cycling track World Championships, Australian Anna Meares won an historic 11th women’s world title. She took the women’s keirin to eclipse the record gold medal mark of 10 she previously shared with Frenchwoman Felicia Ballanger. Iust to let you know, the website is where it all is.

Our top stories: Best Supporting Actress goes to Patricia Arquette and Best Supporting Actor to IK Simmonds at the Oscars in Los Angeles. Two former British foreign secretaries are to be investigated following claims they arranged access to officials in exchange for money. They deny any wrongdoing. The families of three British schoolgirls thought to be trying to join Islamic State in Syria appeal for them to come home. If you watch this, baby, please come home. Mum needs you more than anything in the world. We’re now more than two hours in to the movie industry’s biggest night of the year, the 87th Academy Awards. Statuettes have been handed out, though we’re waiting for the prestigious Best Picture award. Now an update on the some of the winners so far. IK Simmons has taken the prize for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film Whiplash. The award for Best Supporting Actress went to Patricia Arquette, for her 12 year long role in the film Boyhood. Birdman took out the Oscar for Best Cinematography. The Grand Budapest Hotel has won three Oscars for Best Hair and Make Up, for Costume Design and Production Design. In the Foreign Language Film Category, the Polish black and white film Ida has won top honours. And the Best Animated Feature Film went to the Disney movie Big Hero 6. The BBC’s Peter Bowes is in Hollywood. What’s the latest? What the reaction to those winners so far? It is proving to be a very interesting evening. What Oscars watchers often do at this stage of the night is look at who’s winning in those categories that don’t get so much high-profile attention and see if you can see if those films have a better chance of winning Best Picture. Two films, Whiplash and the grand Budapest hotel, are tying at the moment with three wins each. -- Grand Budapest Hotel. Whiplash has one in every award category in which it has been nominated. Best picture is still to come. Whether we can read into that, perhaps my guests can enlighten me on that. We have the film critic of the LA Weekly newspaper and Tom Brook presents Talking Movies on the BBC. It is interesting to try to figure out whether if one film is winning in other categories, does that mean for example that Whiplash could win Best Picture? I know you really like the film and you would like to see it get Best Picture, but the chances are motor. It is interesting that it’s a small film. -- chances of remote. The academy is probably looking at mainstream films, and it emerged at much attention. There is that going on. The other film doing well in America is Grand Budapest Hotel.. It has three so far and it might get one more. I don’t think it’s going to do anything beyond that, it was it’s pretty locked up. The other film that people thought would win Best Picture is Boyhood, which is a film that took 12 years to make. It’s only gotten one award so far, for cinematography. I -- and Patricia Arquette. Two. Both Boyhood and Whiplash premiered last year. If you had told me at the premiere of Whiplash that this film would go all around the globe and then be here one year later, I would have thought you were crazy. But he Academy is really rewarding this film. But drummers think it is a mess. You mentioned Patricia Arquette. Of all the awards that was perhaps the most predictable? It was. People thought it was well deserved. She is a very talented actress and she really angered the movie. It’s a story, in many ways, about love and how love in any shape and form can have a transformative effect. She was in many senses a provider of love in that family, that was to be dead. Yes, a lot of people were hoping she would win and, as you said, she gave quite a fiery acceptance speech in favour of women’s rights. It began as one of those beaches where you thought she would mention everyone she knew, by way she was banking. At a very talented and authentic performer. -- thanking. Comparing Grand Budapest Hotel with a film like Boyhood, how beautiful it would be if we could create gorgeous cinematography. -- protect. Couldn’t have been more different. I’m glad to see it then win that category of production design, a closet deserved it. You are right. What I thought was really good about this film is it is set at a time where you have all of these wondrous characters, but the world is about to be plunged into war. Fascism. So, there’s a lot of meaning going on and I think that’s what made it really work, as a Wes Anderson film. I couldn’t agree more. I always thought Wes Anderson was too decorative. But if you want to defend the world against Fascism you have to decide... He makes a point. How much do you think it is about timing? How well a film does at the Academy Awards? Because it came out in February or March last year. There are some fine performances. Do you think if it was released in November, had each been given an enormous campaign, it would have done much better? I think Ralph didn’t really good job -- did a really good job and should have been nominated over Benedict Cumberbatch. The Oscars is really about who wins on the red carpet. We’ve seen a lot of successes so far, some great outfits. How important is it to really make an impact, especially for the actresses, or for for the actresses, orfor designers? It has been interesting. Last year at the Oscars I believe Cate Blanchett realised that the red carpet was a bit sexist. That too much attention was being put on the women and what they were wearing. It has been interesting to see how this conversation plays out. But some of them looked absolutely dynamite. Cate Blanchett is one of my best dressed. She always looks elegant, but interesting. The academy will acknowledge that the red carpet, the glamour and attention is very important for the attention that it gets for the Oscars. Not everybody is fascinated by the minutiae of the films, the directors and cinematography, but the Glam gets them. That’s right. I was running around here for the other day for talking movies and we were doing a preview story about the Oscars and everyone was excited about the dresses. That tells you what a lot of people are interested in. I am dresses. That tells you what a lot of people are interested in. Iam no expert on fashion, but I thought the fashion this year were a little conservative and dull. I would have liked to have seen something ostentatious and daring, in good taste, and I didn’t see that. Have you? It has been years since people have taken gigantic risks. Nobody shows up in some random thing they thought -- they felt like wearing. But the Oscars are generally conservative. The Oppy academy seems to like it that day. But don’t we miss Cher and little bit, for wearing whatever she wanted? Thank you very much to both of you. We have a few big awards coming up. There could be very close. We are close to Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress, which are likely to come in the next few moments. Thank you very much indeed. With me is Louise Hosie, the BBC’s social media producer. Ona night On a night like this, an event of this scale, it will generate a lot of bars on social media. Do we know how many tweets have gone out about it? -- a lot of buzz. The Oscars are completely dominating the social media landscape at the moment. One of the most popular hashtags at the moment is Oscars 2015 and that appears to have been tweeted 1.5 million times. Still a lot of chatter going on about the Oscars. One of the issues that seems to have captured the attention all over the world, we can see this map showing where the hashtags are being used, but one issue that has captured the imagination of people is Patricia Arquette’s comments about wage equality for women. Yes, a lot of people are tweeting in support of her comments about wage equality, equality for women. We can have a look at some of those. Another one of President Obama’s advisers said: Meryl Streep, who was in the audience, and some other celebrities’ reactions have been captured and some of the photos have been on Twitter. It interesting how political chatter can get. On the red carpet people are talking about what people are wearing and what they look like. The other issue that seems to be trending is the absence of white faces. That’s right. When the Oscars nations are white and only nine who are not white. emergence of this hashtag and people tweeting about it. I am seeing a tweet here by an actor, asking where was Ioan tweet here by an actor, asking where wasIoan Rivers in the memorial mentions? That list of people they do of people who have passed away in the past year. That is being picked UP the past year. That is being picked up as well. Yes, that’s been picked up. About why she wasn’t mentioned. I suppose the other issue is the ask are more campaign, which was designed to get people thinking more about what the actresses have to say and what they think, what is an just white dress they are wearing. -- rather than. Yes, the focus in the past has always been on what especially the actresses are wearing. This hashtag has really picked up and is suggesting that perhaps women shouldn’t be asked such shallow questions, about what they are wearing, but they should be asked more in-depth questions. Reese Witherspoon is one of the people who has been tweeting about this in support of it. Thank you. And don’t forget you can go to our website for a closer look at the nominees. We’re live blogging the ceremony there and keeping you up to date with all the latest winners. Stay with us on BBC News.

Two former British Foreign Secretaries, Iack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, have been filmed in an undercover investigation apparently offering to use their positions and contacts to benefit clients in return for substantial payments. The families of three British teenage girls who’re thought to have left the UK to join the so-called Islamic State in Syria, have given emotional interviews asking their daughters to come home. Nothing’s been heard from Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abas since they flew to Turkey five days ago. On Sunday Amira’s father said he had no idea of her plans, and her last words to him were ‘Daddy I’m in a hurry’. Daniel Sandford has more. The families of the three missing East London teenagers this afternoon making a desperate appeal for them to come home. This is my niece... Benu Begum clutching photographs of her 15-year-old sister, Shamima, and her pyjamas. She didn’t take anything with her. We are kind of clinging on to the bits that we have. We want her to come home. If you watch this, baby, please come home. Mum needs you more than anything in the world. We want you home, we want you safe. Contact anybody and let them know that you need help. You are not in any trouble. If anyone has convinced you of anything, they are wrong. We love you more than anybody could ever love you. One of her Shamima’s best friends ran away to Syria in December and the family had discussed it then. In a conversation, I asked... At a young age, you want to know what is going through your child’s mind. And that made me ask, ""You wouldn’t do anything stupid like that, would you?"" She is a fan of Chelsea. She loves Chelsea very much. This is the father of the second missing 15-year-old, Amira Abase, a huge Chelsea fan. This was the teddy bear she gave her mother for Mother’s Day. When she left home on Tuesday morning, she told her family she was going to a wedding. Infact, she flew to Istanbul. REPORTER: Did she seem normal and was she behaving in a normal way? Absolutely normal. There were no signs that she was planning anything. Did she say goodbye in a normal way? YES, a l’IOl’lTlal way. She said, ""Daddy, I’m in a hurry."" Before Tuesday, had she started showing an interest in Syria? Was she talking a lot about humanitarian problems? The third missing girl is Everyone is hurting. We don’t know if you are safe, especially Mum. Find the courage in your heart to contact us and let us know that you are safe and you are OK. Five days on, the last sign of the girls was at Gatwick Airport on Tuesday morning. And still, no one knows if they have made it to their presumed destination, the self-styled Islamic State. Two former British foreign secretaries, who’re current members of the UK parliament, have referred themselves to the MP’s Standards Commissioner, overallegations of demanding cash for access. Labour’s Iack Straw, here on the left, and Conservative Conservative Sir Malcolm Rifkind were filmed by documentary makers who posed as staff of a fake Chinese firm. The two politicians are seen apparently offering their services for thousands of pounds. Both deny any wrongdoing. Our political editor Robin Brant has the details. both have been Foreign Secretary in the past. These allegations come from a sting operation carried out, effectively, by a programme called dispatches for Channel 4 in the UK, and the Daily Telegraph newspaper. They were filmed separately in an undercover operation by reporters posing as representatives of a made UP posing as representatives of a made up Chinese firm, seeking to recruit British politicians to advise it. In one clip, Iack Straw is heard about -- talking about how he can operate under the radar, and Malcolm Rifkind and another clip talks about how he can get access to British diplomats. He goes onto say that he does not get a salary, even though he a sitting MP. Iack Straw has suspended himself from the Labour Party tonight, there’s going to be an investigation almost certainly by the standards watchdog, that could take some months. In a detailed statement, Iack Straw has defended himself, both men have denied anything improper or any wrongdoing. both men have denied anything improper orany wrongdoing. He improper or any wrongdoing. He has said these discussions are about work that he would possibly do after he’s left Parliament, he is due to retire in May. He says he is mortified in ""being caught in this trap"". Malcolm Rifkind has told the BBC that he was only seeking to help with information that was already available to the public. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced plans to introduce tougher anti terrorism laws including a proposal to revoke the citizenship of those who fight overseas with extremist groups. The new proposals come two months after a gunman who claimed to be an Islamic State supporter held 18 people hostage in cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed in the police raid that followed. Here’s what the Prime Minister had to say. We know that these are testing times for everyone here and for everyone sworn to protect our democratic freedoms. The terrorist threat is rising at home and abroad and is becoming harder to combat. Today, I can confirm that the government will be taking action against hate preachers. This includes enforcing and strengthening our antiterrorism laws. It includes new programmes to challenge terrorist propaganda and to provide alternative online material based on Australian values. And it will include stronger prohibitions on vilifying, intimidating or inciting hatred. Let’s go back to our big story, the Oscars, that’s happening in Hollywood. We canjoin our correspondent Peter Bowes, he is covering it for us. Some interesting winners so far, including Best Documentary? Let’s talk about Citizenfour, as you say, it won the prize for best documentary. With me is the BBC’s Tom Brook, this is a film that you have locked into a lot. -- looked. It is about Edward Snowden? No surprise this film won, it was incredible. What the filmmaker did, she was in a hotel room in Hong Kong with Edward Snowden, when he was in the process of revealing what he knew about the surveillance activities of various entities in the United States. Edward Snowden being the former NSA contractor. It was the biggest intelligence leak in many years. So, she well put together dumb Comanche film. She will be happy this has asked him initially, he was extremely reluctant. Now he says that he is very grateful that she persuaded him. It is an incredible public relations coup for him. To have a filmmaker make a film that wins an Oscar about a character who was viewed in polarised terms by a large number of people. In this country, a survey showed that one in every two Americans view him as a traitor. It really does help your cause, in a way, to have the endorsement of the Academy. Leading into the announcement of the best film score, that has been won by the Grand Budapest Hotel, there was a touching moment on stage to mark the 50th anniversary. Lady Gaga performed ""the Hills are alive"" from the Sound of music. She was embraced byIulie Andrews. It is unique to the Oscars. It is clever in terms of audience reach. We have people who know who Iulie Andrews is, audience reach. We have people who know whoIulie Andrews is, who know who Iulie Andrews is, who are over 60, and drawn to the entertainment, and a younger generation, they really like Lady Gaga. It was a nice bringing together of two very different talents. You cannot imagine two entertainers more unlike one another in a way. Although they did embrace, that made it very nice. It did work as a great Oscars moment. This is something the Academy constantly strives for. We hear about the audience demographics. It’s amazing this year, there have been a few moments that have briefly fallen flat? That is true, the verdict is still out. The fellow who is trying to hold it together, Neil Patrick Harris, he does not seem to have found his group. It is a real challenge to make it her cast work. Thank you. We have the big awards to come, best picture in a few minutes -- telecast. Thank you. This is BBC News. Hello there. After a wet and windy Sunday, it will be windy on Monday and it will feel cold. But most of us should see some sunshine between the wintry showers, of which there will be plenty. Low pressure in charge and the winds are strong. Those strong winds actually help to keep temperatures in most towns and cities above freezing first thing. But it will feel bitterly cold this Monday morning. Plenty of snow showers working into Scotland about 200 metres, but it could hit low levels. Across England and Wales, many places will start the working week with sunshine. But it will feel bitter. There will be some showers across central and southern parts of England and Wales, snow over the tops of the hills and mountains, but at lower levels, you might see sleet or get one or two hail showers. The showers will keep coming through the day. Yes, there will be spells of sunshine, quite a lot through eastern areas, but there will be a blustery wind throwing showers across all areas. Quite a bit of snow by the end of the day across north-west Scotland. Temperatures will reach five to eight degrees, but don’t forget that wind. It will make it feel much, much colder. It will feel about freezing in most places because of the icy wind, which continues to blow on Monday evening, if you are going out. Showers may fade in some areas, but keep going in Scotland and Northern Ireland, snow on the hills. Showers return later in the night, across more southern parts of the UK. Why so windy and wintry? Well, low pressure is dominating. The low slowly starts to pull away on Tuesday. A lot of isobars still on the chart, so blustery, but as it ebbs away, showers will fade. Tuesday afternoon offers more sunshine and fewer showers. There will still be some snow showers coming in across northern and western parts of Scotland over the hills. More snow showers to come in northern England, too. Temperatures a bit higher but still it will feel cold. There will be a bitter wind blowing. The low finally clears on Tuesday night and the isobars open a little. That allows things to turn frosty before an approaching weather front brings in cloud and rain into western areas during the day. In the east, a dry and bright day on Wednesday. After a frosty start, temperatures go up to seven or eight degrees. Temperatures further west could get up to nine or ten degrees, but there will be wet weather coming in. And throughout the week ahead, strong winds, often wet, and on Monday, feeling cold. Goodbye. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Ben Bland. The Oscars are under way in Simmonds for his role as an abusive music professor in Whiplash. Best Supporting Actress went to Patricia Arquette and the award for Best Foreign Language Film went to Ida, by the Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski. Two former British Foreign Secretaries have been filmed in an undercover investigation, apparently offering to use their positions and contacts to benefit companies in return for substantial payments. Both men have strongly denied any wrongdoing and referred themselves to the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards. The families of three British schoolgirls, thought to be heading to Syria to join Islamic State have appealed for them to come home. The girls, who attended the same school in east London, told their parents they were going out for the day. Now on BBC News, extratime. Welcome. Al-Qassam today is a Palestinian, who was on and out of his home as a young boy, spent three years inIordan but then his home as a young boy, spent three years in Iordan but then found years inIordan but then found his way to the UK by a Kuwaiti. -- years inIordan but then found his way to the UK bya Kuwaiti.-- Our guest today. He then set out to make a fortune. What’s that got to do with sport? Two years ago he took on the ownership of the Salford would devils and now he has ambitions to expand into Australia. -- Red Devils. He is also one of the country’s most successful racehorse owners. We’re about to find out what drives Marwan Koukash. Welcome. As a young boy, bombed out of his family home on the West Bank, how does he find himself being a multimillionaire and a serious move and shake into sports? Everyjourney has a start and it all started back probably in Palestine where as a young boy I grew up in a village, very simple existence. No water, no electricity, nothing. But the start of 67, we became refugees where we have to walk for days to get to safety. That taught me quite a lot. Do you remember the safety. That taught me quite a lot. Do you rememberthe bombing Do you remember the bombing of the house? I do Do you remember the bombing of the house? Ido remember the bombings of the village. We have never seen any aeroplanes before. Because of the simple existence of the village. Nobody had access to news, et cetera, and I doubt we had seen an aeroplane BBS to that. All of a sudden dizzy air planes coming in and bombing, it’s very scary. -- to see their planes. You have to leave, the whole village was destroyed. Most of it, yes. When the time came to leave the West Bank, how did you manage? You walk. You walk over mountains, down valleys, et cetera, until you get to the RiverIordan. From there you will reach safety. It was a refugee camp? Again, a very simple existence and it gives you the chance to start rebuilding your life. For me, rebuilding my life was all about going to school and working very hard in order to get a decent education, it was that’s the only way that I was going to succeed and make something of myself. That was inIordan, or in Kuwait? It started inIordan. There was a large influx of refugees coming from Palestine into Iordan. influx of refugees coming from Palestine intoIordan. Obviously you see that now. You have two -- you have two go to school, but there couldn’t find space with 200,000 children who came across, you have to do afternoon sessions. At that point violence was never far from your life. I read you describe yourself once as a boy soldier? What happens, I am sure many viewers would be aware of this, that between 67 and 1970 there was a law established in order to try to get the homeland back. But then it became almost like a state within a state inIordan. It caused some friction, and everybody knew eventually that you had to. .. friction, and everybody knew eventually that you had to... There was going to be a civil war. Everybody have to look after themselves. When he told the rugby league .com website that if he didn’t shoot you would get shot yourself, that suggests to me that you did shoot. You did? We all have two. What was that like? Did you take a life? We all have to look after ourselves. Yes. This is a disturbing memory for you, after ourselves. Yes. This is a disturbing memory foryou, I suspect? Not a pleasant memory. But it was a fight for survival? Exactly. If he didn’t fight for your survival, I wouldn’t be here. How did you emerge from that, psychologically and physically? It disturbs you. have to see the mutilated bodies. I’ve seen a scene so horrific, when you see for example a tank that’s gone over a body and you see the body on the street, that really gives you nightmares for a long time to come. I remember I couldn’t go to sleep in the dark -- in a dark room until maybe in my late teens, because of the horrible images. Have those memories, I can tell they haven’t entirely gaunt... -- entirely gone... They never go completely, but sometimes you learn to block it off your mind and think of something else. Would you say it has hardened your heart? I’m not sure if it has hardened my heart but it made me more ambitious and made me work harder, in order to achieve mY me work harder, in order to achieve my goals. It was obviously these were very fickle -- ethical times. Exactly. It taught me one thing, for sure. When people ask me, what’s the secret of success? I say it is having the need to succeed. And then of course the drive and ambition. Absolutely. Once you have that, you need to work. I keep saying to everyone that if you have a goal in life make sure you work every minute of the day, every minute of the hour, every hour of the day. If there’s anything you can do before you go to sleep in order to achieve that goal, do it before you go to sleep. It’s more important to work, and even to sleep. But life isn’t all about work, there’s a bit of play in there? Once you get some targets in life, you start to enjoy life. Let’s take this conversation to a brighter period of your life. You went to Kuwait after that, your education developed in the UK. You became a doctor of philosophy. These were very formative and interesting here is? Yes. It all started when I came to London in 76. -- interesting years. But you wanted to go to the US? Yes. I had the American dream! When you come to England, it’s like an old town. In 76, my uncle was supposed to meet me at Heathrow to look after me, but I ended up eating on my own. I checked into this hotel and said to this guy, like a bed-and-breakfast, where can I go? He said go to Piccadilly Circus. I went there, looking for animals, inking it was a circus, but I saw a different type of animal. -- thinking. It was a very conservative society. You could see different things. Let me bring you the -- let me bring things up to date. You took some extraordinary steps about two years ago to buy the Salford Red Devils. Why was that? You had only seen two matches before in your life. I enjoyed it and I’m not sure whether my good friend let me into it. You met him on a plane? I did. He said to me, there’s a club available. I remember rushing back from Dubai, where we were on a family holiday... You saved them from administration? I did. In Italy two days the club would have disappeared. -- in literally. It was a big challenge, to love big challenges. You bought the club in 2013 and they were 10th. Are you concerned you’ve bought a start? I knew things were going to be easy. -- bought a dud. It’s hard. But I will get there. I am very determined. The more people tell me thatit determined. The more people tell me that it can’t be done, the harder I will work to make it work. Except you waddled a bit, recently, when you send a message out on Twitter you said"" I’ve had enough"", which people took to mean you had had enough of Salford. The night before you were heavily defeated late St Helens. What was that with about? You reversed quickly out of it. It was a very emotional day, even before rugby things weren’t going well, and I was a little bit disappointed also with the crowd, pointing to what I was doing pre-season and so on. You weren’t supported by the fans? The fans didn’t turn up on the night. When you look over the past three months you will find out I am probably one of the hardest, is not the hardest, chairman in supporting the club. Everybody assumed it’s because of the performance of the boys. No, the boys gave it their best shot and I went into the dressing room and rather than giving them what I normally do I shook their hands and I said"" -- I said... normally do I shook their hands and Isaid"" -- I said... I didn’t normally do I shook their hands and I said"" -- I said... I didn’t say I was fully committed, that time I was thinking about walking away. What do you say to the players when they put out inflammatory or controversial text messages or Twitter postings? It isn’t an especially wise thing to do, is it? I’m very close to the boys. One of our boys did that and I told him off and made sure... But do they say, ""look, bass, you did it. He They didn’t know what I meant at the time. Was there another angle to I would have never walked away from the club entirely and leave it to struggle. But maybe the debt, their involvement, it was getting too much to me. During the deal, like I said, people assumed that as chairman I would only watch the game and leave at ten or 11. I’m different. I spend time in the local community, working to promote the game and I work quite a lot. I worked to promote rugby league. When things weren’t going as well as I hoped for, it really knocked me over. We’re all humans and sometimes we do say I’ve had enough. Living on. Let’s talk about Tim Sheens. There’s been a lot of spec elation that he might be joining, the Australian national coach. -- speculation. Yourties with Australia are well- known. What can you tell us about that? As you mentioned earlier on, I’ve only been involved in the league about two years. I’m still in office. Sometimes you need people you can trust. -- still a novice. For a task. Especially if they are experts in the field that you are seeking advice in. Tim is a great mate of mine. He’s going to come overfor a few weeks to look at the structures in the club, the systems, and suggest changes. Where does that leave your present coach? He’s the head coach. He says the head coach for the time being at least? He’s the head coach. I think I know where you’re coming from. I read that you don’t have a board and you won’t have a board, either. It’s about you, isn’t it, Salford? Ido have a board, either. It’s about you, isn’t it, Salford? I do have you, isn’t it, Salford? Ido have a board. It’s a board of one person? No, it’s made of fans. There are 12 fans who have been elected to the board and they are the board members. OK. Do they advise you... May be at the moment this is not for you but what about team selection? Do you involve yourself in that? You don’t know much about rugby league but it must be tempting as the owner to get involved in that. It is tempting. I will say that much, it’s tempting, but I don’t. OK. Let’s talk about the salary cap. I know that’s a bugbear with you. The salary cap is like making our super league second class condition to the NRL, which is the Australian version. In many ways we are seen as the breeding ground to producing rugby players in orderfor the breeding ground to producing rugby players in order for them to disappear to rugby union, the cost both conditions -- competition is have higher salaries. Rugby league players can play for about 15 years. We need to earn as much money as they can, so I can’t blame them. I have a young and talented player in Salford who wants to go to Australia to earn more money. The only way you to Eal’Iâ1 TT’Iol’E TT’IOI’1Ey. Ti’1E oI’lly way yOU Cal’] to earn more money. The only way you can stop that or even reverse it by increasing the salary cap. People talk about if you increase the salary cap you risk some clubs going into bankruptcy. ~ I will read you the regulations from Super League, they say it is to protect the integrity of the Super League, and that it is based on field sporting merit, not feel financial considerations. How do you react? It appears to be a sound principle on paper. Does it? Explain to me why it isn’t, then. For me, increasing the salary cap is not only going to stop our talent leaving, but it will reverse it. You have to bring in the likes of Williams into the competition. Someone like him is going to ensure all will make sure that wherever he plays, he is going to have 1000 new fans going into the ground to watch him. I understand, as I said earlier, that not all of the clubs will be able to afford the increased salary cap, but they do not spend it now. It was £1.8 million, as it is now. Why not increase it to 2.5, £3 million? It won’t make a difference to the clubs that are not spending their current salary cap. You don’t look it will mean that we could clubs will disappear? No. It won’t. Not at all. Let’s talk about your Australian ambitions. They are too prominent, there is the British Bulldogs concept, that is that you would construct a team to play in the Australian league, for something like three months during their season. All of those would be away games, I think I’m right in saying. Once a week, or however frequent it is, they would come over to the UK, and play their away games on British soil. That is a very interesting and imaginative idea, how will that work? If it comes to fruition? This is all down to the Australians, if they ever decide to increase the competition, and if they would ever consider using or allowing an English club to come in. Why would it be in their interest to do that? To grow the competition and Rugby League. You mentioned the fact that the team would go over there for three months of the year. And the British Bulldogs would host an Australian side every week over here. Now, they don’t have to play every week here in England. Some of the games would be played in Dubai. Some would be played in Europe. It becomes an international game? Yes, thatis becomes an international game? Yes, that is promoting Rugby League internationally. Do you have the slightest inkling that this will happen? What kind of encouragement have you been given by Australian authorities? I think what we have to do, we have to decide if we want to increase the competition. If they want to increase the competition from 16 to 18 teams, plus if they are willing to listen to one of those, two coming from England. At the moment, it seems very rather than practice -- to come in. I have to be ready. To put an application together. I have to start working with that application immediately. So, more likely may be, you seem rather another Dopfer Australia. And of Australian rugby league, -- rather enamoured of Australia. I love the competition. It is the best in the world. I’m not devaluing... That I’m not respectful of our competition of Rugby League, but it is the best competition. I would love to be part of it. Yes. Who do you have your eyes on at the moment to buy in Australia? It depends! Now we have the man himself, we don’t have to read the papers, tell us! Do you really think I’ll tell you? Probably not, but it is worth asking! The answer is I will not tell you! Nevertheless, that seems like more of Agulla, it is a better prospect than maybe the British Bulldogs idea. -- more of a -goer. If I think the British Bulldogs idea... I am working on another front. This suggests to me, we have described the Super League as a feeder to Australian rugby league. There is a quote somewhere, you said the people running the game in this country were like dinosaurs, that they do not have modern ideas, they are not forwardthinking, is that an apt description of the authorities? Yes. Why would you say that specifically? They are not willing to change, there is a lot that can be done, the salary cap is one of them. Yes, part of that might be their failure over the decades, never mind the years, to expand the game in the UK. Exactly, a lot of people who entered the game now are happy to keep it. Where I think there is a huge potentialfor the sport to be taken beyond... Listen, for me... I’ve said it many times, Rugby Union is the biggest threat to Rugby League. It is very successful. Rugby Union try to expand the sport, come up with different products, thatis come up with different products, that is what we should be copying. But you don’t like Rugby Union very much, do you? They pinch the players from Rugby League. They’ve been professional for 20 years. It is like natch -- National hunt racing. lump like natch -- National hunt racing. Iump horses are big and slow committee went on Twitter with that? I stand by that. Rugby League is a faster game. Like flat racing, it is a lot faster. Let’s talk a little bit about racing. You are regarded, I think, as the most successful owner in the UK. That takes us back to Australia. You definitely want to try to win the Melbourne cup? I’ve been involved in racing. Years now. I accepted an invitation from my bank manager-- in racing I accepted an invitation from my bank manager -- in racing for seven years now. I went to the races and enjoyed the social side of it. I ended up buying a horse two weeks later and we put it in a race where it was the favourite. It was not going to be beat. Inviting my friends and family to that race, it gave me... If I take it back to rugby, my first game we lost 42 -0, that makes me more determined to succeed. By finishing last, I did not give up. I needed to work harder. Let’s get a newsline out of you for the racing fans watching, are you going to enter a horse into the Melbourne cup this year? 100%. 100%? Yes. Which one? It is likely to be Duke of Clarence, a horse that, I think, to be Duke of Clarence, a horse that, Ithink, highly. If Mount Everest recovers from his injury, he for the Melbourne cup. So, a final thought from you, whether it is talk about football, you are an all-round sportsman. I love sport! You do love sport. What drives you forward? Succeeding. When you set the target, success is sweeter than other successes. the target, success is sweeter than othersuccesses. It other successes. It depends what difficult to get you set yourself. One day, I will be delighted when I walk in front of my team -- target. For the challenge cup. As an owner, you get to walk into Wembley, that is a big target. That will be huge, give me huge satisfaction. When it comes to racing, and one race now short of 400 winners. It has always been my dream to get 500 winners before I finish in racing. It is a very difficult target. I think I will achieve that quite soon. Well, I certainly wish you well. Marwan Koukash, thank you forjoining us on the programme. Thank you. Hello there. After a wet and windy Sunday, it will be windy on Monday and it will feel cold. But most of us should see some sunshine between the wintry showers, of which there will be plenty. Low pressure in charge and the winds are strong. Those strong winds actually help to keep temperatures in most towns and cities above freezing first thing. But it will feel bitterly cold this Monday morning. Plenty of snow showers working into Scotland about 200 metres, but it could hit low levels. Across England and Wales, many places will start the working week with sunshine. But it will feel bitter. There will be some showers across central and southern parts of England and Wales, snow over the tops of the hills and mountains, but at lower levels, you might see sleet or get one or two hail showers. The showers will keep coming through the day. Yes, there will be spells of sunshine, quite a lot through eastern areas, but there will be a blustery wind throwing showers across all areas. Quite a bit of snow by the end of the day across north-west Scotland. Temperatures will reach five to eight degrees, but don’t forget that wind. It will make it feel much, much colder. It will feel about freezing in most places because of the icy wind, which continues to blow on Monday evening, if you are going out. Showers may fade in some areas, but keep going in Scotland and Northern Ireland, snow on the hills. Showers return later in the night, across more southern parts of the UK. Why so windy and wintry? Well, low pressure is dominating. The low slowly starts to pull away on Tuesday. A lot of isobars still on the chart, so blustery, but as it ebbs away, showers will fade. Tuesday afternoon offers more sunshine and fewer showers. There will still be some snow showers coming in across northern and western parts of Scotland over the hills. More snow showers to come in northern England, too. Temperatures a bit higher but still it will feel cold. There will be a bitter wind blowing. The low finally clears on Tuesday night and the isobars open a little. That allows things to turn frosty before an approaching weather front brings in cloud and rain into western areas during the day. In the east, a dry and bright day on Wednesday. After a frosty start, temperatures go up to seven or eight degrees. Temperatures further west could get up to nine or ten degrees, but there will be wet weather coming in. And throughout the week ahead, strong winds, often wet, and on Monday, feeling cold. Goodbye. I’m Nuala McGovern.

Best Actor went to Eddie Redmayne for his role in The Theory of Everything. Let’s look at what happened and some of the winners so far. The best picture award is remaining. The top prize, Best Actor, Eddie Redmayne for his role in The Theory of Everything. The title of Best Actress went to Iulianne Moore for Still Alice. Moving to Best Director, the director of Birdman. IK Simmons wins Best Supporting Actor for the film Whiplash. And the award of Best Supporting Actress went to Patricia Arquette for the 12 year long role in the film Boyhood. Let’s move to the Foreign Language Film Category as the Polish black and white film Ida had top honours in that category. Our correspondent is in Hollywood, let’s get the latest. Those winning the biggest awards have just come in. How would you describe the night? It has been a great night. Especially forIulianne Moore. The last big winner in the last few minutes for best actress for Still Alice. She plays the Harvard professor who is suffering from early onset Alzheimer’s disease. Iulianne Moore is clearly delighted with her win. She started her speech by saying she read recently that winning an Oscar can add five years to your life and she hopes it does because she has a younger husband. She was in a really good mood. She dedicated her win the people suffering from Alzheimer’s. She said she hopes it raises the profile of a condition that many people who struggle with that condition feel they are isolated and a loan. She said she hopes this makes them feel they are not quite so alone and people understand what’s happening and perhaps eventually find a cure -- alone. Let’s get more analysis. From delighted. We expected her to win. It was delightful to see her. She is one of the best in Hollywood and I’m so glad she has been recognised. Recognised for a tough role. This wasn’t an easy character to play. She played a 50-year-old woman with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. She had to convey changes in cognitive function. As an actress, that’s a real challenge. It’s notjust how you move its what’s going on inside your mind. What she liked about this film, I interviewed her not long ago, is that it told of the condition through the eyes of the person who had it. That’s quite unusual. It wasn’t from an outside point of view. Tremendous performance. Lots would agree with me in saying the performance was better than the film. Some people found the film a bit routine. Respectable. However, she soared in this film. I spoke to her at the Oscar nominees luncheon and she said she heard from so many with early-onset Alzheimer’s and it gave them a lift to see their condition and their feelings portrayed them a lift to see their condition and theirfeelings portrayed on and their feelings portrayed on the big screen. It is true and notjust as a victim but as a vibrant, complicated, interesting woman taking control of the situation. Birdman has been announced as best picture. -- Best Picture. It was always between Birdman and boy -- Boyhood. The evening belongs to Birdman. It got four Oscars trophies altogether. Boyhood, Ifeel Birdman. It got four Oscars trophies altogether. Boyhood, I feel badly about. When people look back in ten years for the definitive American film of this particular time, they will look to Boyhood. Birdman had great technique - Brilliant acting and directing was fantastic. It was all short as if in one take. You cannot fault the film. I felt a good map was more impressive, more original, more human and more powerful emotionally -- Boyhood. Many might have had doubts about the end result because of what went into it. This was a film inspired by didn’t get Best Director. I thought they would have awarded to get his cast and editor year after year. to get his cast and editor year afteryear. -- after year. -- for the idea and perseverance. Both films are stunts of the sort. One is very long, one is a long take. It seems that the Academy Awards like the trickery of that, however, they like Birdman more. Best Actor - Eddie Redmayne - many predicted that. It could have gone to Michael Keaton. It went to the British actorfor gone to Michael Keaton. It went to the British actor for the Theory of Everything. He put everything into that performance. It was an excellent performance. He spent time with people who had motoneuron disease. Really, actually, invested himself wholeheartedly in it and it showed. We commented earlier- he acquitted himself very well during the campaign. He could have alienate people. He was very charming. Not in a superficial way -- alienate it. I was timed by him in a genuine way andl was timed by him in a genuine way and I think you have been as well. He has given very good acceptance speeches -- alienated. Unfortunately, I missed his tonight a few moments ago however, he is very talented. I caught some of it - he was humble and grateful and seemed a little taken aback. He wasn’t showing off in any sort of way. That shows his character. It is true. Between his award and Iulianne Moore’s, we will see the best picture contenders for the actors playing someone with a crippling disease. It is working for everyone stop leap it goes back to Daniel Day Lewis and My Left Foot. He was up against Tom Cruise in a wheelchair performance. I wish Tom Cruise took that. That’s always the issue. The academy reflects the issues and films and rarely the Luck -- blockbusters - American sniper did nothing. That is an exception because it did very well at the American box office -- Sniper. Not recognised at the academy. The best picture contenders -5 of eight are biopic about white men. At least American sniper falls into that category. Much has been conveyed about how that reflects the voter ship of the academy. The academy likes to project sophistication, being above commerce, they don’t want to be sullied by commerce. Films that do commercially well, they don’t reward with trophies. Let’s have a word about the show. It isn’tjust Let’s have a word about the show. It isn’t just about the winners or losers, it is about the ceremony, one of the most watched shows off the calendar year, Super Bowl being the biggest. Was it a stellar awards? It was a man who worked in theatre. He is a real-life magician. At one point, this man ended up in his underpants on the Oscars stage. That sums it up. What are they trying to do? It is a very difficult situation. Trying to hard? How do you reach an audience? They had Ellen Degeneres to take a selfie that nearly broke the whole of the Internat -- international internet system. I am surprised we didn’t see that trickery. It was tough for Neil Patrick Harris. I didn’t know where history is or going. It felt like an old-fashioned, safe... You can almost picture it a team of 80-year-old jokesters writing his material. He is good at what he does best - song material. He is good at what he does best- song and dance. It was a great start. And if he could AdLib or respond spontaneously, he was fine, however, there was overwriting hy fine, however, there was overwriting by committee. Thank you both. That is the Oscars for another year. Some surprises but most of the awards went as critics predicted. Thank you very much. From a rainy evening in Los Angeles, that’s quite unusual, and all of those big awards coming in in the last few minutes. With me is Louise Hosie, the BBC’s social media producer. Louise, it’s the biggest night of the year for the film industry, how’s it playing out on social media? What struck you first? Social media... The Oscars has dominated social media over the last couple of hours with a number of different hashtags trending. One is # Oscars 2015. Today that was tweeted 2 million times. That gives you a sense of the amount of people on their phones, tablets, involved in treating. One hashtag that struck me - # ask are more. This is a hashtag in response to women on the red hearted with the suggestion that some of the questions they are asked as being a bit shallow and a plea to be asked more intelligent questions -- # ask her now. There was a moment that struck me that has been reprinted many times, that’s when Patricia Arquette, who got Best Supporting Actress for boyhood, the film they were arguing about whether it should have been Best Film, she talked about it has been a main talking point. inequality, the issue has been picked up by Twitter. We are WE aI’E SCI’EaTT’IiIâ1g because Patricia Arquette speech was more incredible than imagine -- Patricia Arquette’s speech. The adviser to President Obama tweeted: ~ I have had a look at the a number of times Patricia Arquette’s name has been mentioned -320,000 times since making the speech of. Also with that, I am not sure whether you will have seen this not, the camera focused on Meryl Streep and Iennifer Lopez who were seated beside each other. They basically went fist pumping and supporting Patricia Arquette as she gave their speech. That clip seems to have gone viral. It did and it is doing the rounds on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and it will be one of the most tweeted images. And with this of course, since you have been sitting with me at we heard from Peter, best actor, best actress, Best Film comes in, do you think how popular it becomes on social media gives it a boost of films and actors involved. It does and what is interesting is sometimes on Twitter the films people speak about and the actors and actresses are not always those that go to win. This year, Selma was talked about a lot. That could go back to when the nominations came out in Ianuary. back to when the nominations came out inIanuary. There was a hashtag, # Oscars so white. 118 nominees are white and only nine are nonwhite. That # has been tweeted and spoken about today’s. -- that hashtag has been tweeted. What do you take away from this? Content with lusty it doesn’t seem to have the same buzz. I am not sure if Neil Patrick Harris managed to get it going and that has been reflected on Twitter. Looking back last year, you had Ellen’s selfie which did very well. Thejury had Ellen’s selfie which did very well. The jury is still out. That was mentioned by our Gast, Neil Patrick Harris, when I scrolled through some called for it. Tina Fey bought Ellen Degeneres, we will see what happens next year -- or.

And it will include stronger prohibitions on vilifying, intimidating or inciting hatred.

They have agreed that they will come to an agreement about the new agreement, basically, by the sounds of things. There is a long way ahead.

They were losing deposits, they were at the mercy of the ECB. At least now they have bought some time and hopefully they can have an agreement in the next few days.

The article also reports on cracks within Greece’s ruling party. American fund managers are looking to shift money towards stocks in Europe and Asia. The Wall Street Iournal reports that the managers hope overseas stocks will show bigger gains. The US Financial Times looks at a new opportunity for foreign investors interested in China.

The traditional red envelopes usually given are now being sent on a social networking app. That’s in the China Daily. Ioining us is Bronwyn Curtis, from the official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum. She’s the chief economic advisor there. Thank you forjoining us. Good morning. Let us begin with our first story in the Daily Telegraph. The two former British Foreign -- two foreign secretaries involved in these allegations of cash for access. This was a set up on behalf of a fictitious Chinese company. But remember, the Daily Telegraph, they broke the story about the Parliamentary expenses scandal. And that went on and on and on and I think that they see this as an extension of that sort of thing. It is coming up to a large election and there are lots of stories in the newspapers all the time. One of theseis newspapers all the time. One of these is Labour and the other is conservative. And there is a chance that people will think, oh, I will not vote for either of the big parties, and it might send people out to the fringe parties, which is not really what you would want, but both of them have referred themselves to the Parliamentary standards committee themselves. I’m sorry, the parliamentary commission what standards. -- the parliamentary commissionerfor standards. day. It is, of course, a very big story in the UK. The Guardian has another investigation. The Guardian says it has seen files that show that the chief executive of HSBC sheltered some £5 million using a Panamanian company and a Swiss account. HSBC is releasing its annual results today and I imagine they really wanted a good news story today. Not this one. I think that they were hoping to move on. This has beenjust they were hoping to move on. This has been just about HSBC. There they were hoping to move on. This has beenjust about HSBC. There have been no other banks involved and it has gone on and on and on. In some ways, it is not a news story because we have known about Swiss bank accounts for some time. Ido have some sympathy with him on one point. He was in Hong Kong for a long time and... He is domiciled the. He really did not want people in the -- he is domiciled there. He really did not want people at his business to know what he is bonus was. There are reasons for perhaps not keeping things domestic. However, this story has come at a time that is really an helpful. As HSBC is being investigated anyway on several levels for previous that they have drawn a line under this. care? Are more -- or do they shareholders not care? I think that they would very much like to draw a line under it. They will not be happy when they see that headline. The International New York Times. Greece seeks last-minute changes to avoid default. ‘s you have been watching Greece very closely. What about this particular story? I don’t think the twists and turns are really over yet. These are the last minute changes to avoid default. Lee problem is that the party embrace -- the problem is that the party in the country is fragmented. They came in on an anti-austerity programme. And it is the detail between what the European Commission wants, what they think they can get through domestic league... I think there are lots of twists and turns. The sole concession to Athens was to allow it to propose changes to the requirements of its creditors. You can make changes for the overall plan has to stay the same. And we don’t know what the detail is. Those who voted in Syriza, they don’t know either. They have to deliver on the promises they made to the people who voted them in. I think the fractures within the party is an interesting aspect of it because we have not heard that previously. It has been about trying to get the concessions from the eurozone. We will stay with the markets. The lure of US money is an issue that is coming up in the Wall Street journal. Where to an issue that is coming up in the Wall Streetjournal. Where to put your money. Of course, everybody has been talking about the US. A lot of money has gone into the US stock market, so it now looks very expensive and Europe looks very cheap. And they are looking to take advantage of that. Warren Buffett, of course, a couple of days ago, his company for the first time bought the German motorcycle gear making company. Even he has moved in. There is this theme throughout our papers about where the money is going . And in Greece, we were looking at the amount of money taken out of the Greek economy and put into other European countries. 2 billion euros per week coming out of Greece. And an entire billion euros came out on Friday, I understand. The Financial Times is looking at trees but they are also looking at shortselling limits. -- the FinancialTimes are also looking at shortselling limits. -- the Financial Times is looking at Greece. Change in Shanghai. What is this about? Foreign investors now will be able to do shortselling of Chinese shares from next month. That means that you can take a bet on whether or not shares will fall. Notjust buy them and wait for them to rise or fall. You can take a bet on the falling. They are opening up very carefully because you are only allowed to short 1% per day or 5% for the week, which is absolutely tiny, which is what this article is about. That is why it is being criticised. Baby steps? They move on these regulations all the time. They clamped down recently on margin trading. It had got out of control. It can be very risky. They are opening up a head at a time. If it works, they will probably do more. And the China Daily is also talking about money. This time, holiday cash presents. During the Lunar New there are often gifts of money. And now, a social media twist. Yes. allowing people to send money on their mobile phones. If they shape the -- shake the devices. And at one point, 11 billion individual shakes. That is a lot of money! Hello there. After a wet and windy Sunday, it will be windy on Monday and it will feel cold. But most of us should see some sunshine between the wintry showers, of which there will be plenty. Low pressure in charge and the winds are strong. Those strong winds actually help to keep temperatures in most towns and cities above freezing first thing. But it will feel bitterly cold this Monday morning. Plenty of snow showers working into Scotland about 200 metres, but it could hit low levels. Across England and Wales, many places will start the working week with sunshine. But it will feel bitter. There will be some showers across central and southern parts of England and Wales, snow over the tops of the hills and mountains, but at lower levels, you might see sleet or get one or two hail showers. The showers will keep coming through the day. Yes, there will be spells of sunshine, quite a lot through eastern areas, but there will be a blustery wind throwing showers across all areas. Quite a bit of snow by the end of the day across north-west Scotland. Temperatures will reach five to eight degrees, but don’t forget that wind. It will make it feel much, much colder. It will feel about freezing in most places because of the icy wind, which continues to blow on Monday evening, if you are going out. Showers may fade in some areas, but keep going in Scotland and Northern Ireland, snow on the hills. Showers return later in the night, across more southern parts of the UK. Why so windy and wintry? Well, low pressure is dominating. The low slowly starts to pull away on Tuesday. A lot of isobars still on the chart, so blustery, but as it ebbs away, showers will fade. Tuesday afternoon offers more sunshine and fewer showers. There will still be some snow showers coming in across northern and western parts of Scotland over the hills. More snow showers to come in northern England, too. Temperatures a bit higher but still it will feel cold. There will be a bitter wind blowing. The low finally clears on Tuesday night and the isobars open a little. That allows things to turn frosty before an approaching weather front brings in cloud and rain into western areas during the day. In the east, a dry and bright day on Wednesday. After a frosty start, temperatures go up to seven or eight degrees. Temperatures further west could get up to nine or ten degrees, but there will be wet weather coming in. And throughout the week ahead, strong winds, often wet, and on Monday, feeling cold. Goodbye. You know, you’re not a victim. You’re a failure. As a wife, as a mother.

Good Afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Two former Foreign Secretaries, jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, deny they’ve done anything wrong, after being secretly filmed by the Daily Telegraph and Channel lI’s Dispatches programme, offering their services to a private company for thousands of pounds. Both men have referred themselves to the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards, and both men are now suspended Here’s our Political Correspondent Vicky Young. Two senior experienced MPs who probably should have known better. jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind thought they were discussing what paid advice they could give a Chinese company, but it was a sting operation. I am self-employed. So nobody pays me a salary. I have to earn my income. But when I’m not doing something, I can do what I like. Mr Straw met the undercover reporters in his office in the House of Commons and talked about work he’d done for other companies. Obviously, there’s, if we get down the track, there’s the issue of what fee. Of course. I don’t know if you have a kind of daily rate in mind. Normally, if I’m doing a speech or something, it’s £5,000 a day, that’s what I charge. Have the men broken any rules? MPs are prohibited from taking money to speak or vote in the Commons. But they are allowed to be paid for outside interests, as a company director, consultant or adviser. Any earnings must be declared in a register of members’ interests. Some have suggested all this has security implications because Sir Malcolm Rifkind chaired the Parliamentary Committee which oversees Britain’s intelligence agencies, but he insists he’s got nothing to be embarrassed about. These are sordid, unfounded allegations. I am going to fight them all the way. Of course I had a salary as an MP but in terms of business interests, I don’t get a salary. I get paid for the work I provide for individual companies. Mr Straw came out fighting. He is standing down as an MP in May and says although he’s mortified to have been tricked by reportersers, he’s simply using his experience to get anotherjob. I’ve complied with the letter and the spirit of the rules. This interview with, as it turned out, a bogus company set up by Channel 1+, was not to do with my work as a Member of Parliament, it was to do with whether I would work for them after I had retired. Sir Malcolm Rifkind and jack Straw may not have broken rules but it’s raised the issue of whether an MP should be allowed to do outside work while sitting as a member of the Commons. Steps have been taken to increase transparency, so voters know what MPs earn and crucially, who is paying them. But Labour say it’s time to go much further. Ed Miliband on a visit to Croydon today said he wants to limit the type of extra work MPs can do. Labour candidates standing at the next election would be banned from taking paid directorships or consultancies. Today I’m writing to David Cameron to say he should do the same for his Members of Parliament. We’ve got to settle this issue of second jobs once and for all so we remove any suspicion that MPs are working, not for their constituents’ interests, but someone else’s. What I see from the Labour proposal is actually not outlawing outside business or interests, but putting a new set of rules which would for instance allow someone to work as a Trade Union official but wouldn’t allow someone to run a family shop or a family publishing business or such like. I think that doesn’t make sense. This episode adds to the suspicion of some voters that MPs are in it for their own person gain, rather than to serve their communities. But the Prime Minister says Parliament can be enriched by MPs having outside interests, as long as they obey the rules. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor Norman Smith. Both men vehemently deny they have done anything wrong. An investigation is obviously under way, but none of this does the reputation of Parliament any good does it at a time when some people are saying they have lost faith in mainstream politics? Clive, I imagine the reaction of most people will be here we go again. MPs seemingly seeking to feather their own nest, rather than focussing on the danger of representing their own constituents. The paradox of course is that it doesn’t seem to me that they have actually breached Commons rules. Many, many MPs have paid Directorships and consultancies, workers, paid advisers, there’s nothing actually in the Commons rules that bar that. Of course, in the court of public opinion, it’s a different story, particularly when they hear MPs asking for £5,000 a day. That’s why I suspect the consequences for the MPs might be high in terms of their reputation and theirfuture high in terms of their reputation and their future prospects. and theirfuture prospects. These are two MPs who’ve had formidable political careers coming towards the twilight of them now, who face their reputations being tarnished, both have been suspended from their parties, both face investigations. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, if he isjudged to have breached party rules, could be barred from standing as an MP at the next election and I think there are growing questions as to whether he can remain as chairman of the intelligence committee. HSBC says it’s had a challenging year after reporting a 17% drop in annual pre-tax profits. They were down to just over £12 billion. The results follow allegations that the bank helped wealthy clients evade paying taxes. It’s a stain one of the biggest banks is finding hard to wipe off. Its association with Swiss bank accounts and customers not paying tax. Today, HSBC apologised again for conduct and compliance failures at its Swiss offshoot but couldn’t prevent another twist in the affair. The Spotlight’s now falling on HSBC’s Chief Executive, Stewart Gull very. He also had an account at the Swiss branch for his salary, though he said he’s never paid less than the maximum tax rate in the UK. His PHY the maximum tax rate in the UK. His pay package was £7. 6 million last year, including a smaller bonus but apparently no bonus reduction for what he called the shame that HSBC’s Swiss operation got. The bank’s had to respond to allegations of tax avoidance. Swiss banking operation put out a big statement in the newspapers and it will be a grave concern that now the focus is extending to executives, as well as the bank itself. HSBC’s discomfort has been increased by a surprising drop in profits, partly from difficult trading around the world over the last few months, but also from fines and compensation around allegations of manipulating the foreign exchange market and in the UK from misselling of payment protection insurance. The drop in profits went down badly in the stock market, HSBC’s shares falling more than 5%. On the Swiss activities, the bank says it’s overhauled the operation, but today, listed investigations under way in Belgium, France, Argentina, India and in Switzerland itself. Well with me is our business editor Kamal Ahmed. These profits or lack of them, they set the seal on a torrid year for Britain’s biggest bank? Certainly do. OK, £12 billion a year still £1 billion a month in profit, a bank which still has a very strong balance sheet but it’s important to the global economy to underestimate it. It has 250,000 employees, 1+7,000 employees in the UK alone. Stewart Gull very this morning on the conference call with the media suggested that there may be more shrinking for the bank which must be of concern for those employees. Also the cost of just of concern for those employees. Also the cost ofjust doing business now as a global bank has gone up hugely, UP as a global bank has gone up hugely, up % in 2011+, regulatory costs after the financial crisis and, of course as Simon said in his report, all the fines the bank’s faced, £2.1+ billion worth. Stewart Gull very went went some way toe explaining his rather complicated, although nevertheless didn’t break any rules on tax, his arrangements about Switzerland and Panama. He said he had got rid of the Panama structure over payments in the early 2000s and that the only reason for it was to keep things confidential, not to do anything about tax which he said he pays at the UK rate on all his earnings. Bethnal Green Academy in east London has re-opened after the half term break,with police continuing their investigation into the disappearance of three pupils thought to be heading for Syria to join Islamic State. Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase flew from Gatwick to Turkey on Tuesday. Our correspondent Daniel Sandford is at the academy. This was the first day back at Bethnal Green academy after the half-term break, a half-term in which the school was in the headlines for all the wrong reasons after three pupils apparently left the country seemingly to be on their way tojoin the the country seemingly to be on their way to join the self-styled Islamic state in Syria. Arriving at school this morning, the pupils of Bethnal Green academy, set in the heart of London’s multicultural East End. The school is rated outstanding by Ofsted. But it’s reeling from the revelation that this half-term, three bright teenage girls due to take their GCSEs this summer have run away to Turkey and seem to be heading for Syria. We are all shocked and deeply saddened by the news that three of our students have been reported missing from home. This situation follows an earlier disappearance of a student in December of last year. The police spoke to the student’s friends at that time and further to this, they indicated that there was no evidence that the girls were at risk of being radicalised or absconding. Parents dropping their children off said the school was not to blame. I think there’s an assumption made about a school in East London that’s attended by a lot of Muslim children. I think people are quick to blame schools for everything. The three girls flew out of Gatwick on Tuesday and no-one’s heard anything from them since. Shammia Begum has beenin from them since. Shammia Begum has been in touch with a Scottish woman already in Syria on Twitter. The assumption is that they’re trying tojoin her. This in exclusive BBC pictures is the border zone between Turkey and the part of Syria controlled by Islamic state. This weekend, in a town, there was little sign of any Turkish government control over the border. A people smuggler told us foreign women wanting to get into Syria are usually brought to the town by Turkish smugglers and handed over to IS fighters at the frontier. TRANSLATION: The handover’s always done on the border. It’s done in the presence of a woman, IS member, who waits with two IS fighters. But no-one the BBC spoke to in the town had seen the three British girls, so it’s possible they are still in Turkey. Police have been in the school this morning, as have members of the local prevent team, who work to try and stone the radicalisation of pupils, but it’s worth emphasising that the head teacher this morning said detectives had told him that there was no evidence that the three girls were radicalised here in the academy which means that any contact that there may have been between them and Islamist fighters in Syria presumably happened in the darker recesses of the Internet. David Cameron is promising to protect pensioner benefits, such as free bus passes and the winter fuel allowance, if the Conservatives wins the general election. He repeated a promise made at the last election, not to introduce means testing which would mean taking away the bus passes and winter fuel allowance. Ellie taking away the bus passes and winterfuelallowance. Ellie is winter fuel allowance. Ellie is in Westminster for us now. Is this an appeal to older voters? It’s an appeal that’s not a surprise, one David Cameron made back in 20 #10rks protection of the benefits, as you mentioned, like the TV licence, bus passes, winterfuel mentioned, like the TV licence, bus passes, winter fuel allowance, as well as free prescriptions and this at a time when Labour said they would means test the winter fuel allowance, the Liberal Democrats going further saying they would take it away from rich pensioners too. David Cameron says there’s a logic to it that cutting the benefits wouldn’t make great savings, that there’s not a lot of point in doing so when you count in the extra costs of the extra bureaucracy of the means testing, but there’s also people who question those numbers as well. When you take into account that pensioners benefits cost £100 billion every year, most of that is taken up with pensions themselves but £3 billion is taken up with the benefits we are talking about here and there are some that say when you look at the fact the Government says it wants to make £12 billion of cuts in the next Parliament, that the £3 billion of pensioners benefits here start to make a bit more sense. But there is a calculation in all this. These are messages that will appeal to older voters and it’s after all older people who’re more likely to vote on May 7th. Our top story this lunchtime: Two former foreign secretaries, jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, deny they’ve done anything wrong, after being secretly filmed by the Daily Telegraph and Channel 1+'s Dispatches programme, offering their services to a private company for thousands of pounds. And still to come: We’ll tell you why a new syringe that breaks after being used only once could save millions of lives. Coming up, Moeen Ali and Ian Bell shared an opening partnership of 172 as England won their first match of the Cricket World Cup. It’s Hollywood’s biggest night of the year and one of the biggest cheers at the 87th Academy Awards was for Britain’s Eddie Redmayne. Last night, he won Best Actor for his role as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. julianne Moore won Best Actress, playing a university professor with Alzheimer’s in Still Alice, and the film Birdman took the gong for Best Picture. Our Los Angeles correspondent, David Willis, has all the details. It is an evening of sumptuous glamour, the movie industry’s big night out. A night when Hollywood’s new arrivals get to rub shoulders with some of the biggest stars on the planet. And the Oscar goes to... Patricia Arquette. On a night of heartfelt speeches, Patricia Arquette set the ball rolling, using her Best Supporting Actress acceptance speech to appeal for greater rights for women. It is our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the United States of America. ""Yes,"" chanted fellow nominee Meryl Streep and other members of the star-studded audience. Five-time nominee julianne Moore was named Best Actress for her portrayal of a middle-aged woman battling early-onset Alzheimer’s disease in Still Alice. Leaving the award for Best Actor... The Oscar goes to Eddie Redmayne. Ever the favourite, Londoner Eddie Redmayne, who played Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, seemed almost totally overwhelmed. I am fully aware that I am a lucky, lucky man. This Oscar. .. Wow! Next up for Eddie Redmayne, resuming the honeymoon he postponed at the start of the awards season after marrying his teenage sweetheart just before Christmas. Then he is off to Cambridge to show his golden statuette to the man he immortalised on film, Professor Stephen Hawking. What was going through your mind when you stood on the stage, holding the Oscar? Show us it, show us it. It exists. It’s real. I couldn’t articulate it. It was like a frenzy of virtually every single human emotion possible, all in about 30 seconds. Birdman. Birdman, the story of a fading Hollywood star, took several of the top honours, including Best Film and Best Director for Alejandro Inarritu. # Climb every mountain... # 50 years since The Sound of Music, Lady Gaga channelled her inner julie Andrews to perform a medley of songs. None of this year’s films could compete with that one in terms of box-office takings, but if nothing else, the range and diversity of this year’s movies prompted advocacy of a wide range of causes at the Academy Awards. David Willis, BBC News, in Hollywood. The Archbishop of Canterbury, justin Welby, says reports that some cathedrals aren’t paying staff the living wage are ""embarrassing"". The Church of England has been accused of hypocrisy for failing to pay all its staff a minimum of £7.85 an hour and yet calling on other employers to do so. Our religious affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, reports. The Church of England have come under sustained fire ever since its pre-election letter calling for a new moral vision in the nation’s politics. The news that some jobs at Canterbury Cathedral and elsewhere PPV Canterbury Cathedral and elsewhere pay less than the living wage that the church wants all employers to PPV the church wants all employers to pay has laid open to charges of hypocrisy. It is embarrassing. We are getting there as quickly as we can. We have to do it in a way that is responsible to all employees. The Archbishop defended the Bishop’s letter outlining the questions parishioners should ask before they vote. The letter was clear that no institution on earth is perfect. It is not the only area where we fall short of our own standards. We work on it as hard as we can. It said we need a moral basis, a moral compass, at the heart of our life to help us know when we are going wrong. As on the living wage. It falls short of the standards we would like to have. The Church of England says the move towards paying the living wage across all parishes, cathedrals and dioceses, it is a gradual process. Outside York Cathedral today, reactions were mixed. If they want everyone to pay living wage, it is only fair they do. Very difficult. Ultimately, the church is a charity. It depends on people giving money to the church. Politicians said the church must practice what it preaches. Doing politics is different from talking about politics and I think it is really important the Church learns a lesson from this, recovers and gets on the front foot and also by saying that within a first and league certain timescale and everyone employed by the church will be earning a living age will stopjustin Welby made clear that more parts of the church are aiming to pay the living wage by April, 2017. With each cherish a separate entity, that move will be gradual. Hundreds of people with mental health problems have died unnecessarily as a result of poor care according to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. It says basic errors and failures in prisons, police custody and psychiatric hospitals allowed too many people to end their own lives. Our social affairs correspondent, Michael Buchanan, reports. Catherine and Barry Wilson remember the daughter they no longer have. Rebecca spent five years in mental health hospitals before taking her own life when she was 18. An inquest into her death found poor monitoring by her hospital gave her the opportunity to kill herself. Poor planning when transferring her from adolescence to adult psychiatric care also worsened Rebecca’s problems. She went from having everything, that a child, a teenager, would have. The next day she is expected to be an adult and fit in with a lot of older women with a lot of bad health problems, with none of the teenage things around her. Today’s report finds over 650 people with mental health problems killed themselves in prisons or psychiatric hospitals between 2010 and 2013. Researchers say the overwhelming majority of those suicides could be prevented if the same basic errors had not been committed and repeated. Hospitals having places where patients can hang themselves, prisons failing to act on prisoners’ known psychiatric problems. To do the basics things right. Too many of the deaths are caused by the same sorts of mistakes being made over and over. It arises partly because when there is a death, there is not a proper robust investigation, there is not a real level of transparency and openness about what is going on in institutions. The number of suicides in prisons is at a seven-year high. There were four here in Wandsworth alone last year. The report says proper monitoring by staff as well as talking to the families of inmates to find out what might trigger mental health problems could dramatically cut the numbers. Ministers say they are reviewing how high risk prisoners are cared for and also looking at improving how hospital deaths are scrutinised. The inquiry says an independent investigation should follow all suicides in psychiatric units. An inquest has resumed into the deaths of two British servicemen killed in a so-called friendly fire incident whilst serving in Afghanistan. Captain Tom Sawyer and Corporal Danny Winter died six years ago when they were hit by a missile launched by coalition forces during an operation against the Taliban. The World Health Organisation says so-called smart syringes that break after being used once could save a million lives a year around the world. Reusing needles can lead to the spread of diseases like HIV and hepatitis. The WHO wants all countries to be using the new syringes by 2020. Our science editor, David Shukman, reports now from Cambodia. I am in Cambodia in the village of Roka which is in the grip of a health crisis because more than 200 people here have been infected with HIV. They had been given injections by a local unlicensed medic suspected of reusing syringes and needles. The question is, is there any way to prevent this kind of thing from happening again? With me is Marc Koska who has come up with a design for a better kind of syringe. Talk us through the comparison of a normal syringe and your one. This is a normal syringe, billions made around the world. Because of the design, you can use it as many times... It is easy to refill? Exactly. And you can’t sterilise them. There is no way of doing that in a guaranteed way? No. This is an auto-disable syringe which, after use, locks and then breaks. That click is the break? Exactly. It can never be reused again. This idea seems blindingly obvious but you have been pushing for this for 30 years. Where has the resistance come from? There is resistance in many different points, from putting in legislation and policy, to manufacturers changing over to a product which, quite frankly, isn’t that exciting on an economic basis for them. They don’t make a lot of money out of it? Correct. There are a combination of different barriers. It seems we have got the perfect storm and now with all of the components, we will have a chance of putting these out around the world and replacing standard syringes for ever. Right now, here in Roka, there are all of these people, young children, families, infected with HIV. It must be incredibly frustrating for you to see that. It is amazingly traumatic for me to see this first hand. I travel a lot and do see it everywhere I go. But it is also motivating, to make sure that this finally takes place on a global scale. Is it conceivable that the world would switch to single-use syringes OI’ SyI’iI’IgâS yOU CaI’II’Iot USE again? It is totally, totally possible. We have already done this with immunisation which represents less than 10% of the injections given in the developing world. That has been a fantastic success. Now we are targeting the 90% of what we call curative injections, the ones given here in Roka with reused equipment which caused the problem. Marc, many thanks indeed. The World Health Organization today is announcing a new policy - for the world to switch to syringes that can only be used once. They want it to happen by 2020. We will have to see if that is going to be possible. You can see You CaI’I SEE ITIOFE You CaI’I SEE ITIOI’â OI’I You can see more on this special report on tonight’s BBC News at Six PM. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today: Two former foreign secretaries, jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, deny they’ve done anything wrong after being secretly filmed offering their services to a private company for thousands of pounds. In a moment, a full national weather forecast. Plus, the news where you are. But first with news of all of the day’s sport, we’ll cross to the BBC Sports Centre. Good afternoon. Delegates from football’s world governing body, Fifa, are gathering in Doha ahead of crucial meeting in which they’re expected to decide when the controversial Qatar World Cup in 2022 will be played. Our sports news correspondent, Richard Conway, is there now. Richard, there’s big debate over when it will be played. Will there be a clear idea tomorrow? In the last few moments, I have speak and to the sheik of Bahrain, the head of the task force. He has told me that the only option is November and December of 2022. Very clear direction from him he feels thatis clear direction from him he feels that is the only workable option, dismissing Made which the big European clubs have been wanting. -- May. It seems tomorrow we will get a recommendation going forward for ratification next month. The head of the task force telling me today that it would be November and December that would be the ideal time and that the European leagues and clubs will have to get behind that decision for the good of the global game. Thank you very much, Richard. Chelsea say they will appeal the red card given to midfielder Nemanja Matic in their Premier League draw with Burnley on Saturday. Managerjose Mourinho, who’s been critical of officials this season, says video replays would help the game. And his calls will no doubt be backed by managers involved in yesterday’s games, with the referees firmly in the spotlight. Patrick Gearey reports. It is one of the most difficultjobs in sport. Has it become impossible? Kevin was under pressure 15 seconds into yesterday’s match at Southampton, the home side felt the challenge was worthy of a red card and penalty. The referee said no. He turned down a better shot later in the fund with minutes to the break, he ignored handball appeals. the fund with minutes to the break, he ignored handballappeals. He had none of the angles you have just seen. No consolation to Southampton’s manager. Maybe the goalkeeper, it is difficult. The second situation with the penalty, it cannot be more clear for the referee. Unlucky but it is part of football. Should it still be part of a multi-billion pound industry? Next week in football bosses will debate using video technology to help officials. Or Southampton could do was to watch the replays of the opening goal. Raheem Stirling added another for security. They were left to their grumbles. Controversy too at White Hart Lane. Totten felt there was a missed offside in the build up to West Ham’s second goal. Spurs got one back with ten minutes remaining and Harry Kane’s tumble brought a penalty in the fifth minute of stoppage time. West Ham’s manager said he had fallen over. We should do more of that! We have had one penalty this year which tells you how honest we are which means that we are not getting rewarded for it. Sam Allardyce felt the final whistle should have been blown after the penalty. Instead Harry Kane had enough time to finish off the rebound. Unlike him, referees get no second chance. Moeen Ali built the platform for a much-needed win at the World Cup. Tim Hague has more. With an Englishman winning Best Actor at the Oscars, it was about time the England cricket team put in a performance at this World Cup. For the loss against Scotland, they were exiting stage left. Moeen Ali though was not ready to go anywhere. The Spotlight solely on him in Christchurch. He scored 128 runs and reached a century in fitting fashion. A record-breaking opening stand of 172 put England in total control for a change. In was like taking candy from, well, you know. Some pretty child-like shots after and England soon lost four wickets, their Captain arrived at the crease with finally some form-throwing. Morgan looked at his best as the side reached 303 from 50 overs. Could the underdogs be the next side to embarrass England? It looked unlikely with three down for 51+ runs. Coetzer scored 71 and provided entertainment for those that were watching, of course. After that, this became great viewing for Scotland fans, nobody troubling the scores. Not an Oscar winning performance by any means from England, but most importantly, a win. That’s all the sport nor now. Back to you. -- for now. Back to you. Barry George, the man wrongfully convicted of the murder ofjill Dando, has told the BBC a decision not to award him compensation is ""a mockery ofjustice"". Mr George and three other men are protesting against a tightening of the criteria for compensation payouts, in miscarriage ofjustice cases. Rachel Burden has more. Ill-Dando Ill- Dando shot dead Ill-Dando shot dead on her doorstep. It was 1999 at the height of her TV career. It’s so glamorous. Wonderful. Barry George was arrested and jailed for her murder. After eight years behind bars, he was acquitted at a retrial. He has since been refused compensation for his wrongful conviction, losing an appeal against a High Court decision on the grounds that jurors could still reasonably have convicted him despite new evidence that led to his acquittal. When you go into court in any criminal trial, you’re innocent until proven guilty, or so they say. What they are saying effectively is, you’re guilty for your innocence. How can that be? Since then, the Ministry ofjustice has further tightened its rules. Barry and his sister are now campaigning to get the law changed. When you’ve had your whole life ripped to shreds and you come out and you have been so hugely damaged just from being in the environment of a prison, you come out with post-traumatic stress. There’s no assistance for that. Today the pair willjoin protests outside the global law summit which is marking 800 years since the Magna Carta. As forjill Dando’s case, that remains unsolved and the Metropolitan Police are still appealing for information. Time for the weather now. Winter is not over. I’ve got the proof here. A picture taken this morning of a Winter Wonderland at Carbridge in the care gorms National Park, absolutely plastered with snow. And more of that to come here at least through the rest of the day. This weather streaming in across the UK started life in the Canadian Arctic a few days ago. The air goes up, the showers form and then they come down as rain, sleet or snow, blizzard-like through the Scottish mountains through the rest of the day. Some sunshine between the showers for Wales, Midlands, southern England and a bit of wintriness in them, hail or sleet. Only settling on lower levels on the higher ground. Across Northern Ireland and Scotland, a strong wind continuing to blow those showers through. You can see still a lot of snow in those as well. Getting down to lower levels from time to time, but mainly settling that bit higher up. The wind quite a feature through the evening and the early part of tonight. 60mph gusts in Scotland and Northern Ireland. A fairly blustery night elsewhere too. That keeps blowing the showers in across many areas. That means temperatures aren’t going to fall desperately low. Most places staying a few degrees above freezing. Eastern Scotland the prime spot to get some ice by the end of the night. Temperatures that bit lower there. Tomorrow, the winds won’t be as strong. The showers will be a little fewer and further between. Most of us seeing rather more in the way of sunshine. Still cold enough though for a bit of snow across higher ground of northern Britain, Northern Ireland. Temperatures a couple of degrees up on today with lighter winds. It will feel slightly better. Not exactly feeling like spring though. Through the middle of the week, the weather systems are still queueing up. Fewer isobars across the country which means the winds will be lighter on Wednesday for most of us. We’ll get some sunshine across the east particularly on Wednesday and it shouldn’t feel too bad. Double figures across southern and western areas. The weather still looking changeable on Wednesday night. The weather system returning across with heavy rain. Behind that, it’s a cold front so the air gets colder once again. A chill in the wind by the second half of the day and one or two snow showers feeding back into the west of Scotland. Very much up and down with the weather through the week ahead. Keep up-to-date online. Many thanks. Now, a reminder of the top story this lunch time: Two former Foreign Secretaries, jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, have denied they have Don anything wrong after being secretly filmed offering their services to a private company for thousands of pounds. I’ve always sought to act with complete integrity and probity. These are sore did, unfounded allegations. I’m going to fight them all the way. That is it from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Good afternoon, I’m Asad Ahmad. A lawyer who’s helping to lead the fight against Female Genital Mutilation in France, claims the authorities here are too frightened of causing offence which is why there hasn’t been a single conviction for the crime in 30 years. In France, parents have been jailed for allowing FGM. But in London, there’s been nothing. Tara Welsh has been to France to investigate why. At seven years old, something happened to Hodda that would change her for ever. Complications caused by FGM means she’s spent much of her life in hospital. I get a lot of infections. On top of that, I can’t have my own child. Despite the known problems it causes, at least 70,000 women and girls Are estimated to be living with FGM in London. FGM has been illegal in the UK for 30 years, yet there have still been no successful prosecutions. In France, there have been more than 100. I’m going to find out what they’ve done differently and if we can learn anything from them. Like in London, the suburbs of Paris are home to people from all over the world. But the French have been tough on those who think it’s acceptable to practice the ancient custom of cutting. For the two perpetrators, still prison sentences. She says they have reduced the amount of cases because parents are warned their daughters will have their genitals inspected when they go for health check-ups. People fear going to prison. It wouldn’t have been introduced if we didn’t have this combination of information given to the parents and the big stick behind. She says Parisians aren’t afraid of channelling cultural traditions. So you think our authorities have been too soft and scared? Yes. Definitely. The Government says it’s bringing in new legislation. Teachers and doctors must be trained about FGM and will face dismissal if they come across it and don’t report it to the police. But MPs refuse to introduce French style checks. It’s been a hue and cry, if every girl was genitally examined every year. The French minister said, well we can just have a little look. It hasn’t stopped the practice in France. Hodda’s family’s stopped doing it. She hopes others will realise this is child abuse and do the same. And you can see the full report on that story, on Inside Out London, tonight at 7.30 on BBC One. Hours after the US Government warned that shopping centres in Britain, including Westfield in east and west London and Oxford Street could be targeted by terrorists, the Westfield Shopping Centre has said it’ll continue to operate normally. But the company insists it’ll work to make the sites safe for staff, retailers and customers. A video, apparently made by the Somali militant group, Al-Shabba, calls for attacks on Western Complexes. An ex-police officer and Chelsea fan has apologised for his part in an alleged racist incident on the Paris Metro but denies he’s a racist. Richard Barklie, from County Antrim, was wanted by the Metropolitan Police in connection with the incident last week. He says he didn’t make racist chants and he wanted to explain the context of what happened to officers. There’s Oscar success for a family run firm in North London.

And the Crossrail worker who died after almost a ton of concrete collapsed on him in a tunnel. the screening process she underwent on her way home from Africa. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Two of Britain’s most senior parliamentarians, jack Straw and Malcolm Rifkind, have vigorously denied any wrongdoing after they were secretly filmed offering to work for a fake Chinese company. The sting was set up by the Daily Telegraph and Channel lI’s Dispatches programme and in it, both men appear to be accepting cash for access to politicians and diplomats. Both men have been suspended from their parties, though it’s not clear whether they’ve broken parliamentary rules. The prime minister said the allegations against the two men were very serious matters. Let’s go live to our deputy political editor james Landale at Westminster. They have spent more than 30 years in Parliament and helped some of the highest offices in the land, but this evening they are both suspended from their parties, both investigated by House of Commons authorities, their reputations on the line. jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind was secretly filmed last month by undercover reporters pretending to represent a Chinese firm. Both men appeared ready to offer their services to the firm in return for thousands of pounds. Mr Straw was recorded claiming he got laws changed in Brussels by operating under the radar for an existing client, work that could be well rewarded. Within hours of the tape being released, Mr Straw suspended himself from Labour and referred himself to Parliament’s standards Commissioner. That did not stop him being hounded by the media, or denying he had done anything wrong. This interview with a bogus company set up by Channel 1+ was not to do with my work as a member of Parliament, it was to do with whether I would work for them after I had retired. Sir Malcolm, who chairs a committee scrutinising the intelligence agencies, was recorded promising useful access to British diplomats and offering to rights to ministers for information without naming his employer. For thousands of pounds in his spare time. Sir Malcolm also referred himself to the MPs’ standards watchdog, but denied any wrongdoing and defended the right of MPs to have second jobs. These are sordid, unfounded allegations. I am going to fight them all the way, and I will allow the public to make their own judgement once that has been done. So what are the rules? Well, MPs can’t do any kind of lobbying in Parliament for a firm that is paying them. Nor can they try to change government policy by talking to ministers on behalf of that firm. But MPs can work for outside interests, as long as they declare any payments. Both Mr Straw and summer can say they have not breached any of these rules. The rules are one thing, public opinion is another, not least in Sir Malcolm’s west London constituency. If you are going to go into it, do it as a job, a passion. You should not have a second job. Should MPs be able to do a second job? I don’t see why not, yes, as long as they look after their constituents. I would have thought they have enough on their hands seem to their constituents that they would not have time for two jobs. Labour’s leader said that MPs should waive goodbye to outside earnings on this scale. Labour candidate standing at the next election will be banned from taking paid directorships or consultancies. Today, Iam from taking paid directorships or consultancies. Today, I am writing to David Cameron to say he should do the same for his members of Parliament, because we have got to settle this issue of second jobs once and for all. David Cameron said Sir Malcolm Rifkind would be suspended from the Tories and investigated by the party, something that could stop him standing at the election. But the Prime Minister insisted that MPs should be allowed to have outside jobs. What I see from the Labour proposal is actually not outlawing outside business interests, but putting in a new set of rules which would allow someone to work as a trade union official, but would not allow someone to run a family shop or a family publishing business or suchlike. I think that does not make sense. So once again, the House of Commons is in the dock, and once again, no consensus on what needs to be done. That is because we are in the heart of a general election campaign. The parties do not want to be talking about his unresolved issue of what MPs should or should not be allowed to do if they have a second job. That is why the parties have acted with ruthlessness to distance themselves from Malcolm Rifkind and jack Straw today. Neither David Cameron or Ed Miliband want to be talking about this at this time. They know that it just crowds out their election messages and give support to smaller parties, so they will act to close this down as much as they can. The problem with these stories is that they have a habit of lasting for some days. Bethnal Green Academy in east London has said there is no evidence that three of its pupils believed to be heading tojoin IS in Syria were radicalised at the school. The head teacher said access to social media at the Academy was strictly regulated. Police are continuing their investigation into the whereabouts of the girls, who flew from Gatwick to Turkey last Tuesday. Daniel Sandford reports. Shaken and bewildered, the pupils of Bethnal Green Academy in east London, arriving back at school after their half term break, a half term in which three bright teenage girls from the school, due to take their GCSEs this summer, ran away to Turkey. They seemed to be heading for the war and horror of the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. We are all shocked and deeply saddened by the news that three of our students have been reported missing from home. They boarded a flight to Istanbulfrom Gatwick Airport last week. Our thoughts are with the families of the missing girls at this time. Police have advised us that there is no evidence that radicalisation of the missing students took place at the academy. But as pupils headed home this afternoon, there remained a concern that someone in this community or on the internet is grooming young women on behalf of the Islamic State. The three school friends flew out of Gatwick on Tuesday. They have not responded to e-mails, Exmouth edges or phone calls since. One had contacted a Scottish woman already in Syria on Twitter. She is a known recruiter for the Islamic State. The assumption is that they are trying tojoin her. This, in exclusive BBC pictures, is the most likely crossing point into Syria, a town where there is little sign of Turkish government control over the border. A people smuggler explained how foreign women get across the frontier into the so-called Islamic State. As late on Mac or the handover is or was done right on the border, he told us. It is done in the presence of a woman IS member who is with two as fighters. A local bus driver said there were few security checks. I have never seen anyone being stopped, no IDs being checked, he said. But no one the BBC spoke to in the town had seen the three girls, so it is possible that they are still in Turkey. What everyone at the school now wants is news that the girls are safe and returning home to East London, news that after six days still has not come. Daniel Sandford, BBC News, in Bethnal Green. HSBC has described 2014 as ""challenging"" after reporting a 17% drop in its annual profits to £12 billion. Fines and payouts for the misselling of payment protection insurance are partly to blame, as well as higher operating costs. There’s been criticism that nonetheless, the chief executive has still collected a £3.5 million bonus. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed reports. HSBC, the world’s local bank. It is a bank that has always prided itself as a global player. But today, HSBC, which employs nearly 50,000 people in the UK and whose vast profits support all our pension funds, revealed that those profits were down and it had paid billions of pounds in fines. One of the Citibank row’s deadest investment funds told me the results were below expectations. Clearly, what the group has been earning has been negatively impacted by the broader environment. Interest rates are low everywhere, which has been poorfor them. The border economic environment has also impacted on the group. HSBC was seen as having weathered the storm of the financial crisis better than most, but now it is facing a host of problems. Profits have fallen, is facing a host of problems. Profits have fallen by 17%. It has paid fines of £2.lI billion for manipulation of the foreign exchange market and the mis-selling of insurance products. And the bank admitted to feeling shame over allegations that HSBC helps customers invade taxes in its Swiss banking arm. Today, the spotlight fell on Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC. It was revealed that he had bank accounts in Switzerland and a company in Panama into which bonuses were paid. He says that was nothing to do with avoiding tax. Actually, it was all to do with keeping his details private so that his colleagues could not find out how much he was paid. The star Gulliver, who has now shut the Panamanian company, has paid some price for the bank was my feelings. His bonus was cut by half £1 million to £3.lI million. Today, theissue £1 million to £3.lI million. Today, the issue of HSBC’s behaviour again blew up in the House of Commons, when Ed Balls accused the Government of negligence over tax evasion. It is not good enough for this chancellor to shout and bluster and try to sweep these questions under the carpet. The chancellor hit back, and said further action on banks and evasion was imminent. We will take more action in the Budget . All we have all the other side are bunch of arsonists throwing rocks at the firefighters putting out the fire that they started. Today, the bank’s share price fell by 5% as investors worried about overall performance and the ever-increasing cost of regulation. Mr Gulliver insisted that the bank was improving and that a simpler business would be more transparent about how it operated. KemalAhmed, BBC News. Universal benefits for pensioners - such as free TV licences and the winter fuel allowance - will be protected under a future Conservative government. David Cameron told a meeting in Hastings that the benefits were not ""unnecessary luxuries"". Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said they would remove some benefits from better-off pensioners. Political correspondent Eleaner Garnier has the details. Protecting older people, a key pledge David Cameron hopes will keep him in number10. With an election on the horizon, he came to Hastings to repeat his promise and preserve universal benefits the pensioners. Comfort, independence, companionship, health. These are not luxuries, these are what people who have worked and saved all their lives deserve. Why is it fair for young people to have to pay for them? I’ll tell you what I think is fair, it is fair to raise the state pension age which will save half £1 trillion, a significant saving. And at this local seniors club, protecting benefits has gone down well. ~ I have worked hard all my life and I think I have paid my dues. I think we are entitled to it when we are older. I think that some of the things need to be means tested. I don’t believe in means testing of any form. just because someone has worked hard, doesn’t mean they should be penalised. The Conservatives don’t believe in means testing either, saying the savings would be negligible. The amount spent on pension benefits is relatively small. Last year, free TV licences for the over 75s cost £618 million bomb and winter fuel payments costjust over million bomb and winter fuel payments cost just over £2 billion. That is only 2% of the overall benefits bill for pensioners. Along with the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip have all promised to keep free bus passes for pensioners. When it comes to free TV licences for the over 75s, while Labour would keep them, the Lib Dems have said they would take them away from pensioners on the highest rate of tax. But both Labour and the Liberal Democrats want to cut winter fuel payments for the richest pensioners. But all this focused on older people has left these students feeling ignored. They need to do more to focus on the future generations. Being a first-time voter this time, I don’t think younger people want to vote for any of the political parties, because they are not focused on them. Critics claim the Conservatives are deliberately targeting older people because they are more likely to vote. And as the Tories know, more likely to vote for them. Our top story this evening. Two former Foreign Secretaries have been suspended after being caught in a sting appearing to offer access for cash. And still to come. We reveal the shocking conditions still endured by migrants working in Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Later on BBC London: The East London schoolgirls believed to be heading to Syria. We look at the role social media may have played in their radicalisation. And putting a spring in our steps - Carlos Acosta on new efforts to bring dancing to the capital. for the Masters. And one of the world’s rarest breeds of dogs goes back to its borders roots. The World Health Organisation says a new generation of so called smart syringes, which break after being used once, could save a million lives a year around the world. Reusing syringes leads to more than two million people being infected with diseases each year, including HIV and hepatitis. In a major policy announcement the WHO says it wants all countries to be using the new syringes by 2020. Science editor David Shukman reports now from Cambodia where one HIV outbreak has claimed more than 200 victims. The mother is positive? And the boy, positive. I motherand her children caught in a mass infection of HIV. Their story is tragic. To be treated for a variety of ailments they have been given injections by an unlicensed medic. The father saw him using the same syringe more than once. He said he watched him give an injection and then use the syringe again on everyone else. The medic shopin again on everyone else. The medic shop in the centre of the village has closed. He was popular, his injections were cheap, but he is now in custody facing charges of murder. The crisis in the community comes down to something simple, the same syringe being used on one person after another, passing HIV. Because it happens in so many countries, spreading diseases, the World Health Organisation wants a switch to a new kind of syringe, which if you try to reuse it, simply breaks. These are the only ones that can be used. Mark, the inventor of the syringe. He shows it to a team sent in from the capital to tackle the outbreak. If you try to reuse it, it locks and it breaks. They are impressed. What is happening here should never have occurred. I have a design. There are other designs of safety syringes, which you cannot use more than once. They are the same price as a normal needle and syringe. The tragedy in these paddy fields is on an extraordinary scale. In this extended family, 19 are infected with HIV. TRANSLATION: I feel sad because it is a pity for my child. She is innocent, but she is also infected. The WHO wants a global switch to safer syringes by 2020. It is too late for this family. Even the great-grandmother is infected and all of this could have been avoided. The Church of England has been accused of hypocrisy for failing to pay all its staff a ""living wage"", having last week called on Britain’s employers to do just that. A living wage is currently around £7.85 an hour, higherthan the minimum. The Archbishop of Canterburyjustin Welby, says no institution is perfect and steps are being taken to improve conditions. It is embarrassing. We would prefer to be there. We are getting there as quickly as we can. We have to do it in a way that is responsible to all employees. No institution on Earth is perfect. It is not the only area where we fall short of our own standards. We work on it as hard as we can. Religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt is at Lambeth Palace. Caroline, not the best of days for the Archbishop. ~ Iam sure I am sure the archbishop did not wish to wake up to headlines talking about an unholy row and allegations of hypocrisy over the church recommending to employers they should pay the living wage while not doing so in its parishes. The archbishop tackled it head-on and said it was embarrassing they were doing their best to rectify it and aim to do it by 2017. He said the was that each parish and diocese as an individual charity and it is up to them individually. This goes to the archbishop’s letter when he talked about a moribund culture, but said it was not political. Migrants working in Qatar on building projects associated with the 2022 World Cup are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions and being prevented from leaving. The BBC has filmed undercover with the workers who had been promised reforms after international outrage at the high numbers of deaths and poor conditions. Sports editor Dan Roan reports from Qatar, where football leaders gather tomorrow to try and settle on a final date for the tournament. Doha is rising from the desert. The fast Khalifa Stadium host of the opening match of the 2022 World Cup, one of the biggest construction projects in history and all dependent on migrant labour. Here standards are high, but there is concern that on sites across the city, Qatar has failed to act on worker deaths and its controversial system in which employers effectively own labourers and their ability to leave the country. These are the sprawling labour camps outside Doha. It is not a place where we are welcome but some of our team made it onto three sites where many workers live 15 to a room and have to put up with conditions like these, here in one of the richest nations in the world. Speaking us anonymously, they said there has been no improvement. I cannot leave Doha, this Nepalese man tells us, or buy my ticket back home because I do not have my passport and I need an exit visa. I have been here 14 years and nothing has changed, another SBVS. Many workers get sick and there are barely any safety measures on the construction sites. A year ago, Fifa pushed for reforms but critics say they are still waiting. We have seen no change. The system is still in place, it is a system of slavery in the 21st century. It must change. Here, a few kilometres outside the centre of Doha, is what will be an entire new city being built in order to host the World Cup finals. The 1.4 million migrant workers on fast construction projects like this have received plenty of promises. The big question now is whether or not Qatar has the appetite for real change. World Cup projects like new stadia have adopted higher safety standards and universal rights are under way. Wages will be paid electronically to cut corruption. The Qatari government would not comment but those advising it urged patience. I think there are areas where there is no doubt workers are working in slave-like conditions. It is slow progress and we have to be patient but it is ongoing. There is quite a momentum. Back at the labour camps, a kick-about for those building the World Cup dream. Ahead of the most controversial sports event ever, their struggle for rights continues. Britain’s Eddie Redmayne has scooped the best actor award at the Oscars for his role as Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. The film Birdman secured four Oscars, including best film and julianne Moore won best actress for her role as a lecturer with early-onset Alzheimer’s in the film Still Alice. Arts correspondent Will Gompertz is in Hollywood. Will, a career changing night for Eddie Redmayne? ~ I think so and also this place has changed. It feels like the morning after the night before. Yesterday Hollywood was a different place with wall-to-wall celebrities. Security now, it is normal in LA, as normal as LA gets. For Eddie Redmayne it will be a life changing experience as you see in this package, which has some flash. Eddie Redmayne arrived telling everyone he wanted to win Best actor Oscar and then had to wait until the last part of the show to find out he had. The Oscar goes to Eddie Redmayne. I am fully aware I am a lucky, lucky man. This Oscar... Wow! Please, this is so extraordinary, I want to thank my family and you, my wife, I love you so much. He was a young British character actor before he won but will now have to rise to the challenge of being a Hollywood star. Eddie Redmayne will be offered every giant superhero script so let’s see if he can stand firm and say no to the once he does not want to do. Once they have a hot property they want to turn them into a star. The hardest part of the career will be saying no. Eddie Redmayne developed his acting skills during his time at Eton College, attended by Prince William. He undertakes meticulous research before embarking on any role. I went to a motor neurone disease clinic in London and met many people and their families. And also the hawking a family. It is their story. Stephen Hawking was delighted and made his feelings known by posting this message on Facebook which ended with him saying well done, Eddie, Iam Facebook which ended with him saying well done, Eddie, I am very proud of you. The night was notable for the quality of live performances and some of the serious issues raised in acceptance speeches. Recentlyjohn and I performed Glory on the same place that Doctor Martin Luther King and others marched on. This was a landmark of a divided nation but now it is a symbol for change. Lady Gaga entertained the audience in a 50th anniversary celebration of the Sound Of Music. The busy actor returning here for an encore in the near future. We can take a look at the weather. It has been changeable and the next few days will continue to change. One moment sunny and the next day we will get rain, like today. On top of that strong winds. If anything, they will strengthen through this evening through Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north-west of England. The low pressure that arrived is here to stay into tomorrow and will keep driving the weather and the strong wind and the showers, which have been coming and going today. It will not be dry tonight, there will be plenty of showers, some of them wintry particularly in northern parts of the UK. Temperatures will not dip away to load. This is what it looks like first thing in the morning. Across the South, not too bad. They will be sunshine around the south coast, Southeast and East Anglia. And then the further north and north-west you are, the more frequent the showers will be with sleet and snow across the hills and gusty winds. First thing in the morning, still, across the far north-west, windy, gale force wind here. They will tend to use into the afternoon -- here. They will tend to use into the afternoon -- ease. The showers will be less frequent and we will lose some of those big gusts of wind and as a result it will feel milder. Talking about mild weather, the middle of the week will turn mild. A flow of air from the south west means that across western areas, temperatures up to 11 degrees, and there could be sunshine. A bit of a change. A reminder of the main story. Two former Foreign Secretaries have been suspended after being caught in a sting appearing to offer access for cash. Goodbye. Tonight on BBC London News: Too soft and scared. A leading French lawyer claims that the UK is failing to tackle the crime of FGM. People do not want to be in truce of or lack respect the traditions and so on. And they fear to appear racist. We hear about new laws coming in to help protect children from the brutal practice. Also tonight, The Crossrail worker who died after almost a ton of concrete collapsed on him in a tunnel. Fighting back on council cuts - the parents left feeling abandoned as they care for their grown-up autistic children. We do not want to close it, because it is specialising in autistic services. And building memories - how finding a First World War medal has helped one family discover its past. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. A lawyer - who’s helping to lead the fight against Female Genital Mutilation in France - claims the authorities here haven’t been tough enough, out of fear of causing cultural offence. Thousands of young girls in London are at risk of being taken abroad for the procedure. Despite the practice being illegal in the UK for 30 years, there hasn’t been a single prosecution for FGM on a child. But in France, there have been over 100. Children there are regularly checked for signs of FGM until the age of six. Tarah Welsh has the story. These girls all have a very different upbringing to their mother. But, at just six years old, something happened. It would change her for ever. It leaves the most horrendous, unbelievable, indescribable pain. That any human can go through. In Somalia, she was mutilated, or cut, as it is also known. Some African cultures believe that it protects virginity. This woman, too, was left scarred, and will not be able to have her own children because of complications caused by FGM. ~ I get infections. I get a lot of UTI infections. But, on top of that, I cannot have my own child. And, despite the known problems it causes, at least 70,000 women and girls are believed to be living with FGM in London. One of the local mums was going to take her daughter to Somali for the FGM practice. And that was round the corner, in our borough. It is still happening. FGM has been illegal in the UK for 30 years. But, there have still been no successful prosecutions. In France, there have been more than 100. I’m going to find out what they have done differently, to see if we can learn anything from them. Like in London, the suburbs of Paris are home to people from all over the world. But the French have been tough on those who think it’s acceptable to practice the ancient custom of cutting. Linda is a lawyer, who has been responsible for putting many parents and perpetrators behind bars. For the two perpetrators, it is a prison sentence. She says they have reduced cases, because parents have been warned that there daughters will have their genitals inspected when they go for checkups. TRANSLATION: The first presented as measure is at the age of 0-6, we warn parents that it shouldn’t be done. Which means that they know, because it’s written down in our files that, if they do it, there will be problems. How do families feel about a doctor saying to them, ""I want to do this check?"" Are they offended? In general, it is considered normal because we do it for all children, and it has never been taken the wrong way. People fear going to prison. It would never have been reduced if you did not have this combination of information given to the parents and the big stick behind. And she says the Parisians are not afraid of challenging cultural traditions. So, you think our authorities have been too soft, because they are scared of being thought racist? Yes. Definitely. If a white child has been cut, or is molested, of course they would want a prosecution. And they do not consider that, if a black child is tortured. If her genitals has been cut off? But, the government says it is bringing in new legislation. Teachers and doctors must be trained about FGM, and will face dismissal if they come across it and do not report it to the police. But, MPs refused to introduce French-style checks. I think there would be an outcry if every single girl in this country had their genitals examined every year. The French say, when we go to the doctor, we just have a little look. And it hasn’t stopped the practice in France. This woman says we must do whatever it takes to protect girls. In this family, FGM has ended with her. And many, too, hope that it will be abolished within a generation. And Tarah’s here now. Health checks have had an effect in France but in terms of protecting children in London, it’s not got full support? That is right. As you heard, there have been no general checks. The group of MPs advising the government on FGM has suggested doctors have the power to assess girls periodically if she is identified as high risk. That could mean that her mother has had the procedure done. But some people feel that that unfairly targets certain communities. just because a woman has had it done, does not mean she would do it to her own child. That is why the French say that it should be for all girls, notjust is why the French say that it should be for all girls, not just for individual communities. They say thatitis individual communities. They say that it is the only way to stop it, these health checks. The onus is on the doctor to report it, rather than the victim, and that is how you get convictions. It is very sensitive. April are divided. You can hear more about the debate on Inside Out at 7:30pm. Coming up later in the programme: With the East London schoolgirls believed to be heading to Syria, we look at the role social media may have played in their suspected radicalisation. An inquest has heard how language barriers may have contributed towards the death of a ""hugely experienced"" construction worker.

Coming up later in the programme: With the East London schoolgirls believed to be heading to Syria, we look at the role social media may have played in their suspected radicalisation. An inquest has heard how language barriers may have contributed towards the death of a ""hugely experienced"" construction worker. The All year old from Hackney was crushed to death when nearly a tonne of concrete collapsed on him in a tunnel. The man was working on a Crossrail site in March last year when he was killed. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards was in court. His family were in court and have many questions that they want to be answered about his death. They want to know if more could have been done to prevent it. I spent three hours with his mother and sisters on Friday. During that time they cried almost continuously. I have been sitting behind them all the way what we have heard so far this morning. They are devastated. He was the centre of their family. Rene was from Slovakia. He came to London to work as a concrete sprayer in they Crossrail tunnels. work as a concrete sprayer in they Crossrailtunnels. He Crossrail tunnels. He died underground at Paul Byrne, the first worker did I on the project. The court heard that although he was fluent in Spanish, he had limited English and sometimes struggled to understand his colleagues -- Holborn. The officer said that it appeared he was underneath an exclusion area somewhere in the tunnel where he should not have been. Later he was asked if there were any ropes, chains all notices warning workers not to enter that section of the tunnel. The officer replied, no. Rene was using a concrete sprayer like this one. Since his death, safety ropes have been used. Workers going under on the set concrete. Outside the court, the family attended a small demonstration. Campaigners have concerns about safety on the project. We need a public inquiry into the issue of safety on Crossrail. Crossrail says safety is its number one priority, and it has a good safety record. The case continues and could last eight days. The head teacher of the school attended by the three missing pupils thought to be on their way to Syria says access to social media was strictly regulated and there’s no evidence that the girls were radicalised at Bethnal Green Academy. In a moment we’ll explore what role social media may have had in their suspected radicalisation and what parents and the authorities can do to prevent it. First here’s Alex Bushill on how the path to Syria is attracting young Londoners. They are three friends, able students and London teenagers, now on their way to Syria pulls up they left their school in Bethnal Green for the Middle East. Today, their headteacher said this. From the increasing number of similar news reports around the world, it is clear that this is an international issue, which is increasing in severity. And it is a fact in schools across the country and beyond. -- schools across the country and beyond. -- it is affecting. We are constantly reviewing safeguarding procedures. So, why did they leave? We know that they are not alone. These are some of those who have already left their families. It is thought around 50 British women and girls have made their way tojoin the so-called Islamic State. It is thought that other British women who have already made the journey are encouraging others to join them. We know that one of the three friends, Shamima Begum try to get in touch with her. They are promised excitement and adventure. The irony is that women are rarely meant to fight in extreme circumstances. We know this because last month Isis released a manifesto on the role of women recruits. Women -- released a manifesto on the role of women recruits. Women -- girls from the age of nine can marry Isis fighters. Education is supposed to focus on faith and homemaking is Gilles. This leaves and enigmatic question, why are high achieving students being seduced by the promises of one of the most oppressive regimes imaginable, for women? So let’s put that question to two experts whojoin me now. Sajda Mughal - a survivor of the 7/7 bombings who runs a charity to help parents prevent online radicalisation of their children. And a leading academic in the field, Erin Saltman - from the Institute Let’s try and answer that question. Why are young, educated girls inspired or enticed to go to Syria? We must recognise young women are specifically being targeted by propaganda. Both off-line and online recruitment processes are taking place. It is being tailored to women. Perhaps the first year or two of this conflict it was aimed at men but now we have specific female-targeted propaganda. The rethink teenage girls are connecting with the ideology, or to young male fighters who paint a certain picture of their lives in Syria? Looking at these cases and dealing with individuals on a day to day basis and with their mothers, we are hearing more of individuals being radicalised due to grievances that they have. Look at the case of those three girls right now, where one of them had a grievance with Syria and it was raised in terms of her been upset about it. There is a grievance that these individuals have, but it is manipulated by those, mainly through the Internet. The Internet is a force, an area, where radicalisation is happening. These grievances are manipulated, whether they are in chat rooms or on Facebook or Twitter. We cannot deny the influence of social media. One of the girls was supposedly following as many as 70 extremists online. We see women that have migrated to Islamic State territory and have become the wives of jihadist by this. Many of them are looking to connect with other young women to help bring them over. And this is happening in a range of different languages, British, French, German, you name it. Because all of these 550 plus women from Western Europe alone have made this journey. So it is pulling down the barrier of feeling that you could go to Syria. It makes it more tangible when you can talk to someone who is on the ground there. It makes it a very real event. In many of these cases, the families of the young girls were unaware of their plans to leave the country. This grooming over the Internet is happening without the knowledge of parents. Yes, but it is projects like our web Guardian ‘s programme that works with Muslim mothers to provide them with the skills to get online, expose them to the issue of radicalisation, then knowledge of the grievances that their children might have. Projects like that are vital. If women know that there are children are at risk Crutcher Mark not even suspecting, this is a preventative project. We look at 350 Muslim mothers in 2013. 90% of them lacked the skills to get online. 92% did not know what online radicalisation or radicalisation was. And 4% only knew who Isis was. That was the parents. At what point do schools have a judy of care? How closely should they be monitoring the narrative of young girls? Universities are required to look for signs of radicalisation in essays. Should schools be put under the same pressure? The role of schools is to help in that prevention area, and target the roots of radicalisation. Something critical that some schools are starting is to give critical consumption skills, so that students questioned the type of material that they find online, so that they do not just take they find online, so that they do notjust take it and assume that it is correct, that they have the skills to be critical of that. So that that material does not get to the point where they are looking at signs of radicalisation. The debate must continue another time. Thank you both for coming in. Still to come: Building memories - how finding a First World War medal has helped one family discover its past. Families in Haringey say they feel ""desperate and abandoned"" over council proposals to cut £25 million from services for adults with autism and learning disabilities. The local authority, which says it’s been forced to make tough choices because of government spending cuts, will vote tonight on whether to approve the plans. Sonja jessup is in Haringey for us now. You join me from a very noisy and lively protest outside the Haringey council offices where the boat is being taken the night. There is anger and fear over these proposals which include closing three daycare centres. We went to speak to some of the families using these centres. We were not allowed to film inside, but we wanted to hear about the impact that they say it would have on them. Grace says the local daycare centre is a lifeline, notjust Grace says the local daycare centre is a lifeline, not just for her daughter, but for herself. She is terrified it could close. The first time that I heard it I was so disturbed, I could not sleep. I am not getting younger, myself. And for me to handle her on my own is impossible. Three centres could be shut under plans to cut into £5 million from adult social care in Haringey. There are plans to provide more care in the community, but family say theirjob and have complex needs and they will not be able to cope. You cannotjust expect people with very complex conditions can just integrate the way that you do, or I do, andjust can just integrate the way that you do, or I do, and just dissipate as an ordinary resident. They are not ordinary, they are extraordinary people who need extraordinary levels of support. This woman agrees. She will soon turn 79 and wonders what will happen to her daughter. I’m sure that her nose is broken from... The leader of Haringey council admits that the cuts are severe. And that the authority has been forced to make huge savings by central government. I understand the people feel comfortable and familiar in certain centres, but the message is that you can still receive the same service in future, I’ll be at thatit same service in future, I’ll be at that it might change. Campaigners say that Haringey is making drastic changes without proper consultation. When these services go and the buildings go, they are gone for ever, and so are the staff, who have a huge amount of expertise. This evening, campaigners gathered to march on the Civic Centre in Haringey. They say that they simply cannot afford to give up their fight against the cuts. We asked the Department for communities and local and four at comet on these cuts. They have not got back to us. -- communities and local government. For a comment. But they said that these families rely on staff who understand their public ‘s needs. They will be waiting outside to hear what the council decides. Less than a week after Chelsea football fans were accused of racially abusing a black man at a Paris tube station, today supporters of West Ham are at the centre of video footage involving a racist song. Thought to have been recorded on public transport in the build-up to their match with Tottenham yesterday, the song insults the jewish community. West Ham issued a statement saying they could impose banning orders if fans are found guilty. The family of a man from Tring who fought in the First World War are delighted to be reunited with his medal, that they thought was lost for ever. George Butcherjr says the discovery led him to find our more about his father’s experience in the trenches - something he rarely spoke about. And, as Sarah Harris reports, in the end, his Military Star was found not too far from home. Backin Back in the hands of the Butcher family in during, Hertfordshire, it was George’s father, also George, who was awarded the military staff after serving on the Western front. It means so much that the suffering he went through was rewarded. Terrible conditions, in trenches. Up to their waste in water and mud. And then having to be responsible for their horses. And making sure that they had pretty well bedded down for the night, or if they were ill, or had to be fed and watered. It was looking after horses that George senior talked about most from his time in the Army service Corps from 1915-18. He kept animals for the rest of his life. His family say that they can feel his spirit when they hold the medal. It is absolutely thrilling. just feeling it, that wonderful feeling absolutely thrilling. just feeling it, that wonderfulfeeling of history that is in your hand. It was almost 100 years old, and I was so excited. We can see that he got the 1914-15 Star. The medal, family recollections about George are being added to the World War I database at the Imperial War Museum in south London. The main aim of the project is to make sure that all of these things are brought together, so that they are permanent memorials to people that served, that were involved in the First World War, but also, it is a great research resource for the future. The medal has been loaned to the Bucks County Museum, but the Butcher family say that they will take better care of it this time, so that it can be passed down to future generations. Now, we all know how Strictly Come Dancing got the nation’s feet tapping and into our ballrooms and dance studios. But now the globally renowned ballet dancer Carlos Acosta is hoping to persuade politicians and those members of public STILL not convinced, about the importance of dance. Sojust how convincing is he? Our Arts Correspondent Brenda Emmanus has been finding out. He is one of the most famous ballet dancers in the world. And today, Carlos Acosta took to a platform to express itself in words, not dance. He was part of a panel debate on the power of the arts to create change and to discuss its current challenges. As someone with such a formidable reputation in the industry, what are your concerns? We would like to see more access. Right now, it costs a lot to have a ballet class are dance class. And I think thatit class are dance class. And I think that it shouldn’t happen because that created division in those who can afford it and those who cannot. And there was much talent that we are missing. The debate is one of several discussions on the arts that form part of the BBC initiative called Get Creative. Dance is something that has given me so much confidence and freedom, and also, rigour and discipline in howl confidence and freedom, and also, rigour and discipline in how I think about everything. Dance has a lot of elements that apply to real life. The new manifesto for dance was launched at the House of Commons by Dance UK, calling on politicians to recognise the significant benefits of the artform. At 83, Pam is still there and performing as part of the company of elders. When you have been working and you retire, you find yourself becoming invisible. But when we went to Sadler ‘s Wells, and we started dancing, you are different, you are dance, you are real person. Whilst these elders find confidence in movement, those involved in teaching and training believe that early initiation brings rich rewards. The most crucial thing is that all young people have the opportunity to experience dance in its richest form, at the youngest age. Unless they experience it at a young age, notjust watching it but doing it, then they will not begin to reap the benefits that could last a lifetime. One great leader could be testament to how movement can create movements. Time for a check on the weather with Wendy Hurrell. Breezy, like it was today. But often quite sunny. It is certainly going to be that breeze that we will notice. We have had quite gusty conditions today. These are the peak gusts that we recorded. It was from a west-south-westerly direction, but with very dry air, so it felt quite chilly. It felt more like 0 Celsius, actually. It is because of that deep area of low pressure across Scotland. It has been pushing cloud towards us. These were the showers that we had today. Some people have seen a little bit of snow, but it has mostly been falling as rain. In any case, they have fizzled out a little bit. For the next two hours, there will be some dry weather and clear skies. There is every chance that we will see showers over the West being blown as far as the London area overnight. Again, these might be wintry, but mostly they are falling as rain. We should avoid frost, because the breeze will continue to blow. First thing tomorrow, breezy again. Not quite as cold and the breeze tomorrow. Showers will be few and far between. And the sun will be shining. Around nine Celsius, feeling less cold than it was today. Clear overnight into Wednesday, but cloud will arrive later, bringing with it some showers for the first part of Wednesday. It looks like the afternoon will bring more in the way of sunshine. It is worth noting that it is going to be less breezy on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, after a dry start morning rush hour, it will rein in the afternoon. Some heavy bursts of rain. And another breezy but right and to delete. And they chilly start that we can. -- breezy but bright end to the week. Now the main headlines. Former Cabinet Ministers, jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, have vigorously denied any wrong doing, after they were secretly filmed offering to work for a fake Chinese company. Both men have been suspended from their parties. That’s it. Thanks forjoining us. More on the day’s stories on our website. And I’ll be back with our late news.

Labour’sjack Straw, filmed by undercover reporters, appears to offer access to a private company in return for money. Another former Foreign Secretary, Conservative Sir Malcom Rifkind, faces similar accusations, but both men deny breaking any rules. These are sordid and unfounded allegations.

Later on BBC London: Claims women are still being subjected to FGM because the British Authorities are too scared to act. And an inquest hears how a Crossrail worker was crushed to death by almost a ton of wet concrete. Good evening. Two former Foreign Secretaries, Labour’sjack Straw and the Conservative Sir Malcolm Rifkind, have been suspended from their Parliamentary parties. They were both secretly filmed by undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph and Channel Four, apparently offering their services to a private company for money. Both men have denied breaking any rules. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, has more details. They have spent more than 30 years in Parliament, held some of the highest offices in the land. Tonight, both are suspended from their parties, both under investigation by the Commons authorities. jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind were secretly filmed by undercover reporters, pretending to represent a Chinese firm. Both appeared ready to officer viss to the firm, in return for thousands of pounds. Sir Malcolm, who chairs a committee was recorded promising useful access to British diplomats and offering to write to ministers for without, without naming his employer. All he said in his spare time. How much might he want. £5,000-£8,000. He referred himself to Parliament standards commissioner, but the Conservatives suspended him and began an internal party investigation, something which could stop him standing as an MP at the election. He told me he had done nothing wrong. These are sordid and unfounded allegations. I am going to fight them all the way. I will allow the public to make their own judgment once that has been done. jack Straw in turn was recorded claiming he had got laws changed in Brussels by operating under the radar for an existing client. Work that could be well rewarded. Mr Straw suspended himself from Labour and referred himself to Parliament standards watchdog. It did not stop him being hounded by the media or denying he had done anything wrong. This interview with as it turned out a bogus company set UP as it turned out a bogus company set up by Channel 1+ was not to do with mY up by Channel 1+ was not to do with my work as a Member of Parliament. It was to do whether I would work for them after I had retired. What are the rules? Well MPs cannot do any lobbying in Parliament for a firm that is paying them. Nor can they can try and change Government policy. But MPs can work for outside interests, as long as they declare any payments, both Mr Straw and Sir Malcolm say they have not breached any rules. The rules are one thing and public opinion is another. Not least in Sir Malcolm’s West London constituency. If you go into it, do it as a job, do it as a passion and thatis it as a job, do it as a passion and that is what you do. You should not have a second job. Should MPs be aible to do a second job? I don’t see why not. So long as they look after their constituents. I would have thought they had enough on their hands seeing to their constituents. They would not have time for two jobs. constituents. They would not have time for twojobs. About one-third of MPs have a kind of second job. Labour said that was too many. Labour candidates standing a at the next election will be banned from taking paid directorships or consultancies. Today I am writing to David Cameron saying he should do the same for his Members of Parliament. We have to settle this issue once and for all. Cameron said existing rules should be properly enforced. He insisted MPs should be allowed to have outside jobs. What I see from the Labour proposal is actually not out lawing outside business or interests, but putting a new set of rules, which would for instance, allow someone to work as a trade union official, but would not allow someone to run a family shop or a family publishing business or such like. That does not make sense. The House of Commons in the dock and once again, no consensus on what needs to be done. Both Labour and the Tories have acted fast to try and distance themselves from these two MPs. They want to contain any potential damage which may be caused. They do not want voters to feel more hostile to main-stream politicians, because that boosts support for smaller parties. This is not over. The Telegraph is publishing fresh allegations about jack Straw tonight. Sir Malcolm Rifkind is facing his party later this week. In the mean time, the issue of MPs’ second jobs remains unresolved. While it does so, this is not the last time that MPs will be caught talking candidly to undercover reporters. Thank you. HSBC has described 2014 as a ‘challenging year’ after reporting a 17% drop in its annual profits to £12 billion. Britain’s biggest bank is now facing allegations that its private Swiss bank helped customers to avoid taxes. HSBC’s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said the claims had brought shame on the organisation, as our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, reports. HSBC, the world’s local bank. It is a bank which has always prided itself as a global player. But today, HSBC, which employs nearly 50,000 people in the UK, and whose vast profits support all our pension funds, revealed that those profits were down and it had paid billions of pounds in fines. I was told the results were below expectations. Clearly the income which the group has been earning has been negatively affected by the broad environment, you know, interest rates are low everywhere - that is very poor for them. Also, the broader economic environment, especially with problems in Europe, has always impacted the group. HSBC was seen as having weathered the storm of the financial crisis better than most, but now it is facing a host of problems. Profits have fallen by 17%. It has paid fines of £2.lI billion for manipulation of the foreign exchange market and the mis-selling of insurance products. The bank admitted to feeling shame over allegations that HSBC helped customers avoid paying taxes in its Swiss banking arm. Today, the spotlight fell on Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC. It was revealed that he had bank accounts in Switzerland and a company in Panama into which bonuses were paid. Now, he said that was nothing to do with avoiding tax, actually it was all to do with keeping his details private, so that his colleagues couldn’t find out how much he was paid. Mr Gulliver, who has now shut the Panamanian company, said he paid full UK tax on all his global earnings. He has paid some price for the banking’s failings, his bonus was cut by £500,000 to £3.lI million. Today, the issue of HSBC’s behaviour again blew up in the House of Commons when Ed Balls accused the Government of negligence over tax evasion. It is not good enough for this Chancellor to shout and bluster and try to sweep these questions under the carpet. The Chancellor hit back and said further action on banks and evasion was imminent. We will take more action in the Budget and all we have on the other side are a bunch of arsonists throwing rocks at the firefighters putting out the fire that they started. Today, the bank share price fell by 5% as investors worried about overall performance and the ever-increasing cost of regulation. Mr Gulliver insisted the bank was improving and a simpler business would be more transparent about how it operated. There is no evidence that three girls, thought to be heading to Syria tojoin Islamic State, were radicalised at school - according to the principal of Bethnal Green Academy in east London. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, flew from London to Turkey last Tuesday. Our home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, has the latest. Shaken and bewildered, the pupils of Bethnal Green Academy in east London, arriving back at school after their half-term break, a half-term in which three bright teenage girls from the school, due to take their GCSEs this summer, ran away to Turkey. They seemed to be heading for the war and horror of the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. We are all shocked and deeply saddened by the news that three of our students have been reported missing from home. Our thoughts are with the families of the missing girls at this time. Police have advised us that there is no evidence that radicalisation of the missing students took place at the academy. But as pupils headed home this afternoon, there remained a concern that someone in this community, or on the internet, is grooming young WOITIEFI on behalf of the Islamic State. The three school friends flew out of Gatwick on Tuesday. They have not responded to e-mails, text messages or phone calls since. One had contacted a Scottish woman already in Syria on Twitter. She is a known recruiter for the Islamic State. The assumption is that they are trying tojoin her. This, in exclusive BBC pictures, is the most likely crossing point into Syria, a town where there is little sign of Turkish government control over the border. A people smuggler explained how foreign women get across the frontier into the so-called Islamic State. ""The handover is always done right on the border"", he told us. ""It is done in the presence of a female IS member who is with two IS fighters"". A local bus driver said there were few security checks. TRANSLATION: I have never seen anyone being stopped, no IDs being checked. But no-one the BBC spoke to in the town had seen the three British girls. What everyone at the school now wants is news that the girls are safe and returning home to East London, news that after six days still has not come. Daniel Sandford, BBC News, in Bethnal Green. Migrants working in Qatar, on building projects linked to the 2022 World Cup, are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions, according to evidence seen by the BBC. A team has filmed under cover with the workers, who’ve been given repeated promises that things will improve following worldwide outrage at the high number of deaths among the workforce. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, reports from Qatar, where football leaders gather tomorrow to settle a final date for the tournament. Doha is rising from the desert, the vast stadium, a flagship venue for the 2022 World Cup. One of the biggest construction projects ever, and all dependent on migrant labour. There’s wide concern that on sites across the city Qatar’s failed to act on worker deaths and its controversial system, where employers effectively own labourerers and their ability to leave the country. These are the sprawling labour camps on the outskirts of Doha. journalists aren’t allowed in here, but some of our team made it onto three sites, where workers live up to 15 to a room and endure conditions like this, here in one of the richest nations in the world. Speaking to us anonymously, they said there’s been no improvement. 110 improvement. TRANSLATIONZ no improvement. TRANSLATIONZ I no improvement. TRANSLATION: I cannot leave Doha or buy my ticket back home because I don’t have my passport and I need an exit visa. TRANSLATION: I have been working in Doha for the past 14 years and nothing has changed. Many get sick by working in the summer heat. There are barely any safety measures at construction sites. A year ago, Fifa pushed for reforms, but the critics say they’re still waiting. We’ve seen no change. The system is still in place. It’s a system of slavery in the 21st century and it must change. Here, a few kilometres outside the centre of Doha is what will be an entire new city being built in order to host the World Cup Finals. The 1. 4 million migrant workers on vast construction projects like this one have received plenty of promises. The big question now is whether or not Qatar has the appetite for real change. Qatar 2022 say World Cup projects like new stadia have adopted higher safety standards and universal rights are on the way. Wages will be paid electronically to cut corruption. The government here wouldn’t comment, but those advising it urge patience. I think there are some areas where there is no doubt that workers are working in slave-like conditions. Yes, it is slow progress. We have to be patient. But it is ongoing and there’s quite a momentum. Back at the camps, a kick about for those building Qatar’s World Cup dream ah, head of the most controversial sports event ever, their struggle for rights continues. David Cameron has confirmed that all pensioners will continue to receive benefits - such as winter fuel payments and free bus passes - if the Conservatives win the general election. He said they were not ""unnecessary luxuries"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said they would remove some benefits from pensioners who are better off. Our political correspondent, Eleanor Garnier, reports from Hastings. Protecting older people, a key pledge David Cameron hopes will keep him in NumberTen, with an pledge David Cameron hopes will keep him in Number Ten, with an election on the horizon, he came to Hastings to repeat his promise and preserve universal benefits for pensioners. Comfort, independence, companionship, health, these aren’t luxuries, they are what people who’ve worked and saved all their lives deserve. So why is it fair for young people to have to pay for them? I tell you what I think is fair is it’s fair to have raised the state pension age, which has saved or will save us over half a trillion pounds, a significant savings. At this local seniors club, protecting benefits has gone down well. I’ve worked hard all my life I think I’ve paid my dues. I think we’re entitled to it when we’re olding. Some of the things need to be means tested. I don’t believe in means testing of any form. just because someone has worked hard they shouldn’t be penalised. The Conservatives don’t believe in means testing either, saying the savings would be negligible. The amount spent on pensioner benefits is relatively small. Last year, free TV licenses for the over 75s cost £618 million and winter fuel payments cost just over £2 billion, that’s only 2% of the overall benefits bill for pensioners. Along with the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip have all promised to keep free bus passes for pensioners. When it comes to free TV licenses for the over 75s, while Labour would keep them, the Lib Dems have said they would take them away from pensioners on the highest rate of tax. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats want to cut winter fuel payments for the richest pensioners. But all this focus on older people has left these students feeling ignored. They need to be doing more to focus on the future generations. Being a first-time voter this time, I don’t think that younger people want to vote for any of the political parties because they’re not focussed on them. Critics claim the Conservatives are crib rattly targeting -- the Conservatives are crib rattly targeting -- deliberately targeting older people because they’re more likely to vote, and as the -- older people because they’re more likely to vote, and as the -- the Tories know more likely to vote for them. The World Health Organisation says a new generation of so-called smart syringes - that can only be used once - could save a million lives a year worldwide. More than 16 billion injections are administered annually. But re-using syringes leads to more than two million people being infected with HIV and hepatitis, and other conditions, every year. The World Health Organisation believes that ""smart syringes"" - ones that break after a single use - could be widely available by 2020. Our science editor, David Shukman, reports now from Cambodia, where more than 200 people have been infected with HIV injust one village. Zblt mother’s positive. And the boy, positive. And this girl, positive. A mother and her four children caught in a mass infection of HIV and their story is tragic. To be treated for a variety of ailments, they’ve been given injections by an unlicensed medic. The father saw him using the same syringe more than once. He says he watched the medic give an injection and then use the syringe again on everyone else. The medic shopin again on everyone else. The medic shop in the centre of the village is now closed. He was a popular figure. His injections were cheap, but he is now in custody, facing charges of murder. The crisis engulfing this community comes down to something remarkably simple, the same syringe being used on one person after another, passing HIV between them. And because this happens in so many countries, spreading different diseases, the World Health Organisation now wants a complete switch to a new kind of syringe, which if you try to reuse simply breaks. These are the only ones that can be used... The investor of what’s called an autodisable syringe. He shows it to a team of medics, sent in from the capital to tackle the outbreak. You inject and if you try to reuse it, it breaks. They’re impressed. Now you can’t use it again. What’s happening here should never have occurred. I’ve got a design and there are other designs of safety syringes that you simply cannot use more than once. They’re the same price as a normal needle and syringe. The tragedy in these Paddy fields has already claimed four lives. In this one extended family, 19 are infected with HIV. TRANSLATION: Ifeel sad, very, very sad because it’s a pity for my child. She is innocent, but she’s also infected. The World Health Organisation wants a global switch to safer syringes by 2020. It’s too late for this family. Even the great grandmother is infected and all of this could have been avoided. The Archbishop of Canterbury has admitted it’s embarrassing that some churches, including in his own diocese, are not paying the living wage. The Church of England has been accused of hypocrisy for failing to PPV accused of hypocrisy for failing to pay at least 7. £7.85 an hour while calling on others to do just that. The Archbishop acknowledged it wasn’t the only area where the church fell short of its standards. The church under hostile fire, as Conservative politicians launched a barrage of criticism. It emerged today that despite calling on employers to pay the living wage, rather more than the minimum wage, the church itself was not always practising what it preached. Some churchjob ads show practising what it preached. Some church job ads show pay levels below the living wage. For example at Pickering church and Lichfield cathedral and even Canterbury Cathedral itself. It’s embarrassing. We would prefer to be there. We’re getting there as quickly as we can. We have to do it in a way that is responsible to all employees. The bishop’s and Archbishops have come under attack for everything from living in palaces to the level of their own wages, since writing this pastoral letter in. It they say that they’ve seen the burningoning of in-work poverty, people who, despite working hard, can’t earn enough to live decently, which is why the Church of England says it’s backing the concept of the living wage. Conservative MP Nadene Dorries, terms it hypocrisy. It’s out of touch with people and their lives and they prove that by criticising the Government saying that people on a minimum wage cannot live with dignity and at the same time paying their own employees minimum wage. The Church of England cannot have its cake and eat it. How do those employees feel? As a student, Marcus worked at Canterbury Cathedral as a tour guide earning the minimum wage. My personal experience of working at the cathedral is about the. What I think is more important than the salary is the opportunity to contribute to the cathedral itself. Every day that you worked there, you feel that you’re part of something bigger. It has a history, which is very important. The Archbishop says more parishes, diocese and cathedrals are aiming to pay their staff the living wage by 2017 and that no institution on earth is perfect. Last night’s Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles was noted for the strong political messages from some of the winners, including the actress Patricia Arquette, whose demand for wage equality for women was loudly applauded. The British actor, Eddie Redmayne, won Best Actor for his portrayal of the scientist Professor Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. Our arts editor, Will Gompertz, is live in Los Angeles. ~ I have to say, Hollywood this afternoon is completely different to Hollywood yesterday afternoon. The security forces have gone.

Life is unlikely to be that for Eddie Redmayne after last night’s win, this package has flash photography. Eddie Redmayne arrived telling everybody he hoped to win an Oscar and then went inside and found out he had. The Oscar goes to Eddie Redmayne. I am fully aware that I am a lucky, lucky man. Erm...... This Oscar- wow! Is going to change things. Now Eddie Redmayne will be offered every giant superhero script. Let’s see if he can stand firm and say no to the ones he doesn’t want to do. Here’s where the hardest part of his career is. He has to say no to a lot of things. The Oscar did not come easy. It was a role that required meticulous research and physical transformation. Making this film I spent four months going to motor neurone disease clinic in London. I met many people, their families and not only them, but the Hawking family. Stephen Hawking was delighted with the win and made his feelings known by posting this on Facebook, which ended with his saying, ""Well done, Eddie, I’m very proud of you."" The night was notable for the quality of the live performances and some of the serious issues raised in the acceptance speeches. Recentlyjohn and I got to go to Selma and perform Glory on the same bridge that Dr King and the people of the Civil Rights Movement marched on, 50 years ago. This bridge was once a landmark of a divided nation, but now it’s the symbol for change. Patricia Arquette, who symbol for change. Patricia Arquette, who won Best Supporting Actress for her role as a struggling single mother in Boyhood, also had something to sayment It’s our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the United States of America.

In New York, we heard testimony from those who were injured, reliving the horrors of the attacks.

Cigar enthusiasts from around 80 countries have gathered in the Cuban capital, Havana, for the country’s annual cigar festival. It comes amid new rules granting US visitors to Cuba permission to buy up to $100 worth of cigars, previously banned under Washington’s economic embargo on the communist island. The directors of some of the main cigar brands in Cuba are hopeful that improved ties will bring renewed investment and support for the country’s cigar industry. From Havana, Will Grant reports. Every year, the festival is the highlight of the true cigar aficionado. Industry insiders around the world gather in Cuba to sample some of the country’s most iconic exporter. Whether the visitors are here just to make contacts, to order tobacco products and humidors or St Peters so cut the atmosphere, this is one of the Communist’s Island’s premier trade events. This year, there is a key difference. Americans, previously banned from bringing them back into the US under the trade embargo are now at allowed to bring $100 of cigar products back in their luggage. Is the first time that we have been able to legally purchase. Some of us who have been here before had purchased underground. This is the first time that we can do it and we are very happy- that we can do it and we are very happy. The company behind the brand is a joint-venture with the government. They hope that the US economic embargo will be lifted as part of the current forum between nations, something that they say would be a major boost for the tobacco industry in the country. TRANSLATION: ourfuture market share to reach in the US is 70%. It is clear that we will reach this in the long-term.

Rats haven’t always received the best press but their image may be about to get a bit of a boost. It turns out they may not have been responsible for the Black Death after all. Black rats have always been blamed for spreading the bubonic plague, but now scientists say gerbils from Asia may in fact have been responsible. They found outbreaks in Europe were strongly linked to periods of warm and wet weather in Central Asia. Those are conditions in which the population of gerbils, and the fleas living on them, boomed. The rodents then passed the disease onto domestic animals and traders travelling along the Silk Road. In the United States, a single mother of four children has won $188 million in the lottery.

Showers continue to feed in all the way through to first light. While some of the showers will be as sleet and snow with the occasional rumble of thunder as well, temperatures will be low enough for some ice to form in the central and eastern areas. While we continue that showery and blustery theme through today, there will be some sunshine through the showers. The low pressure zone driving it all is starting to ease away. There’s a risk of flooding in the Bay of Biscay. Leaving that low pressure zone behind, just one or two showers. Wintry showers over the high ground but mostly as rain. The best of the driest and brightest weather will be along the south coast and in these eastern areas but pavements could still be slippery first thing. More showers in the north, and while these won’t be as wintry as what we saw on Monday morning, there will still be quite a few around. And the wind will add to the chill to start the day. Blustery winds and showers for many in the north-west, but not as many showers reaching the south-east. Some places will stay dry all day long. Showers will turn back into sleet and snow later for parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north-west of England. These are the temperatures for the afternoon. Again, the wind will make it feel colder. Tuesday night into Wednesday, the wind begins to ease. More cloud comes in from the Atlantic. Outbreaks of rain and not as cold to start the day on Wednesday. There will be frost in some places, but some places will start the day in double figures. The best of any brightness in the east. Temperatures will only slowly increase. In the west, underneath the cloud, temperatures in double figures. The most persistent showers over the hills. Wednesday night into Thursday, this area of low pressure in the north continues to drag in mild air. A much milder night for all of us to take things into Thursday. Showers clear from the south-east corner around lunchtime and early afternoon. Brighter skies behind and temperatures falling through the day, leaving sunshine but still feeling cold. Goodbye.

Now on BBC News all the latest business news live from Singapore The ripple effect of the big drop in the price of oil. We investigate the impact on the wider industry. And meet the people who say add an makes needs to do much more if they are going to benefit. -- Abenomics. Welcome to Asia Business Report. The price of oil has dipped again. This could be considered after a rally. In a special look at the drop, we are looking at the dramatic decline in $150 injune 2014 to are looking at the dramatic decline in $150 in june 2014 to less than $50 earlier this year. This has ramifications beyond the buyers and sellers of fuel. With development being cut back, what is happening to the rig is crucial for offshore drilling? Singapore is one of the world’s busiest ports. It is packed with tugboats and supply vessels. A 24-hour operation servicing the shipping industry. In among it all, an oil rig. This is a drilling rig. It drills the wells and once they are complete, it moves on to the nextjob. The number of rigs actively drilling in any one point in time is considered a good gauge of the health of the industry. This one is here because it recently lost its contract. Nobody wants it. With lower oil prices, demand for drilling services has dropped dramatically. So many of the rigs in Singapore and up. Effectively putting two storage of anchorages across the region. In Southeast Asia alone, there are around 182 rigs. Less than half of them are currently in service. David Griffin’s company repairs and maintains rigs. If you look at the rig utilisation rate, which looks at the number of rigs in the industry and are available, there is an increasing number of rigs becoming idle. For the drilling industry as a whole, we are seeing less income, less revenue for drilling companies and all subsequent service companies. If you kilometres away, this man runs another business servicing the oil industry. He points out that while rig demand is down, new rigs ordered before the plunge are still rolling off the production line. When was the last time you saw it like this? When there was a drop in prices. Similar situation. The rigs are all stacked. There is no work. We are seeing a lot of rigs in Singapore. It is a big manufacturing base. Are they going to get work? suspending budgets for this year and next year. investment. There is a lot of money waiting for better times. What impact is the slump in oil prices having on refiners? I asked the question ofjohn Driscoll. A lot of refineries will have priced in oil. The costs are dropping.

Migrant workers employed on World Cup projects in Qatar have told the BBC they’re still living in squalid conditions, despite promised improvements. The Archbishop of Canterbury has admitted that some churches are not paying staff the living wage. The Church of England has been accused of hypocrisy. A church under hostile fire as conservative politicians launched a barrage of criticism. It emerged today that despite calling on employers to pay the living wage, the church itself is not always Some church job ads shall pay levels below them living wage for example at Pickering Church. And at Lichfield Cathedral, and even Canterbury Cathedral itself. It’s embarrassing. We would prefer to be there and we are getting there as quicky as we can. We have to do so in a way responsible to all employees. Bishops and archbishops have come under attack from everything to living in palaces to the level of their own wages. In this pastoral letter, they say they see the burgeoning of in-work poverty, that people work hard but can’t earn enough to live decently. That is why they say they are backing the concept of the living wage. This Conservative MP terms that hypocrisy by the church. It is as out of touch with ordinary people as any other organisation is and they prove that by criticising the Government, saying people on a minimum wage cannot live with dignity while at the same time paying their own employees the minimum wage. The Church of England cannot have its cake and eat it. But how do those employees feel? At a student, this man worked as a tour guide at Canterbury My personal experience was brilliant and more important than the salary paid was the opportunity to contribute to the cathedral itself. Everyday working there, you feel part of something bigger, history, and that’s important. The archbishops say more cathedrals, and parishes, are aiming to pay the living wage by 2017 in that no institution on earth is perfect.

Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. Hello. This is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up on this programme: just hours from now, a decision will be made on when the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be played. Manchester City welcome Barcelona as they play the first leg of their last 16 Champions League tie on Tuesday. And after a season long suspension, the New York Yankees baseballer Alex Rodriguez returns to preseason training three days early. Hello and welcome to the programme wherever you may be. A decision is expected on Tuesday as to what part of the year in 2022 The Qatar World Cup will be staged. Fears over the excessive heat have meant that staging it during their summer are almost impossible. But as our sports news correspondent Richard Conway reports, the alternative dates being suggested won’t be met with universal acceptance. Qatar winning the right to host the 2022 World Cup has proven to be one of the most controversial decisions history of professional sport and yet, this week here in the capital, they may get a resolution. That is what FIFA and the local organisers will be hoping for. Bahrain has sent a task force for the last 1.5 years, looking into when this tournament decreed that it will still be too hot in the moved. A range of other people in the game at him. The question is when. Moving into the winter causes disruption to the domestic league. European voices have said that if it can’t be held when it was originally supposed to be held, it can’t be held here at all. What we get from the task force is an announcement thatit the task force is an announcement that it will be moved to November and December. That is what I have been told. I have been told that it is the only option. january/February to not work because of the clash with the wind it in a fix. May it does not work because it is too close tojune. Well, according to Hassan Al Thwadi, the head of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, they are ready to comply with whatever decision is taken on Tuesday. We have always adhered to the football community’s decision. The task force that is meeting tomorrow and will be making a recommendation for the executive committee to make a decision as members of many different representative football communities. In the end, whatever decision comes, we are ready to host it at any point in time. In the end, the football community decides. The task force represents many people in the community and whatever decision gets made, we are ready to comply. The UEFA Champions League last 16 continues on Tuesday with two more first-leg ties. juventus host Borussia Dortmund in Turin, while Barcelona travel to Manchester City in perhaps the most intriguing of the matches as the hosts have a score or two to settle. Ben Croucher reports. Deja vu. The same might be French, the challenge is certainly Spanish. Last year, Barcelona knocked Manchester City out of the Champions League. 12 months later, fate has thrown together for a rematch. We want to thrown together for a rematch. We wa nt to defeat want to defeat Barcelona. Not because revenge. Everything will be different. The experience of the competition this year is that it has been a good season. It will be a matter of winning the game. Indeed, City’s record in recent years is not pretty. Twice knocked out of the group stages. The only previous time they made the last 16, Barcelona proved too strong. They have a lot of quality players. They are showing in the Premier League that they are one of the best teams in the world. I hope that not this year but in the next years, they will be obviously fighting for this competition. This time last year, City were fighting for four trophies in 2015. They are already out of both Cup competitions and that could be to their advantage. We want to try to win as soon as we can, the Champions League. Every year, what... It is the next step for this group. defeat the best. The return to England of Luis Suarez, tests have seldom come tougher. Second-half goals from Duvan Zapata and Marek Hamsik saw third placed Napoli to a 2-0 win over Sassuolo in Italy’s Serie A on Monday. The victory means Rafa Benitez’s side close the gap on second placed Roma to three points while Inter managed by Roberto Mancini were 2-1 winners away to Cagliari managed by another former Italian international in Gianfranco Zola. The result lifts Inter six places to sixth on the table. While in Spain’s Primera Division, Levante have scored twice in the last two minutes to win their relegation clash at home to Granada. Next month, we’ll mark 500 days to go until the Rio Olympics get underway and this week IOC inspectors are in Brazil to rate the country’s preparations. Local news agencies reported four police officers were killed over the weekend in and around Rio de janeiro. It highlights the Brazilian city’s struggle to tame street violence ahead of the 2016 Olympics. There’s also a race to complete the venues, as Alex Webb reports. This is an Olympic Stadium in Rio, earlier this month. This is an Olympic Stadium in Rio, earlierthis month. Not earlier this month. Not a huge amount to a changed since IOC’s vice president claim that the country’s Olympic preparations were the worst recent memory. The Brazilian organising committee will be hoping that this week’s IOC inspection will show that the country is moving in the right direction and that the sport arenas, transport links, and hotels will all be ready in time. This poll vaulting legend is here ahead of it three-day board meeting later this week. He found the time to deliver a masterclass to young athletes at a military fort in Rio. He won gold in the pole vault in 1998. He had six successive world titles. He is convinced that the Brazilian people will ensure unforgettable games. Since the first day it went Rio was elected, I have been confident of success. To me, I connected to the Brazilian people. The celebration of sport, the celebration of the Olympics. This is what the Brazilian people can bring to the movement. Can create the atmosphere which no one can do the same. If they can keep up enough momentum, Rio will become the first South American city to host the Olympics. Alex Rodriguez reported to the New York Yankees Florida training base on Monday following a season-long suspension, arriving three days ahead of schedule. The 39-year-old missed the entire 2014 season after being suspended ~ I made a mistake. Iserved my I made a mistake. I served my time personally and professionally. My focus is now on 2015. How are you feeling physically? So far, so good. It is the first day. To me, the time of was to the benefit of me. Ifeel good, healthy, and ready to go. Roger Federer’s quest for a seventh title at the Dubai Tennis Championships got off to a relatively easy start on Monday with a 6-3, 6-1 first round win over Mikhail Youzhny. It was a 16th consecutive victory for the Swiss over the Russian in his first competitive match since losing in the third round to Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open. The 33-year-old hit the last of his eight aces on match point and needed just 56 minutes for the win. ~ I try to keep playing aggressive tennis. That is the way to win here in Dubai. Forthat tennis. That is the way to win here in Dubai. For that reason, in Dubai. Forthat reason, I’m happy that I stuck to plan. I started to get on a roll. That is always a good sign, when you are able to win many games ina sign, when you are able to win many games in a row, especially early on in a tournament. Meanwhile, last year’s French Open semi-finalist Ernests Gulbis has seen his disastrous start to the new season continue with the Latvian losing in the first round to Denis Istomin on Monday, the Uzbek winning 7-5, 6-2. At the Qatar Open, 2-time champion Victoria Azarenka powered through to the second round on Monday after a 6-0, 6-3 win over eighth seed Angelique Kerber. Azarenka, winner of this event in 2012 and 2013, missed the 2014 tournament due to injury but on her comeback needed just an hour and six minutes to dismiss last year’s beaten finalist. World Number 17 Venus Williams had to come from a set down to beat Australia’s Casey Dellacqua, eventually winning it 3-6, 6-2, 6-1. Elsewhere, Flavia Pennetta overcame losing the first set against Svetlana Kuznetsova. Penneta beat the Russian 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in windy conditions. This point in the fifth game of the final set setting up break point before the Italian wrapped up the match against the former French Open champion to move through to the last 16. From me and the rest of the Sport Today team, goodbye. A pretty wild and windy night for the UK. Showers continue to feed in all the way through to first light. While some of the showers will be as sleet and snow with the occasional rumble of thunder as well, temperatures will be low enough for some ice to form in the central and eastern areas. While we continue that showery and blustery theme through today, there will be some sunshine through the showers. The low pressure zone driving it all is starting to ease away. There’s a risk of flooding in the Bay of Biscay. Leaving that low pressure zone behind, just one or two showers. Wintry showers over the high ground but mostly as rain. The best of the driest and brightest weather will be along the south coast and in these eastern areas but pavements could still be slippery first thing. More showers in the north, and while these won’t be as wintry as what we saw on Monday morning, there will still be quite a few around. And the wind will add to the chill to start the day. Blustery winds and showers for many in the north-west, but not as many showers reaching the south-east. Some places will stay dry all day long. Showers will turn back into sleet and snow later for parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north-west of England. These are the temperatures for the afternoon. Again, the wind will make it feel colder. Tuesday night into Wednesday, the wind begins to ease. More cloud comes in from the Atlantic. Outbreaks of rain and not as cold to start the day on Wednesday. There will be frost in some places, but some places will start the day in double figures. The best of any brightness in the east. Temperatures will only slowly increase. In the west, underneath the cloud, temperatures in double figures. The most persistent showers over the hills with persistent hill fog. Wednesday night into Thursday, this area of low pressure in the north continues to drag in mild air. A much milder night for all of us to take things into Thursday. Showers clear from the south-east corner around lunchtime and early afternoon. Brighter skies behind and temperatures falling through the day, leaving sunshine but still feeling cold. Goodbye. Welcome to BBC News - broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. Our top stories. British police officers are in Turkey searching for three London schoolgirls thought to be trying tojoin Islamic State. Critics say the 2022 World Cup is being built by modern slavery. We witness the squalid conditions in Qatar. After the recent gains for pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine, President Putin says all-out war isn’t likely. It’s the Cuban cigar festival - and for the first time in decades Americans are able to take their purchases back home with them. Hello and welcome. British police officers are in Turkey searching for three schoolgirls from London. It’s thought they are planning tojoin Islamic State in Syria. The CIA believes IS may have up to 31,000 fighters in the region. And from that, it’s estimated 20,000 of them are foreign recruits travelling from almost 80 countries to fight with the extremist groups. The majority are from nearby Arab countries. But a quarter of the foreign fighters come from the West, with many crossing through Turkey. And it’s notjust men. Dozens of women have also travelled to Syria. Daniel Sandford reports on the search for the three missing UK school-girls. Shaken and bewildered, the pupils of Bethnal Green Academy in east London, arriving back at school after their half-term break, a half-term in which three bright teenage girls from the school, due to take their GCSEs this summer, ran away to Turkey. They seemed to be heading for the war and horror of the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. We are all shocked and deeply saddened by the news that three of our students have been reported missing from home. Our thoughts are with the families of the missing girls at this time. Police have advised us that there is no evidence that radicalisation of the missing students took place at the academy. But as pupils headed home this afternoon, there remained a concern that someone in this community, or on the internet, is grooming young women on behalf of the Islamic State. The three school friends flew out of Gatwick on Tuesday. They have not responded to e-mails, text messages or phone calls since. One had contacted a Scottish woman already in Syria on Twitter. She is a known recruiter for the Islamic State. The assumption is that they are trying tojoin her. This, in exclusive BBC pictures, is the most likely crossing point into Syria, a town where there is little sign of Turkish government control over the border. A people smuggler explained how foreign women get across the frontier into the so-called Islamic State. ""The handover is always done right on the border"", he told us. ""It is done in the presence of a female IS member who is with two IS fighters"". A local bus driver said there were few security checks. TRANSLATION: I have never seen anyone being stopped, no IDs being checked. But no-one the BBC spoke to in the town had seen the three British girls. What everyone at the school now wants is news that the girls are safe and returning home to East London, news that after six days still has not come. Daniel Sandford, BBC News, in Bethnal Green. Earlier I spoke to the spokesperson for the Council of Muslim American relations. I asked for the Council of Muslim American relations. Iasked if relations. I asked if it was also an American problem. To some degree it is an American problem. Not the same extent it is European problem. At last fall there was a case of three girls from Denver, Colorado, who tried to go to Syria. They were apprehended in Istanbul. I think the more Syria. They were apprehended in Istanbul. Ithink the more important question we should be asking is whether the more important-- what factors influencing them to travel to Syria. What question of community outreach? Surveillance would challenging. Any time we have had blanket surveillance of any communities, it has created a sense of alienation and stress. This has to be addressed working in conjunction with the Muslim community. They have the part of the solution. One of the questions we should be asking ourselves is what the role the community place. We should be making sure the established lines of communication are open. Some of these discussions are uncomfortable and awkward. Parents have to be able to establish their trust in their children. One thing I always tell parents is, if you are not talking to your children, other people. The message they are telling the children is not the message you want them to hear. New Zealand has announced it is to send almost 150 soldiers to Iraq as part of the fight against Islamic State militants. A statement by Prime Ministerjohn Key said the 143 soldiers would be sent in a non-combat role as part of the international coalition against the group. He attacked the militants’ outrageous actions. In a statement posted on his Twitter feed, Mr Key said ""sending our forces to Iraq is not an easy decision but it is the right decision"". Migrants working in Qatar on building projects associated with the 2022 World Cup are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions - and being prevented from leaving. The BBC has filmed undercover with the workers who HAD been promised reforms after international outrage at the high numbers of deaths and poor conditions. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan reports from Qatar, where football leaders gather on Tuesday to try to settle on a final date for the tournament. Doha is rising from the desert, the vast Khalifa Stadium, the flagship venue of the 2022 World Cup. One of the biggest construction projects in history, and all dependent on migrant labour. Here standards are high, but there is wider concern that on sites across the city Qatar has failed to act on worker deaths and its controversial kafala system, in which employers effectively own labourers and their ability to leave the country. These are the sprawling labour camps outside Doha. journalists are not allowed in here, but some of our team made it to three sites where many workers live 15 to a room and have to put up with conditions like these. Here, in one of the richest nations of the world. Talking to us anonymously they said there has been no improvement. TRANSLATION: I cannot leave Doha or buy my ticket back home, because I do not have my passport and I need an exit visa. TRANSLATION: I have been here 14 years and nothing has changed. Many get sick from working in the summer heat. There are barely any safety measures on the construction sites. A year ago FIFA pushed for reforms but the critics say they are still waiting. We have seen no change, the kafala system is still in place. It is a system of slavery in the 21st century, and it must change. Here, a few kilometres outside the centre of Doha is what will be an entire new city being built in order to host the World Cup finals. The 1.4 million migrant workers on vast construction projects like this one have received plenty of promises. The big question now is if Qatar has the appetite for real change. Qatar 2022 say World Cup projects like new stadia have adopted higher safety standards and universal rights are on the way. Wages will be paid electronically to cut corruption. The government would not comment, but those advising it urge patience. I think there are some areas where there is no doubt that workers are working in slave-like conditions. Yes, it is slow progress. We have to be patient, but it is ongoing and there is quite a momentum. Back at the labour camps, a kickabout for those building Qatar’s World Cup dream. Ahead of the most controversial sports event ever, their struggle for rights continues. Russian President Vladmir Putin says a war with Ukraine is unlikely. In an interview with Russian television, Mr Putin re-stated his support for the Minsk agreement that called for a ceasefire in East Ukraine. TRANSLATION: I believe that such an apocalyptic scenario is hardly possible. I hope that it will never come to this. In regards to some territories, these are things of an advantageous nature. It is not about returning territory to someone. The point is, the leadership of such a large European country as Ukraine should first of all bring the country back to normal life. Restore the economy and the social sphere. Put relations with the south-east of the country on the right track in a civilised way. And ensure the lawful rights and interests of the people who live there. in Canada and he has a book coming He joins us from Edmonton. Thank you for speaking with us. What is your reaction to President Putin’s comments? He says the Minsk agreement is the right path. That we have seen continuing fighting. Yes we have. It is a question whether this is a good time for a respite from all those concerned. I think it probably is. I believe that Putin’s commitment in Ukraine was never one of complete conquest. Other than Crimea. It was more to bring about a state where Ukraine is unable to gather its eastern territories. It is weaken significantly and is unable tojoin European is weaken significantly and is unable to join European structures or Nato. He has succeeded in this so far. But I believe even for Russia, this is a good time to take stock and see which the situation is. Looking at Mr Putin’s demeanour, it was with Russian television, he appeared confident and even smiled. Is he getting what he wants? It is very hard to determine what he wants. Many analysts have spent hours trying to ascertain exactly that. The fact is, the rebels have succeeded in their basic aims. They have consolidated their territory. They have defeated the Ukrainian army in the two rattles recently. -- battles. It opened up a link between the two major cities in the separatist zones. At the moment, he is quite satisfied with this. Russia’s commitment of 9000 troops, or as he would call them, volunteers, this is the limited contingent. Even though it is a dangerous one. This is not an invasion force. This is a force to cause trouble. That is why I think he might be so smug at the moment. We also have another deadline coming up. How optimistic argue that this will go ahead? Not very optimistic in the long-term. There are still issues that have never been resolved. How long will this go on? What kind of governments will be formed? Will the Ukrainian Parliament need to make constitutional changes to give some form of autonomy to these regimes? One thing for the President, he has got to get it through his parliament. It is far more radical than in recent memory. There will be problems ahead. What will happen next? Will the rebels tried to make a play for the port of Mariupol. It has fallen under threat. It is still a dangerous situation. I think Russia has an important role to play. It has never played the role of peacemaker. It has always been a catalyst to further problems. Ukraine has to take responsibility. We appreciate your time. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: She still can’t believe it. A single mother of four wins $188 million in an American lottery. First, let’s look at the stories making headlines in newspapers around the world. The Wall Street journal’s Asia edition writes about would-be jihadis travelling to Syria. The paper reports policy makers are faced with a difficult task: How to catch suspected militants without undermining Europe’s commitment to free movement. The japan Times reports on a new book about Islamic State, that’s been published in the US. The authors detail how the group uses religious justification for their violence. The South China Morning Post highlights the first drop in 20 years in the number of mainland tourists who went to Hong Kong for the Chinese New Year holiday. The China Daily has a critical take on the Oscars. It reports the winning films failed to connect with Chinese audiences. And The International New York Times has the personal problems and injuries faced by golfer Tiger Woods. It asks if there’s another golfer in the post-Woods era, who can captivate the audiences as much as he has. This is BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. The latest headlines: British police officers are in Turkey searching for three schoolgirls from London. It’s thought the girls are planning tojoin Islamic State in Syria. Migrant workers employed on World Cup projects in Qatar have told the BBC they’re still living in squalid conditions, despite promised improvements. An Egyptian court has sentenced one of the country’s most prominent pro-democracy activists to five years injail over his role in an illegal protest in 2013. Alaa Abd El-Fattah had originally been sentenced to 15 years for allegedly organizing the demonstration. The BBC’s Orla Guerin was in court and has this report. Passing El-Fattah and two dozen others. The leading activist Relatives overcome as all of the defendants were jailed just for attending a protest. Angry chants erupted in court. "" Down, down, "" with military rule. This man cried out to God and wept for his son. A Liberal opposition politician was among those at reduced to tears. We do not deserve to have our young people going to prison for three -5 years was taking part in a peaceful protest. This is leading to more anger among the young people of Egypt- anger among the young people of Egypt. In 2011, Alaa Abd El-Fattah harnessed the anger of the young to unseat Hosni Mubarak. He was hailed as an icon of the uprising. He and other revolutionaries are now targets of the regime. A renowned author was in court for the verdict. She told me that his family is relieved that he has only been jailed. We need to remember that this is not the worst that can happen. People are being shot and killed on the streets. If you have somebody been jailed for a while, this is not the worst thing that can happen. That itself is a comment on the situation in which we find ourselves. As she left court, this mother asks court to take revenge on Fpypts mother asks court to take revenge on Egypt’s president, General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and on the judge. The sentences handed down here today are another blow for those who took to the streets in 2011, hoping for change. Many prominent Liberal activist are now behind bars and in the so-called new Egypt, there is little room for dissent. Human rights campaigners say that there is less freedom here now than before the revolution. And it is notjust of the Liberals who are behind bars. Thousands of Islamist have been detained. This month, another 180 were sentenced to death. There are growing concerns about the rule of law here and about justice. Say the name ‘Kibera’ in Kenya and what comes to mind is one of the biggest, most rundown slums in Africa. Kibera is actually 15 villages that sprawled together in the heart of Nairobi. It is infamous for poverty, overcrowding, and an absence of sanitation. The Kenyan government’s made almost no effort to improve Kibera until now. The BBC’s Anne Soy reports. Home to one fifth of the population of Nairobi, these sprawling Kibera slum is very much part of the city. It is also home to many criminals. For a long time, the residents have lived in squalor. Lately, the youth of Kibera had been making their home a better place to live. It is all part of national youth empowerment programme. This is the new face of Kibera. We hope that eventually, even before they move to any other standards of housing, that this should be the minimum that people in Kibera live in. The houses should at least be decent. They should be permanent. They should have the basic standards of sanitation. The programme involves construction of roads, toilets, and installation of street and floodlights. Looking around this part of the slum, the only permanent building I can see is this toilet. Before, the residents use what they called a flying toilets. They put human waste in paper bags and through them as far as they could. When you look around, there are many. He could be where those landed. TRANSLATION: The flying toilets would make us sick. Now we will not catch diseases as often as before. TRANSLATION: I didn’t get a job. Now, I often as before. TRANSLATION: I didn’t get ajob. Now, I have didn’t get a job. Now, I have these projects. It is giving us cash. Not everyone is happy. TRANSLATION: I can see the change. But as a businesswoman, I have suffered. My customers were displaced to pave the way for road construction. There are challenges as you can see behind me. The youth here and those behind me, they are at Kollek. Within a span of 100m, you have to clinic. Instead, you should have lifted the one here. More than 3500 youth from the slums are paid to do the cleanup. There are also farming projects, fishing ponds, and grain millers. The project will wind up soon. The government hoped that the youth will run the businesses on their own. Many think that it will be short lived. Cigar enthusiasts from around 80 countries have gathered in the Cuban capital, Havana, for the country’s annual cigar festival. It comes amid new rules granting US visitors to Cuba permission to buy up to $100 worth of cigars, previously banned under Washington’s economic embargo on the communist island. The directors of some of the main cigar brands in Cuba are hopeful that improved ties will bring renewed investment and support for the country’s cigar industry. From Havana, Will Grant reports. Every year, the festival is the highlight Industry insiders around the world Whether the visitors are here just to make contacts, to order tobacco products and humidors, or simply soak up the atmosphere, this is one of the communist island’s premier trade events. This year, there is a key difference. Americans, previously banned from bringing them back into the US under the trade embargo, are now allowed to bring $100 of cigar products back in their luggage. This is the first time that we have ever been able to legally purchased them. Because some of us have been here before and purchased them underground. This is the first time that we can do it and we are very happy. The company behind the Cuban brand is a joint-venture with the government. They hope that the US economic embargo will be lifted as part of the current forum between nations, something that they say would be a major boost for the tobacco industry in the country. TRANSLATION: Ourfuture market share to reach in the US is 70%. It is clear that we will reach this in the long-term. While improved cigar sales are important for Cuba, the real matter of the thaw takes place on Friday when the Obama administration hosts a second round of talks with even government in Washington. the Cuban government in Washington. They hope to set out a timetable to reopen their embassies in each other’s capitals. Whatever the diplomats announced this week, for Americans, now able to smoke given cigars in Cuba itself, the door to the island has already reopened. In the United States, a single mother of four children has won $188 million in the lottery. Marie Holmes says she plans to go back to college to finish her degree and that she will now be able to provide for her four children. She had worked at Walmart and McDonalds but quit recently to take care of her kids who she says will be the ones benefiting from the win. It is not going to change the person that I am but it is going to change our situation financially. We will be able to have our own everything. We don’t have to worry about staying here or there. It is just going to be very fortunate for them. I can actually get them into programmes that help them. Look at these incredible photos. This was taken in Naples. Sinkholes have opened up. This one measures ten metres across. It was opened up a heavy rain and what investing underground. 380 people were evacuated from the edge of the crater. Luckily, it looks like nobody was hurt. Incredible pictures. You can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. We hope to hear from you. Goodbye for now. A pretty wild and windy night for the UK. Showers continue to feed in all the way through to first light. While some of the showers will be as sleet and snow with the occasional rumble of thunder as well, temperatures will be low enough for some ice to form in the central and eastern areas. While we continue that showery and blustery theme through today, there will be some sunshine through the showers. The low pressure zone driving it all is starting to ease away. There’s a risk of flooding in the Bay of Biscay. Leaving that low pressure zone behind, just one or two showers. Wintry showers over the high ground but mostly as rain. The best of the driest and brightest weather will be along the south coast and in these eastern areas but pavements could still be slippery first thing. More showers in the north, and while these won’t be as wintry as what we saw on Monday morning, there will still be quite a few around. And the wind will add to the chill to start the day. Blustery winds and showers for many in the north-west, but not as many showers reaching the south-east. Some places will stay dry all day long. Showers will turn back into sleet and snow later for parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north-west of England. These are the temperatures for the afternoon. Again, the wind will make it feel colder. Tuesday night into Wednesday, the wind begins to ease. More cloud comes in from the Atlantic. Outbreaks of rain and not as cold to start the day on Wednesday. There will be frost in some places, but some places will start the day in double figures. The best of any brightness in the east. Temperatures will only slowly increase. In the west, underneath the cloud, temperatures in double figures. The most persistent showers over the hills with persistent hill fog. Wednesday night into Thursday, this area of low pressure in the north continues to drag in mild air. A much milder night for all of us to take things into Thursday. Showers clear from the south-east corner around lunchtime and early afternoon. Brighter skies behind and temperatures falling through the day, leaving sunshine but still feeling cold. Goodbye. ~ The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. British police officers are in Turkey searching for three schoolgirls from London. It’s thought the girls are heading to Syria in order tojoin the group known as Islamic State. The Turkish government has criticised the British authorities for taking too long to inform it that the three girls were travelling through its territory. A BBC investigation has found that migrants working on building projects in Qatar associated with the 2022 World Cup are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions - and being prevented from leaving the country. Workers had been promised reforms after international outrage at the high numbers of deaths and poor conditions. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said a war between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely. Speaking on Russian television, Mr Putin stressed his support for the peace deal for eastern Ukraine, which was negotiated in Minsk and approved by the United Nations Security Council. And here in the UK, Labour’s jack Straw and Conservative Sir Malcolm Rifkind have referred themselves to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, over allegations of cash for access. Now on BBC News all the latest business news live from Singapore. The ripple effect of the big drop in the price of oil. We investigate the impact on the wider industry. And meet the people who say Abenomics needs to do much more if they are going to benefit. Welcome to Asia Business Report. The price of oil has dipped again. Ending what could be considered a rally. In a special look at the drop, we are looking at the dramatic decline in $150 in june 2014 to less than $50 earlier this year. This has ramifications beyond the buyers and sellers of fuel. Singapore is one of the world’s busiest ports. It is packed with tugboats and supply vessels. A 24-hour operation servicing the shipping industry. In among it all, an oil rig. This is a drilling rig. It drills the wells and once they are complete, it moves on to the next job. The number of rigs actively drilling in any one point in time is considered a good gauge of the health of the industry. This one is here because it recently lost its contract. Nobody wants it. With lower oil prices, demand for drilling services has dropped dramatically. So many of the rigs in Singapore are here. Effectively putting to storage of anchorages across the region. In Southeast Asia alone, there are around 182 rigs. Less than half of them are currently in service. David Griffin’s company repairs and maintains rigs. If you look at the rig utilisation rate, which looks at the number of rigs in the industry and are available, there is an increasing number of rigs becoming idle. For the drilling industry as a whole, we are seeing less income, less revenue for drilling companies and all subsequent service companies. A few kilometres away, this man runs another business servicing the oil industry. He points out that while rig demand is down, new rigs ordered before the plunge are still rolling off the production line. When was the last time you saw it like this? When there was a drop in prices. Similar situation. The rigs are all stacked. There is no work. We are seeing a lot of rigs in Singapore. It is a big manufacturing base. Are they going to get work? I am not sure. Most of the oil companies are suspending budgets for this year and next year. Oil rigs are a massive investment. There is a lot of money waiting for better times. In other business news making headlines, Honda says its chief executive will be stepping down injune. He will be succeeded by a long-term executive injune. HSBC reported a 17% fall in profits last year to just over $18 billion. The bank had helped people evade paying UK taxes using hidden accounts in Geneva. And the chief executive used a Swiss bank account to hold his bonuses. Shares in BHP Billiton are recording 2% gains today. They are hoping to make savings by slashing capital and expiration -- exploration spending. Attempts to jumpstart the japanese economy are also being dragged down by falling oil prices. Some members of the central bank are doubting whether the target of 2% inflation is achievable. They will be assessing the state of the world’s third biggest economy. Stock prices are soaring and big companies are doing well. But not everyone is benefiting from Shinzo Abe’s economic policies. This is how fishermen of this town start their day. One last chance to warm up. Then they set sail. In search of seaweed. just an hour later, they are back. Baskets full of what they call nori, a staple of the japanese diet for many centuries. It is a $2 billion industry across the country. For this town, the biggest part of its economy. But to turn their catch into something ready for consumers, it takes machines which cost almost $200,000. What was done manually before is no longer viable, to produce dried nori sheets in bulk. This ageing industry is struggling to keep up and could badly use a boost which it is not getting. TRANSLATION: Abenomics may be helping big companies, but prime industry has not felt the benefit at all. We are affected by the weather and oil prices. Selling it is also hard. This man has been doing that for 40 years. When he started, there was no sales tax. Recently, it has been raised from 5% to 8%. TRANSLATION: of course that affects our sales. Customers get used to it, but I can feel their belts tightening. In the government, plans to raise the sales tax. TRANSLATION: I only buy necessities now. After the tax hike, I hesitate to buy anything expensive. Even a 10%, it is still relatively low compared to other developed economies. Shinzo Abe argues that it needed to go up to tackle japan’s economy. But this port town is just one example of many rural cities that are struggling. Disparity is a word they heard repeatedly. With Abenomics, the benefits need to be felt across japan. As much questions are they might like to claim the recent recovery is Shinzo Abe’s doing, there are still questions over the impact of his policies. I asked if small-business operators are being neglected. It is a problem we have had for a long time injapan. The big companies have expanding markets overseas which helps them. In japan the markets overseas which helps them. Injapan the effect takes longer. For the economy to trickle down. This is because the regional economies don’t get the money printed directly and they don’t see their markets expanding while the old business model over the last 15 years of cutting costs is over because the costs are rising and it squeezes them. Is that the failure of Abenomics? That it takes time for the printed money and the yen to trickle down to the small and medium-sized companies? It was a problem we have had for a long time and it is the deflation in the environment. Every time the economy picks up, the small companies are getting squeezed. When the japanese economy was picking up, bankruptcies of smaller companies were going up as well. They were squeezed during the batter time and the reason is that interest rates were going up and so were their costs and they see others driving but it is not them. Then they commit suicide and go bankrupt and this time is quite a bit better than the last time. What more can we expect from Shinzo Abe and his Abenomics for the small and medium-sized companies to benefit in different from the old days in which lower costs were the only thing talking about that. It is a mindset of deflation and what now needs to come in our new opportunities and new markets. They need deregulation. The transpacific partnership will help business overall in getting the market pushed and pulled and that is what needs to be done. For more on our series please visit our website.

The Archbishop of Canterbury has admitted that some churches including his own are not paying staff a living wage. The Church of England has been accused of hypocrisy. Now we go to our correspondent. A church under hostile fire as conservative politicians launched a barrage of criticism. It emerged today that despite calling on employers to pay the living wage, the church itself is not always practising what it preaches. Some church job ads shall pay levels below them living wage for example at Pickering Church. And at Lichfield Cathedral, and even Canterbury Cathedral itself. It’s embarrassing. We would prefer to be there and we are getting there as quicky as we can. We have to do so in a way responsible to all employees. Bishops and archbishops have come under attack from everything to living in palaces to the level of their own wages. In this pastoral letter, they say they see the burgeoning of in-work poverty, that people work hard but can’t earn enough to live decently. That is why they say they are backing the concept of the living wage. This Conservative MP terms that hypocrisy by the church. It is as out of touch with ordinary people as any other organisation is and they prove that by criticising the Government, saying people on a minimum wage cannot live with dignity while at the same time paying their own employees the minimum wage. The Church of England cannot have its cake and eat it. But how do those employees feel? At a student, this man worked as a tour guide at Canterbury Cathedral earning the minimum wage. My personal experience was brilliant and more important than the salary paid was the opportunity to contribute to the cathedral itself. Everyday working there, you feel part of something bigger, history, and that’s important. The archbishops say more cathedrals, and parishes, are aiming to pay the living wage by 2017 in that no institution on earth is perfect. Police in Ca nada Police in Canada say they have uncovered a tunnel dug near a venue for a major sporting competition this summer. The seven metre long tunnel was found in Toronto where the Pan-American games will be held injuly. It was the Pan-American games will be held in july. It was discovered injuly. It was discovered near a tennis stadium on the campus of York University which can hold up to 12,500 people. Police are expected to release more details soon and we will go to our correspondent who has the sports. This is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up on this programme: just hours from now, a decision will be made on when the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be played. Manchester City welcome Barcelona as they play the first leg of their last 16 Champions League tie on Tuesday. And after a season-long suspension, the New York Yankees baseballer Alex Rodriguez returns to pre-season training three days early. Hello and welcome to the programme, where it’s football news we start with and a decision is expected on Tuesday as to what part of the year in 2022 the Qatar Football World Cup will be staged. But first, the Cricket World Cup, where the West Indies are taking on Zimbabwe. The West Indies won the toss and chose to bat and has moved -- have moved into six for one. For more information, you can go to our website. We are keeping you up-to-date on the real-time basis. Fears over the excessive heat have meant holding the World Cup during Qatar’s summer are almost impossible. But as our sports news correspondent, Richard Conway, reports, the alternative dates being suggested won’t be met with sport and yet, this week here in the capital, they may get a resolution. when this tournament can be played. The President of FIFA decreed that it will still be too hot in the summer. It reaches up to 45 Celsius. He felt that it had to be moved. A range of other people in the game agree with him. The question is when. Moving into the winter causes disruption to the domestic leagues. European voices have said that if it can’t be held when it was originally supposed to be held, it can’t be held here at all. What we get from the taskforce is an announcement that it will be moved to November and December. That is what I have been told. I have been told that it is the only option. january-February do not work because of the clash with the Winter Olympics. May does not work because it is too close tojune. Well, according to Hassan Al-Thawadi, the head of Qatar’s World Cup organising committee, they’re ready to comply with whatever decision is taken on Tuesday. We have always adhered to the football community’s decision. The task force that is meeting tomorrow and will be making a recommendation for the executive committee to make a decision has members of many different representative football communities. In the end, whatever decision comes, we are ready to host it at any point in time. In the end, the football community decides. The taskforce represents many people in the community and whatever decision gets made, we are ready to comply. The UEFA Champions League last 16 continues on Tuesday with two more first-leg ties. juventus host Borussia Dortmund in Turin, while Barcelona travel to Manchester City in perhaps the most intriguing of the matches, as the hosts have a score or two to settle. Ben Croucher reports. Deja vu. The saying might be French but the challenge is certainly Spanish. Last year, Barcelona knocked Manchester City out of the Champions League. 12 months later, fate has thrown them together for a rematch. We wa nt to defeat Barcelona. Not because of revenge. Everything will be different. The experience of the competition this year is that it has been a good season. It will be a matter of winning the game. Indeed, City’s record in recent years is not pretty. Twice knocked out of the group stages. The only previous time they made the last 16, Barcelona proved too strong. They have a lot of quality players. They are showing in the Premier League that they are one of the best teams in the world. They are already out of both Cup competitions and that could be to their advantage. We want to try to win as soon as we can, the Champions League. Every year, we are trying to improve in domestic games and also in the Champions League. That is what... It is the next step for this group. To be the best, you have to defeat the best. The return to England of Luis Suarez, tests have seldom come tougher. Second-half goals from Duvan Zapata and Marek Hamsik saw third-placed Napoli to a 2-0 win over Sassuolo in Italy’s Serie A on Monday. The victory means Rafa Benitez’s side close the gap on second-placed Roma to three points while Inter, managed by Roberto Mancini, were 2-1 winners away to Cagliari, managed by another former Italian international in Gianfranco Zola. The result lifts Inter six places to sixth on the table. In Spain’s Primera Division, Levante have scored twice in the last two minutes to win their relegation clash at home to Granada. Next month we’ll mark 500 days to go until the Rio Olympics get underway and this week, IOC inspectors are in Brazil to rate the country’s preparations. Local news agencies reported four police officers were killed over the weekend in and around Rio de janeiro. It highlights the Brazilian city’s struggle to tame street violence ahead of the 2016 Olympics. There’s also a race to complete the venues, as Alex Webb reports. This is an Olympic Stadium in Rio, earlier this month. Not a huge amount has changed since IOC’s vice president claimed that the country’s Olympic preparations were the worst recent memory. The Brazilian organising committee will be hoping that this week’s IOC inspection will show that the country is moving in the right direction and that the sport arenas, public transport links and hotels will all be ready in time. This pole vaulting legend is here ahead a three-day IOC board meeting later this week. He found the time to deliver a masterclass to young athletes at a military fort in Rio. He won gold in the pole vault in 1998. He had six successive world titles. He is convinced that the Brazilian people will ensure unforgettable Games. Since the first day when Rio was elected, I have been confident of success. To me, I am connected to the Brazilian people. The celebration of sport, the celebration of the Olympics. This is what the Brazilian people can bring to the movement, can create the atmosphere which no one can do the same. If they can keep up enough momentum, Rio will become the first South American city to host the Olympics. Alex Rodriguez reported to the three days ahead of schedule. The 39-year-old missed the entire 2014 season after being suspended for violations of baseball’s drug agreement and labour contract, implicated in MLB’s investigation of the Biogenesis of America clinic. The suspension cost Rodriguez $22.13 million of his $25 million salary last year. I made a mistake. I served a big penalty, personally and professionally. My focus is now on 2015. REPORTER: How are you feeling physically? So far, so good. It is the first day. For me, the time of was to the benefit of me. Ifeel good, healthy, and ready to go. Roger Federer’s quest for a seventh title at the Dubai Tennis Championships got off to a relatively easy start on Monday with a 6-3, 6-1 first-round win over Mikhail Youzhny. It was a 16th consecutive victory for the Swiss over the Russian in his first competitive match since losing in the third round to Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open. The 33-year-old hit the last of his eight aces on match point and needed just 56 minutes for the win. Meanwhile, last year’s French Open semifinalist Ernests Gulbis has seen his disastrous start to the new season continue, losing in the first round to Denis Istomin on Monday, the Uzbek winning 7-5, 6-2. At the Qatar Open, two-time champion Victoria Azarenka powered through to the second round on Monday after a 6-0, 6-3 win over eighth seed Angelique Kerber. Azarenka, winner of this event in 2012 and 2013, missed the 2014 tournament due to injury, but on her comeback needed just an hour and six minutes to dismiss last year’s beaten finalist. World number 17, Venus Williams, had to come from a set down to beat Australia’s Casey Dellacqua, eventually winning it 3-6, 6-2, 6-1. And returning to that World Cup cricket match between the West Indies and Zimbabwe. The West Indies won the toss and decided to bat. They are 20 for one . More information on our website.

Our top stories: British police officers are in Turkey searching for three London schoolgirls thought to be trying tojoin Islamic State. Critics say the 2022 World Cup is being built by modern slavery. We witness the squalid conditions in Qatar. After the recent gains for pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine, President Putin says all-out war isn’t likely. Hello and welcome. British police officers are in Turkey searching for three schoolgirls from London. It’s thought they are planning tojoin Islamic State in Syria. The CIA believes IS may have up to 31,000 fighters in the region. And from that, it’s estimated 20,000 of them are foreign recruits, travelling from almost 80 countries to fight with the extremist groups. The majority are from nearby Arab countries. But a quarter of the foreign fighters come from the West, with many crossing through Turkey. And its notjust men. Dozens of women have also travelled to Syria. Daniel Sandford reports on the search for the three missing UK school-girls. Shaken and bewildered, the pupils of Bethnal Green Academy in east London, arriving back at school after their half-term break, a half-term in which three bright teenage girls from the school, due to take their GCSEs this summer, ran away to Turkey. They seemed to be heading for the war and horror of the self-styled Islamic State in Syria. We are all shocked and deeply saddened by the news that three of our students have been reported missing from home. Our thoughts are with the families of the missing girls at this time. Police have advised us that there is no evidence that radicalisation of the missing students took place at the academy. But as pupils headed home this afternoon, there remained a concern that someone in this community, or on the internet, is grooming young women on behalf of the Islamic State. The three school friends flew out of Gatwick on Tuesday. They have not responded to e-mails, text messages or phone calls since. One had contacted a Scottish woman already in Syria on Twitter. She is a known recruiter for the Islamic State. The assumption is that they are trying tojoin her. This, in exclusive BBC pictures, is the most likely crossing point into Syria, a town where there is little sign of Turkish government control over the border. A people smuggler explained how foreign women get across the frontier into the so-called Islamic State. ""The handover is always done right on the border"", he told us. ""It is done in the presence of a female IS member who is with two IS fighters"". A local bus driver said there were few security checks. TRANSLATION: I have never seen anyone being stopped, no IDs being checked. But no-one the BBC spoke to in the town had seen the three British girls. What everyone at the school now wants is news that the girls are safe and returning home to East London, news that after six days still has not come. Daniel Sandford, BBC News, in Bethnal Green. Earlier I spoke to Zainab Chaudry, spokesperson for the Council on American Relations and I asked her if Europe’s problem of Islamic State managing to entice young people was also an American problem. ~ I think, to some degree it is an American problem. Not to the same extent as it is a European problem butjust last extent as it is a European problem but just last autumn butjust last autumn there was a case of three girls from Denver, Colorado who attempted to travel to Syria and were apprehended in Istanbul and returned home to their families. I think the more important question we should be asking is, what are the factors that are influencing these girls to travel to Syria and how can. Them from going there? What can be done, in your opinion, to tackle this? Is it a question of surveillance or community outreach? Surveillance actually would community, it will create a sense of alienation and mistrust within the conjunction with the Muslim community. Muslims have to be part of the solution, part of whatever solution authorities use to help insure that Muslim teens, especially young girls and boys, are not being put into the hands of ISIS. One of the questions we should be asking ourselves is what is the role the community plays? Parents and families have a very important role in making sure they established open lines of communication with the youth. A lot of these discussions are uncomfortable and awkward but parents have to be able to establish that trust with their children to make sure that the messages they are getting across is one they want to hear. One thing I always tell parents is that if you are not talking to your children, other people are and the message they are telling your children is probably not the message you want them to hear. New Zealand has announced it is to send almost 150 soldiers to Iraq as part of the fight against Islamic State militants. A statement by Prime Ministerjohn Key said the 143 soldiers would be sent in a non-combat role as part of the international coalition against the group. He attacked the militants’ ""outrageous actions"". In a statement posted on his Twitter feed, Mr Key said ""sending our forces to Iraq is not an easy decision but it is the right decision."" Migrants working in Qatar on building projects associated with the 20-22 World Cup are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions and being prevented from leaving. The BBC has filmed undercover with the workers who HAD been promised reforms after international outrage at the high numbers of deaths and poor conditions. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan reports from Qatar, where football leaders gather on Tuesday to try to settle on a final date for the tournament. Doha is rising from the desert, the vast Khalifa Stadium, the flagship venue of the 2022 World Cup. One of the biggest construction projects in history, and all dependent on migrant labour. Here standards are high, but there is wider concern that on sites across the city Qatar has failed to act on worker deaths and its controversial kafala system, in which employers effectively own labourers and their ability to leave the country. These are the sprawling labour camps outside Doha. journalists are not allowed in here, but some of our team made it to three sites where many workers live 15 to a room and have to put up with conditions like these. Here, in one of the richest nations of the world. Talking to us anonymously they said there has been no improvement. ""I cannot leave Doha"", this Nepalese man tells us, ""or buy my ticket back home, because I do not have my passport and I need an exit visa"". TRANSLATION: I have been here 14 years and nothing has changed. Many workers get sick, there are barely any safety measures on the construction sites. A year ago FIFA pushed for reforms, but the critics say they are still waiting. We have seen no change, the kafala system is still in place. It is a system of slavery in the 21st century, and it must change. Here, a few kilometres outside the centre of Doha is what will be an entire new city being built in order to host the World Cup finals. The 1.4 million migrant workers on vast construction projects like this one have received plenty of promises. The big question now is if Qatar has the appetite for real change. Qatar 2022 say World Cup projects like new stadia have adopted higher safety standards and universal rights are on the way. Wages will be paid electronically to cut corruption. The Qatari government would not comment, but those advising it urge patience. I think there are some areas where there is no doubt that workers are working in slave-like conditions. Yes, it is slow progress. We have to be patient, but it is ongoing and there is quite a momentum. Back at the labour camps, a kickabout for those building Qatar’s World Cup dream. Ahead of the most controversial sports event ever, their struggle for rights continues. Russian President Vladmir Putin says an all-out war with Ukraine is unlikely. In an interview with Russian television, Mr Putin re-stated his support for the Minsk agreement that called for a ceasefire in East Ukraine. TRANSLATION: I believe that such an apocalyptic scenario is hardly possible. I hope that it will never come to this. In regards to some territories, these are things of an advantageous nature. It is not about returning territory to someone. The point is, the leadership of such a large European country as Ukraine should first of all bring the country back to normal life. Restore the economy and the social sphere. Put relations with the south-east of the country on the right track in a civilised way. And ensure the lawful rights and interests of the people who live there. If the Minsk Agreement is implemented, I am sure this is what will be done. A court in New York has found the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Palestinian Authority liable for attacks in and around jerusalem, during the second Palestinian intifada. The jury awarded victims of the attacks more than $218 million. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has the details from Washington. It is a really interesting case brought by ten American families. You talked about the number of people killed and injured in those six attacks that these were specifically referring to between 2002 and 2004, and these ten American families either lost relatives or had victims who were injured as a result. In New York, we heard testimony from those who were injured, reliving the horrors of the attacks. What the jury was deciding was whether these attacks, which were carried out by militant groups, by Hamas and Al-Aqsa Brigade, for example, whether the Palestinian Authority or the Palestinian Liberation Organisation were officially behind these attacks, whether they sanctioned these attacks. And these 12 jury members decided that indeed they were officially sanctioned by these organisations and, as such, those groups were liable for this huge pay-out for many millions of dollars of compensation. Rats haven’t always received the best press, but their image may be about to get a bit of a boost. It turns out they may not have been responsible for the Black Death after all. Black rats have always been blamed for spreading the bubonic plague, but now scientists say gerbils, from Asia, may in fact have been responsible. They found outbreaks in Europe were strongly linked to periods of warm and wet weather in Central Asia. Those are conditions in which the population of gerbils, and the fleas living on them, boomed. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come: Could the solution to peanut allergies be to eat more peanuts? We’ll have more on some surprising findings. First, let’s look at the stories making headlines in newspapers around the world. The Wall Street journal’s Asia edition writes about would-be jihadis travelling to Syria. The paper reports policy makers are faced with a difficult task: How to catch suspected militants without undermining Europe’s commitment to free movement. The japan Times reports on a new book about Islamic State, that’s been published in the US. The authors detail how the group uses religious justification for their violence. The South China Morning Post highlights the first drop in 20 years in the number of mainland tourists who went to Hong Kong for the Chinese New Year holiday. The China Daily has a critical take on the Oscars. It reports the winning films failed to connect with Chinese audiences. And The International New York Times has the personal problems and injuries faced by golfer Tiger Woods. It asks if there’s another golfer in the post-Woods era, who can captivate the audiences as much as he has. This is BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. The latest headlines: British police officers are in Turkey searching for three schoolgirls from London. It’s thought the girls are planning tojoin Islamic State in Syria. Migrant workers employed on World Cup projects in Qatar have told the BBC they’re still living in squalid conditions, despite promised improvements. North Korea calls them exercises of war but South Korea says they are just defensive in nature. The government in Seoul hasjust announced its annual military exercises with the United States will start on March 2. In the past, it’s led to a surge in tensions, with Pyongyang threatening pre-emptive nuclear strikes and attacks on South Korean and US targets. Our correspondent in Seoul, Stephen Evans, has this report. Korean and American troops train side-by-side in routine regular wargames. The upcoming truly huge exercise will involve about 200,000 troops, American and Korean, combining in one of the biggest drills of its kind. Submarines, ground-troops and bombers co-ordinated across the country. The aim ofjoint exercises is to make sure troops speaking different languages combine smoothly. In a time of war, we will be able to operate together effectively and efficiently so we will be able to defend the Republic of Korea from any aggression. This training helps us remain ready to deter aggression and should anyone be foolish enough to attack the Republic of Korea, we will be able to rapidly defeat them. This exercise is about making the co-operation between two militaries who literally speak a different language more effective. But is also about sending a message that an attack on South Korea is also an attack on the United States. just across the border, North Korea also holds exercises, practicing rapid landings of thousands of troops. It says its wargames are about defence because of the South and the threat of invasion and it has called this year’s South Korean-American maneuvers to be halted. We propose to the United States that the United States should, at least this year, temporarily suspend military exercises. The large-scale wargames in South Korea are the root cause of the escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula and the danger of nuclear warfacing the Korean nation. The Americans are geared up North Korea has indicated that if the maneuvers happen, it may hold a fourth nuclear test. Tense times ahead. Intense fighting is continuing in Myanmar’s border region of Kokang. State media says at least 140 soldiers and rebels have been killed in the last two weeks in Kokang, which is in the northern part of Shan state, next to China. They say an unknown number of civilians have died as well. Our correspondentjonah Fisher is in Yangon. He explains what the rebels’ political agenda is likely to be. These rebels were driven out effectively of Kokang region in 2009. The Burmese army moved into this sliver of land on the border with China and forced them out and force their leader into China. What has happened in the last few weeks that we have seen has been them trying to move back in to regain that territory and regain influence and that is why we have seen these clashes taking place with the Burmese military. The Burmese government put in place a new, more pro-China government in 2004 and are trying to stop the rebel movement taking their territory. Cigar enthusiasts from around 80 countries have gathered in the Cuban capital, Havana, for the country’s annual cigar festival. It comes amid new rules granting US visitors to Cuba permission to buy up to $100 worth of cigars, previously banned under Washington’s economic embargo on the communist island. The directors of some of the main cigar brands in Cuba are hopeful that improved ties will bring renewed investment and support for the country’ cigar industry. From Havana, Will Grant reports. Every year, this is the highlight of the true cigar aficionado’s calendar. Industry insiders from around the world gather in Cuba to sample some of the country’s most iconic export. Many people here are soaking up the atmosphere at one of the communist island’s premier events. This year, there is a major difference. Americans, previously banned from bringing cigars back into the US under the trade embargo, are now permitted to carry up to $100 worth in their luggage. This is the first time we have ever been able to legally purchase, because some of us have purchased underground, but for us, this is the first and we can do it properly and we are very happy. The company behind Cuban cigar brands is a joint venture with the Cuban government. They are hopeful the US economic embargo will be lifted as part of the thaw in relations. That would be a major boost for the country’s tobacco industry. TRANSLATION: Our future market shares in the US could reach 70%. It is clear that we will reach this in the long-term. But while improved cigar sales are important for Cuba, the real matter takes place on Friday, when the takes place on Friday, when Obama administration hosts a second round of talks. It is hoped that embassies will reopen in the capital cities of both countries. For the cigar enthusiasts who have made it this event, the very fact they can buy and smoke Cuban tobacco Cuban soil means that for them, this though is already well under way. -- this thaw. New research suggests that contrary to accepted health advice, allowing babies to eat peanuts can help them avoid a peanut allergy. The British study, published in the New England journal of Medicine, is the first to suggest that eating certain foods can prevent allergies. The carefully-controlled trial involved 628 babies who were all at high risk of developing a peanut allergy. In the group who avoided peanut products completely, 17% were allergic to them by the age of five. Butjust 3% of the group who ate regular peanut snacks developed an allergy. One of the biggest, most rundown slums in Nairobi is influence -- infamous for poverty, overcrowding and an absence of sanitation. The Kenyan government has made almost no effort to improve the area until now. Home to one fifth of the population of Nairobi, the sprawling Kibera slum is very much part of the city. It is a source of cheap labour and is also home to many criminals. For a long time, the residents have lived in squalor. Lately, the youth of Kibera had been making their home a better place to live. It is all part of national youth empowerment programme. This is the new face of Kibera. We hope that eventually, even before they move to any other standards of housing, that this should be the minimum that people in Kibera live in. The houses should at least be decent. They should be permanent. They should have the basic standards of sanitation. The programme involves construction of roads, clinics and toilets, and installation of street and floodlights. Before, the residents use what they called a flying toilets. They put human waste in paper bags and threw them as far as they could. When you look around, there are many... He could be where those landed. TRANSLATION: The flying toilets would make us sick. Now, we will not catch diseases as often as before. Myself, I have done a course . I didn’t get a job but now, I have these projects. It is giving us cash. Not everyone is happy. TRANSLATION: I can see the change. But as a businesswoman, I have suffered. My customers were displaced to pave the way for road construction. There are challenges, as you can see behind me. The youth here and those behind me, they are at a clinic. Within a span of 100m, you have two clinics. Instead, you should uplift the one here. More than 3500 youth from the slums are paid to do the cleanup. There are also urban farming projects, fishing ponds, and grain millers. The project will wind up soon. The government hoped that the youth will run the businesses on their own. But skeptics think that it will be short lived. In the United States, a single mother of four children has won $188 million in the lottery. Marie Holmes says she plans to go back to college to finish her degree and that she’ll now be able to provide for her four children. She had worked at Walmart and McDonalds but quit recently to take care of her kids, who she says will be the ones benefiting from the win. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But what happens when life gives you oranges? Throw them violently at your neighbours! That is how things are done here in Mexico. These pictures are from a festival in the centre of the country. The event marks the beginning of the sowing season and has been held for 150 years. It is opposed to bring rain and good harvest and it also looks like a lot of fun. -- it is supposed to bring. And there is plenty more information on our website. You can get in contact with me and the rest of the team on Twitter. Thank you for your company. A pretty wild and windy night for the UK. Showers continue to feed in all the way through to first light. While some of the showers will be as sleet and snow with the occasional rumble of thunder as well, temperatures will be low enough for some ice to form in the central and eastern areas. While we continue that showery and blustery theme through today, there will be some sunshine through the showers. The low pressure zone driving it all is starting to ease away. There’s a risk of flooding in the Bay of Biscay. Leaving that low pressure zone behind, just one or two showers. Wintry showers over the high ground but mostly as rain. The best of the driest and brightest weather will be along the south coast and in these eastern areas but pavements could still be slippery first thing. More showers in the north, and while these won’t be as wintry as what we saw on Monday morning, there will still be quite a few around. And the wind will add to the chill to start the day. Blustery winds and showers for many in the north-west, but not as many showers reaching the south-east. Some places will stay dry all day long. Showers will turn back into sleet and snow later for parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north-west of England. These are the temperatures for the afternoon. Again, the wind will make it feel colder. Tuesday night into Wednesday, the wind begins to ease. More cloud comes in from the Atlantic. Outbreaks of rain and not as cold to start the day on Wednesday. There will be frost in some places, but some places will start the day in double figures. The best of any brightness in the east. Temperatures will only slowly increase. In the west, underneath the cloud, temperatures in double figures. The most persistent showers over the hills with persistent hill fog. Wednesday night into Thursday, this area of low pressure in the north continues to drag in mild air. A much milder night for all of us to take things into Thursday. Showers clear from the south-east corner around lunchtime and early afternoon. Brighter skies behind and temperatures falling through the day, leaving sunshine but still feeling cold. Goodbye. ~ The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Laura Westbrook. British police officers are in Turkey searching for three schoolgirls from London. It’s thought the girls are heading to Syria in order tojoin the group known as Islamic State. The Turkish government has criticised the British authorities for taking too long to inform it that the three girls were travelling through its territory. A BBC investigation has found that migrants working on building projects in Qatar associated with the 2022 World Cup are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions - and being prevented from leaving the country. Workers had been promised reforms after international outrage at the high numbers of deaths and poor conditions. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said a war between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely. Speaking on Russian television, Mr Putin stressed his support for the peace deal for eastern Ukraine, which was negotiated in Minsk and approved by the United Nations Security Council. Now on BBC News, it’s time for HARDtalk. It is with the country’s Foreign Minister. What chance is there for peace in Ukraine? There is meant to be a ceasefire in place, but fighting has continued, and the deal agreed in Minsk left many issues unresolved. The crisis has pitted Russia against the west in a way not seen since the Cold War. And there is no sign of either side backing down. HARDtalk speaks to Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s deputy Foreign Minister and asks: What hopes does he have of pulling the country back from civil war? Vadym Prystaiko, welcome to HARDtalk. How hopeful are you that this ceasefire will hold in Ukraine? I am quite hopeful. I have been trying to help it along so these results that we are seeing right now, they are not what we expected, but at least there is a ceasefire and we’re losing less and less men these days. So you are confident that the ceasefire will lead to some more permanent peace? I believe that is the important first stage and without it it goes nowhere. We can start removing the heavy artillery and we could not do that without the ceasefire which needs to be verified. So the Ukrainian government will withdraw all heavy weaponry from the east of the country? It is not from the East. We have a special schedule where the artillery is going 50 km and the big artillery 70 km and the rest of its 40 km. We are not withdrawing it all the way because it is our territory after all. That irrespective of what the pro- Russian rebels do, the government in Kiev will pull back Ukrainian soldiers, government soldiers, from that area? That is what was signed in Minsk and that is what we’re going to respect. Is not the soldiers yet, just the heavy artillery which we both have the ability to hit hard on the targets including the rebels and the Ukrainian forces and then we will talk about the soldiers with rifles. But is it your understanding that, effectively, fighting between the two sides has stopped? It has stopped but unfortunately we have seen it before. It is not the first ceasefire our president has proposed. We have seen it before and each and every time it was not respected by either side. Now we have more than 600 where kilometres captured after the ceasefire allegedly agreed by both sides. Your Prime Minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, said you had two options about the peace deal which was negotiated in Minsk between President Putin, the German chancellor and the French President, and they were bad and worse and they went for the bad option. He said it was better to have the deal than have it but from what you are saying, there is hope and it may not turn out to be such a bad deal? If it is such a bad deal, we would never have come to it. We understand that there are shortcomings in the deal but I have to tell you, as painful and humiliating as it is, if we are seriously considering how to get peace to these areas of Ukraine, it is probably the best resolution is an acceptance on your part that you will have to, Russia and to pro- Russian rebels, those who would rather look towards Russia? It is not giving up. Right now it is what we are already losing. We told them we would stop at some particular line. But now the troops are far over the line. It is humiliating for Ukrainians because we expect that the government will be able to resolve it and we don’t want to lose more and more cities and towns or lives. But you are accepting that the territory that has already been lost is lost to the government in Kiev? What we see right now is the growing popularity of the school of thought that we don’t want to kill these people, what ever they say about Ukraine and Kiev, it doesn’t mean we have to kill these people. We believe that they have to clear their minds after the propaganda that they have heard and we can live with them and live next to each other. Preferably in one state as we used to do. If they cannot live with us, let’s find some formula that will allow us to coexist. Your president, Petro Poroshenko, has said that Ukraine will always be a unitary state and will never be federalized but listening to you, you take a different line? I’m not taking a different line but we are talking about decentralisation and reality on the ground. We’re talking about Crimea which was taken by Russia in a sort of referendum and we understand the realities as they are. We don’t want to close the lines. We want to try to engage these people and provide them with everything possible at this particular time. We’re giving them gas and electricity free of charge to heat their houses in the region. We not expecting be paid right now but we want to help them live through this winter. So you are accepting that Crimea is gone? Crimea has been annexed by Russia and is now part of their territory? I am not recognising it as Ukrainian people. What I’m talking about is what we call a temporarily occupied territory. It is a phrase to describe it. That is what we have read now. There are legal differences between us and Russia. Russia believes it is a designated region of Russia and we believe it was annexed unlawfully by them and that one day it will be returned to Ukraine. What is interesting is that in this recent deal, negotiated in Minsk, the second one, a couple of weeks ago, Crimea was not even mentioned. We’re not talking about Crimea. We were talking about everything and what we’re trying to resolve immediately is how to stop bloodshed in the east of Ukraine. I heard criticism, that I would not refer to it as the Minsk to point out-- 2.0. It was a continuation of what was signed in September. It was just determining how to resolve it. It is not a new referendum on Minsk. Is this a recognition that really, what Russia wants, Russia will get because they are a bigger country than you and they are more powerful with their military? This thought is very popular in Europe right now and we hate to observe it. I will tell you that if we recognised this, we would not be fighting. We do not believe Russia can do whatever they want and we believe there are values and principles that need to be observed and respected and we believe there is a chance that Russia will understand that and behave like they’re in the 21st-century. The British Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond has said that Ukraine cannot beat the Russian army and that it is not a practical solution and there must be a political one. Angela Merkel said she could not imagine any situation in which improved equipment for the Ukrainian Army will lead to President Putin being so impressed that he will lose militarily. We don’t believe we will have to fight the whole Russian army. We’re not going to go and invade Moscow. We are trying to protect our lands from everyone who is here, these irregularforces from Russia. We are fighting with limited forces and we believe that, with some assistance from the West, we can deal with this threat as well. You have been asking for military help from the West, haven’t you? It is true. If you ask me whether we received it, no, not yet but we’re still in negotiations and that nations should understand that what we’re trying to do, we’re not trying to cross any borders or go into any borders or go into anyone’s land but trying to protect what is ours and we believe it can be done. We believe that with help from England and the United States and Canada and Europe, it can be done. What sort of help are you asking for and negotiating for? We are asking about what specialists would call defensive weaponry. I can give you an example. It could be drones or intelligence or assistance to find out who is shooting access our people and our cities. You know majority that the moment President Putin thinks weapons are coming in, he could dramatically escalate things in a very dangerous way? I believe that is what he is secretly and quietly indicating to everyone in Europe. That it could happen and the situation will be escalated that I have to tell you, after the terrorist acts we have seen in Ukraine, the situation is already quite escalated. We do not see that the situation will be any better without weapons from the West. Do you think you’ll get them? Do you think America will give you some military help? I believe that it is possible and it should be done. If we do respect the values and principles of all. If you are helping in Iraq, fighting against ISIS, why can’t you help Ukraine protect their nation? But you know that there are the likes of certain Ukrainian MPs, one of whom wrote on Facebook that the trouble in Debaltseve, which we have seen is that we have enough men and material, he says, but the leadership and co-ordination of action was missing and the competent action of troops was missing even though it is time to be covered up with propaganda? I believe to extent that we are very different society from what you see Russia. They would not be able to criticize their leaders the way we do. Even though they are fighting and their sons are dying, they will be telling their people that that is what they do because the great leader is telling them to. We have differences of opinions and some people are not happy with the leadership and believe that some battles were lost because of that leadership. The leadership can be changed. The principle is still there. We would like to have a peaceful nation and never secede more territory to Russia and we believe our deal with the European Union is no threat for Russia. Russia was our biggest trade partner. But we are still willing to clock rate when we finish with war. We believe we can heal our psychological wounds -- co-operate. Do believe the military leadership was wrong in the way they handled it? I am was wrong in the way they handled it? Iam no it? I am no expert so it is difficult to tell. What I know is that after each and every ceasefire, we lost land because we believed that the ceasefire would be used to heal the wounded and to withdraw the weapons. Unfortunately the forces of the separatists were moving to targets where our troops were and they struck at the time they wanted. We could not retaliate because we were under the obligation which was signed in Minsk. Do you understand and have some sympathy with the argument that come he actually, Russia saw what Ukraine was doing his provocation? Here is a former Soviet state that is talking aboutjoining Nato. Can you see why it would think, not in my backyard? ~ I have to tell you that Russia is also a member of a military pact. Everybody around Ukraine is in a different military block. We are not going to stay neutral because what we see now is a result of those policies. You will know that the former president of Georgia, who is now advising your president, he makes the point that this is actually about a battle for Vladimir Putin against the West, rather than for some territories in the Ukraine. And that is because he feels menaced hy And that is because he feels menaced by what the West is doing in Ukraine. I would expect him to do some thing. So far, we have only had Russian bases in Sevastopol and that is how things ended in Premier. I understand what he is saying because the former president of Georgia went through a very painful experience, fighting against Russia, and two pieces of their land were taken. I understand but at the same time, we are not provoking him. He might see it as a battle against the West but if I could recommend, I would see it as an opportunity for him. Because Russia would rather come close to the EU bunfight. If the Russian economy is doing poorly, the Ukrainian economy... He says the challenge is for Ukraine to become a reformed and non- corrupt society. That is where this new government in Kiev has failed. the total corruption of Ukraine. I mean, ideally, next day the defeat of corruption in Ukraine. Ukraine is one of the largest territories in Europe. And it has a large population. Ido realise how difficult this is. How painful and slowly this process is going. At the same time, we have all the potential that we needed to become a successful nation. We have our neighbours like Poland, who have shown how to transition from the Soviet system into the free market and liberal society. But you will know that there has not, so far, been a single prosecution of a senior official as a result of corruption. There was an opinion poll of Ukrainian people, which showed that almost half of Ukrainians now think that a third revolution is likely because of their dissatisfaction with the government. People are not happy, thatis government. People are not happy, that is for sure. They are unhappy because of many things and corruption is one of them. They are struggling through very difficult economic problems, they are struggling with the war, they are receiving the dead bodies of their close relatives and their friends... I understand that their frustration is great. But at the same time, we are doing everything that we can and the best thing we haveis that we can and the best thing we have is our unity. We know what should be done and we are listening to the advice from the EU about how it can be done. With some effort and sacrifice, I believe we can do what we are trying to do. You say that you are trying to do it in your own department. You are finding it hard? It is. It is very difficult to reform any bureau of foreign affairs. Because you are trying to get rid of corruption, corruption that you know exists but you cannot deal with? that you know exists but you cannot dealwith? I’m deal with? I’m lucky in that we are working in an environment that is more or less clear of corruption in foreign affairs. There are other areas like taxation and banking which are prone to corruption and it is very difficult to offer it at there. The police and everything. And these reforms are under way. I would like to see the much faster. I agree with you completely. We don’t have much time to spare. Has the government being distracted by the war in the east of the country? -- been distracted? It is distracted. We are losing notjust men but money. It costs 95 million of our currency. Everyday. This money is critically needed in Ukraine to reform itself and survive. That is why we put our hopes and requests to the West to get this money for us to survive this year, so we can reform and get back on track and get on with developing. What do you think Vladimir Putin’s ultimate ambitions are? There will be plenty of people warning what he would do next with regard the Baltic states. I know. I have been asked quite often what he thinks. When I was at the negotiations in Minsk, I did see him, and that was in my mind as well, what is this guy thinking? At the time, we were talking about Ukraine. I believe that he is becoming extremely sensitive and feels personally towards what is going on in Ukraine and I don’t believe that even his inner circle understands to be full complexity what he is trying to achieve and he might not even have this clear in his own mind. He has taken up on opportunities and I don’t know what his next death will be but I believe the sanctions are working. -- I don’t know what his next step will be . You will know that the government in Kiev has been accused, as have Russia, of using cluster bombs and Grav rockets in this fight. Human Rights Watch say that they have evidence that both sides have used cluster bombs. Can you commit to not using that kind of weaponry? I’m a diplomat. I’m not military. What I can tell you is that I have never seen anything that would allow Ukrainian forces to use any kind of weapon like this. And I expect that Ukrainian society will not stand for it if they find it is true. We have done cover many things, overturn many stones. We have to understand the catastrophe of MH17 and who is responsible. We are expecting it and we would like to show to be whole world is that what we are doing is right, that we are protecting ourselves and our nation. We believe it is not too late to stop right now. You will know that, to explain to people, these are munitions that contain bomblets. They cover an area as large as a football pitch and I don’t necessarily explode when they land, and as a result, they act like landmines. And Ukraine is one of the few countries in the world that has not signed up to a treaty that bans them. If you say you cannot see a reason why they should be used, can you say that Ukraine would or should sign up to that treaty? Ukraine is -- the same treaty. Ukraine has signed the not. I’m not in a position to discuss because I’m not military. I’m surprised at what you are saying, that we are not part of it. And Human Rights Watch says Ukraine is using these munitions in areas. Can you... Can you consider any area CBT! yOU... CBT! yOU COI’ISidâT any BTEB OT Can you... Can you consider any area or situation where that would be acceptable? No, not me. Iwould not expect and I do not see any situation where these weapons could be used. I have seen the reports from the Ukrainian media about the new weapons which were used against Ukrainian soldiers. The remains of these weapons were found. These are weapons that we don’t have. Even smaller pieces hitting the big areas. We don’t have the sort of weapons full of and this sort of weapons, believe me, you can buy in local store. Can you see a future where Ukraine has control again of its eastern border as it was before? I do see this future. What we have to do is show the better picture, the better life for these people. We have to let them go and see what the world is about. We have this fear that -- figure that only 4% of people have gone further to the west than Ukrainian soil. If they see in reality, notjust on Russian television, but what the world is like, what democracy is, what we are all trying to achieve, I believe it is very much possible that we will reunite. And there have been examples of nations that have reunited after many, many years. Thank you for coming onto the programme. Thank you. A pretty wild and windy night for the some parts of the UK.

Hello you’re watching BBC World News. I’m Nuala McGovern. Our top story this hour. Avoiding an apocalyptic scenario - President Putin dismisses the idea of war with Ukraine. In an television interview the Russian leader stands by the Minsk peace deal- but there’s still no sign that the full terms of the agreement are being implemented on either side. Welcome to the programme. on how migrant workers in Qatar are forced to live as they build the grounds for the 2022 World Cup. Evidence that eating peanut products as a baby could dramatically reduce the risk of developing an allergy to nuts. I’m Sally Bu ndock. In business, cutting it fine - Greece promises its list of economic reforms will be in the EU’s hands this morning. And what are the consequences of the huge fall in oil prices over the last six months? We take a look at Nigeria with a special report from Port Harcourt. But first, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has dismissed any likelihood of a war with Ukraine, describing it as an apocalyptic scenario. Speaking on Russian television, Mr Putin denied that Russian troops were involved in the conflict but he stressed his support for the recent Minsk ceasefire deal as the best way to stabilise eastern Ukraine. It’s still not clear when both sides will start pulling back their heavy artillery - one of the terms of the agreement. Lucas de jong’s report begins in the eastern Ukrainian town of Debaltseve The Minsk agreement was ignored by rebels here as they fought on and captured this strategic town, Debaltseve, last week. TRANSLATION: There will be no peace. This is my personal opinion. I would like to hang thisjoint in Kiev in the Parliament for the suffering they brought to this land. In his first interview since the agreement was brokered, Vladimir Putin was asked if the wore with Ukraine was possible. -- a war. TRANSLATION: I think such an apocalyptic scenario is unlikely. I hope it will never happen. The Minsk agreements have not only been worked out by the countries, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany, they have been fixed to the resolution of the United Nations Security Council. It has been supported by practically the whole of international society. It is already a completely different story. I hope this will be fulfilled. This is the right path towards normalisation. Back on the ground, fresh claims from the Ukrainian military that threaten to destabilise the situation further. Kiev has a -- accused rebels of filing rockets at civilians in south-east Ukraine. It says it will not pull back its heavy weapons until the shelling stops. For the handful of locals who have not fled the area and chosen to remain, they watch as their lives struggle. This will and says, we do not work anywhere, because there is nothing to eat. The fruit and work are drying up. -- food. For many, the Minsk agreement is as unstable as ever. Ajudge in Indonesia has rejected the appeal of two Australian men due to be executed. He condemned the two who were convicted of importing heroin. Migrants working in Qatar on building projects associated with the 2022 World Cup are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions - and being prevented from leaving. The BBC has filmed undercover with the workers who had been promised reforms after international outrage at the high numbers of deaths and poor conditions. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan reports from Qatar, where football leaders gather on Tuesday to try to settle on a final date for the tournament. Doha is rising from the desert, the vast Khalifa Stadium, the flagship venue of the 2022 World Cup. One of the biggest construction projects in history, and all Here standards are high, but there is wider concern that on sites across the city Qatar has failed to act on worker deaths and its controversial kafala system, in which employers effectively own labourers and their ability to leave the country. These are the sprawling labour camps outside Doha. journalists are not allowed in here, but some of our team made it to three sites where many workers live 15 to a room and have to put up with conditions like these. Here, in one of the richest nations of the world. Talking to us anonymously they said there has been no improvement. TRANSLATION: I cannot leave Doha or buy my ticket back home, because I do not have my passport and I need an exit visa. TRANSLATION: I have been here 14 years and nothing has changed. Many get sick from working in the summer heat. There are barely any safety measures on the construction sites. A year ago FIFA pushed for reforms but the critics say they are still waiting. We have seen no change, the kafala system is still in place. It is a system of slavery in the 21st century, and it must change. Here, a few kilometres outside the centre of Doha is what will be an entire new city being built in order to host the World Cup finals. The 1.4 million migrant workers on vast construction projects like this one have received plenty of promises. The big question now is if Qatar has the appetite for real change. Qatar 2022 say World Cup projects like new stadia have adopted higher safety standards and universal rights are on the way. Wages will be paid electronically to cut corruption. The government would not comment, but those advising it urge patience. I think there are some areas where there is no doubt that workers are working in slave-like conditions. Yes, it is slow progress. We have to be patient, but it is ongoing and there is quite a momentum. Back at the labour camps, a kickabout for those building Qatar’s World Cup dream. Ahead of the most controversial sports event ever, their struggle for rights continues. In other news Israeli intelligence did not share Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s view that Iran was a year away from making a nuclear bomb, a leaked cable suggests. In 2012, Mr Netanyahu said Iran needed to be stopped, telling the UN the country could build a weapon next year. The House of Lords will vote today on historic legislation which would see the UK allow creation of IVF babies using DNA from three different people. If the law is passed, it would make the UK the first country in the world to practise this method of conception. The controversial procedure could help to prevent serious inherited mitochondrial diseases. MPs in the Commons voted to legalise the practice earlier this month. Black rats have always been blamed for the spread of euphonic plate. But now scientists sayjuggles may have been responsible. They found outbreaks in Europe were linked to periods of warm and wet weather, conditions in which the population of gerbils and the fleas living on them breathe. Sally is taking a look at the deadline that was facing Greece with their reforms. The deadline came and went- Greece was expected to submit a list of acceptable measures to the EU on Monday, in exchange for a 4 month extension of its financial bail-out. Instead the governing Syriza party published a summary of the proposals late on Monday to avoid leaks in the press and has promised its EU creditors they will have the proposals this morning. So this is what we know. The Greek government is proposing to create a fairer tax system...This will include measures to combat tax evasion. A clampdown on corruption. Intensified actions against fuel and tobacco smugglers. It’s also proposing labour reforms on collective contracts and bargaining agreements. And actions against Greece’s humanitarian crisis with housing guarantees and free medical care for the uninsured unemployed. All these measures were widely expected. But is it enough? The list must be approved by international creditors today to secure a critical four-month loan extension. The fall in the price of oil, which has halved since its peak last year, is hitting oil producing nations hard. All of today we’ll be exploring the impact of the price falls - starting with Nigeria, Africa’s largest producer of oil, where the currency has dropped 20% against the dollar. Foreign currency reserves have been drawn down, the stock market has fallen and the central bank’s efforts to raise interest rates aren’t working. In WBR we’ll have a special report from Port Harcourt, in the country’s troubled Niger delta and find out what the fall in price means A new study has shown that eating peanut products early in life can prevent young children from becoming allergic to them. The trial involved more than 600 babies who were at high risk of developing peanut allergy and international allergy specialists have described the results as striking and compelling. just 3% of the group who eat regular peanut snacks developed an allergy. We can speak to one professor in London, the principal investigator of the study. He jointly from Houston in Texas. -- joins me. A lot of people will be reading this and feeling like they have to rethink everything they thought previously. That is correct to a certain extent in that for several decades we felt that avoiding an apology -- allergic producing substance would be the best way to avoid allergies. It looks like early exposure in the first year of life is very important to acquire tolerance and prevent the development of allergies. And they go back step further? What about pregnant women? Does that make any difference? That is not seem to be the main driving or contributing factor. We have looked at that in other studies. What seems to be the key is whether the infant consumes peanutin key is whether the infant consumes peanut in the first year of life, especially the first six months. So many products we get, it says, parents should not feed children peanuts. Will you be able to change the mindset with this study? I think it isjust a the mindset with this study? I think it is just a matter of a cultural shift. Because of concerns that emerged several decades ago about babies choking on peanuts. That is all peanuts. And concerns about peanut consumption causing peanut allergy. And of course the difficulty of having a peanut allergy. We have developed a somewhat peanut fearful culture. There will have to be a shift. The study findings indicate rather clearly that exposing very young children to peanuts, especially higher risk children, will protect them against developing peanut allergy. Thank you for that update. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: It’s the Cuban cigar festival and with the current thaw in relations with America, the country’s tobacco industry is hoping its fortunes are on the up. Now a look at some of the UK news. British police officers are in Turkey searching for three schoolgirls from London. It’s thought the girls are heading to Syria in order tojoin the group known as Islamic State. The Turkish government has criticised the British authorities for taking too long to inform it that the three girls were travelling through its territory. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the Conservative MP in the cash for access row is facing more pressure to step down as chair of Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee. Sir Malcolm, secretly filmed apparently offering his services to a company, says no Commons rules were broken. Labour’s jack Straw has defended himself against similar allegations. The UK offshore oil and gas industry has reported its worst annual performance for four decades, according to the industry body Oil & Gas UK. Falling oil prices and rising costs meant the sector spent and invested £5.3 billion more than it earned from sales during 2014. That outflow of cash is the biggest since the 1970s, when there was large scale investment in the flow of oil. This is BBC World News. I’m Nuala McGovern. The latest headlines: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has dismissed the possibility of a war with Ukraine, describing it as an apocalyptic scenario and stressed his support for the 2-week old peace deal. A BBC investigation has found migrant workers employed on World Cup projects in Qatar still living in squalid conditions despite promised improvements. The recent drop in oil prices has is having a dramatic impact on economies across the globe. Throughout the day, the BBC will take a look at how different countries are affected. The east of the Mediterranean has not been associated with energy resources until recently, when seismic surveys suggested that Israel, Cyprus, and Lebanon have large reserves of oil and gas. While Israel and Cyprus have been moving to capitalise on this, Lebanon has been lagging behind. Carine Torbey reports from Beirut. In catch them fish. What lies beneath our oil and between Cyprus, Israel, and Lebanon. Generous estimates for Lebanon are what probably attracted large companies such as the French Total and the American, Chevron. They quickly discovered that they were approaching troubled waters. This beachin approaching troubled waters. This beach in Beirut is almost halfway along the eastern coastline which stretches across 225 kilometres from the south to the north. The area of the coast deep into the sea is likely to be divided into ten gas and oil blocks. The final decision on how to divide these blocks and the terms of their exploration by the companies is currently caught up in political squabbles. This has created endless delays and made some companies reluctant to take the plunge. In the meantime, Israel has started producing gas offshore. Cyprus is also making headway but officials here insist that Lebanon has not lost the battle yet. Lebanon has completed the seismic survey both 2-D and 3-D of the entire exclusive economic zone. That will save us lots of time on the expiration fees and bring us directly to the production. Two years ago, there was euphoria in Lebanon over the bonanza. Billboards on the streets, is that equality of life and an end to chronic debt. The moment that promise seems to be drifting further and further away. If you would like to compare the price of fuel in one country to another, you can look at this online. Amongst the teams struggling to make their mark in the cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand right now is South Africa, thrashed by India at the weekend. Cricket is still seen very much as a white sport in South Africa. There’s only one black-African player in the World Cup team, a generation after the end of racial apartheid. As our Africa correspondent Andrew Harding reports, despite much talk about transformation of the game, change is coming very slowly. It takes a special stubborn devotion to play cricket here. Like so much of rural South Africa, this is and has always been football country. Al people do like cricket. -- how are people do not like cricket. Like people think it is the way people spot. They do not like it. They prefer to watch soccer and cricket. Even the World Cup, they prefer to sleep. -- black people think it is a white people sport. This man is trying to change all that. Cricket fanatic, it is ten years since he started his club at the local school. The community has come on board. Government support has been more of a challenge. Funding has been our struggle. Proper equipment, we do not have a cricket field, we do not have transport to make sure that we can fulfil our matches. The transfer costs. The potential is enormous. As with so many other things in South Africa, there is growing frustration about the slow pace of transformation, of change. Professional league match in johannesburg, black players are making real inroads here, in part, some would say, because there is a quota system in place. Five nonwhites are required in every team. The national squad, playing at the World Cup in Australia, still has any one black African. It is quite difficult to expect players to come through to play at this level if the facilities are poor. I believe that it is quite important that if we get the pace right, in the next three or four years, it will sort itself out. In terms of talent, we have talent. Backin Back in the village, a new batch of under 11 ‘s Back in the village, a new batch of under11 ‘s are being Back in the village, a new batch of under 11 ‘s are being looted gently away from football. I think that people can play any sport. just follow your heart. Even if you want to play football, you can play football. If you want to play cricket, you can play cricket. If you want to play rugby, you can play rugby. This is a free country. Free for certain. But when it comes to cricket, this is not yet a land of equal opportunities. Cigar enthusiasts from around 80 countries have gathered in the Cuban capital, Havana, for the country’s annual cigar festival. It comes amid new rules granting US visitors to Cuba permission to buy up to $100 worth of cigars, previously banned under Washington’s economic embargo on the communist island. The directors of some of the main cigar brands in Cuba are hopeful that improved ties will bring renewed investment and support for the country’s cigar industry. From Havana, Will Grant reports. Every year, this is the highlight of the true cigar aficionado’s calendar. Industry insiders around the world gather in Cuba to sample some of the country’s most iconic export. Whether the visitors are here just to make contacts, to order tobacco products and humidors, or simply soak up the atmosphere, this is one of the communist island’s premier trade events. This year, there is a key difference. Americans, previously banned from bringing them back into the US under the trade embargo, are now allowed to bring $100 of cigar products back in their luggage. It is the first time that we have been able to legally purchase them. Some of us who have been here before had purchased underground. This is the first time that we can do it and we are very happy. The company behind the Cuban brand is a joint-venture with the government. They hope that the US economic embargo will be lifted as part of the current forum between nations, something that they say would be a major boost for the tobacco industry in the country. TRANSLATION: Ourfuture market share to reach in the US is 70%. It is clear that we will reach this in the long-term. While improved cigar sales are important for Cuba, the real matter of the thaw takes place on Friday when the Obama administration hosts a second round of talks with the Cuban government in Washington. They hope to set out a timetable to reopen their embassies in each other’s capitals. Whatever the diplomats announced this week, for Americans, now able to smoke given cigars in Cuba itself, the door to the island has already reopened. The old saying goes, ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."" So when life gives you oranges, how about throwing them violently at your neighbours? That’s the way things go in Mexico anyway. These pictures are from a War of the Oranges festival in a town in the centre of the country. The event marks the beginning of the sowing season and has been held for 150 years. It’s supposed to ensure good rain and a strong harvest. But it looks pretty violent to me. Apparently everyone shakes hands at the end and makes amends. Showers continue through the night and into the first part of Tuesday morning, particularly across northern and western areas. Sleet and snow, too, especially over the hills and across the lower parts of Scotland. A very windy night, reaching 60 mph for the first part of the day. And those are the temperatures as we start the day, too - low enough for some ice in eastern areas. A story of sunshine and showers but the balance more in favour of the sunshine and fewer showers compared with Monday. A few showers here and there for the Midlands, Northern England and Wales. Still wintry over the hills. And where you have clear skies overnight, some ice on the pavements to start with. A good scattering of showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland to begin with. Snow mainly across the hills initially. That will change later during the day. The snow will return to lower levels as the temperatures drop again. It will feel cold, with the blustery wind adding to the windchill. Elsewhere, fewer showers, a better chance of staying dry through the bulk of the day at least. And while temperatures are not particularly high, the wind will still make it feel even colder than that. Into Tuesday night, light frost will form across eastern areas. Then we start getting air coming in from the Atlantic, and weather fronts increasing temperatures across western areas. Damp with rain on and off all day. Eastern areas begin dry and bright with some frost around, initially. Some will stay dry and bright through the day, but elsewhere, cloud will increase. In the west, showers on and off and extensive fog over the hills. But temperatures return to something a little bit milder. Weather fronts around, lots of cloud and a strengthening breeze. It turns very wet through the night in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Early rain across England and Wales easing through the afternoon. The sunshine does come out for many on Thursday but after a mild start, the temperatures drop and it’s back to sunshine and feeling cold again. This is BBC World News, the headlines. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said a war between his country and Ukraine is unlikely. Speaking on Russian television, Mr Putin stressed his support for the peace deal in eastern Ukraine, which was negotiated in Minsk. A BBC investigation has found that migrants working on building projects in Qatar associated with the 2022 World Cup are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions and being prevented from leaving the country by regulations. New research suggests that, contrary to accepted health advice, allowing young children to eat peanuts can help them avoid a peanut allergy. The researchers said the findings suggested new health guidelines were needed. Leaked documents published by the Guardian newspaper suggest a claim by Israel’s Prime Minister in 2012 that Iran was only a year away from having the ability to make nuclear weapons was not supported by his own intelligence service. Those are the latest headlines from BBC World News. Now for the latest financial news with Sally Bundock and World Business Report. Cutting it fine - Greece promises its list of economic reforms will be in the EU’s hands this morning. And what are the consequences of the huge fall in oil prices over the last six months? We take a look at Nigeria with a special report from Port Harcourt. Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Sally Bu ndock. Also in the program - the world’s largest miner sees its profits cut in half- Rico Hizon has the details. The deadline came and went- Greece was expected to submit a list of acceptable measures to the EU on Monday, in exchange for a 4-month extension of its financial bail-out. Instead the governing Syriza party published a summary of the proposals late on Monday to avoid leaks in the press and has promised its EU creditors they will have the proposals this morning. So this is what we know. The Greek government is proposing to create a fairer tax system. This will include measures to combat tax evasion. A clampdown on corruption. Intensified actions against fuel and tobacco smugglersIt’s also proposing labour reforms on collective contracts and bargaining agreements. And actions against Greece’s humanitarian crisis with housing guarantees and free medical care for the uninsured unemployed. All these measures were widely expected. But is it enough? The list must be approved by international creditors today to secure a critical four-month loan extension. joining me now from Brussels is Pieter Cleppe from the think tank Open Europe. Thank you for your time. To start with, you have been reading the various summaries in the press of what is likely to be in these proposals. What do you think of them? It is very unclear. If it is only limited to that, I would expect the institutions would ultimately accept them and national parliament in the Eurozone will accept them. But there were some rumours that Greece may be planning to increase the minimum wage. That could be a red line for the euro group. We cannot actually save whether we will see a rubberstamping of the extension of the loans. Initially you would think that is what is likely. Greece had to send the proposals I dislike. They did not. -- by midnight. One diplomat claimed this was because the partners of Greece did not agree with some of the things that Greece was suggesting. I think it is still in the negotiating stage. So much political capital has been spent. I am surprised if the deal would not be made. For the next four months, there will be some calm. But the whole thing might start again. It is likely to start again. So we are just kicking the can down the road, with tougher talks later? Absolutely. This going to pay up to 7 million -- 7 billion euros back. They want the negotiations before that. We appreciate your thoughts on that. Of course, we will discuss this further, it is all over the press. Global mining giant BHP Billiton has seen its first-half net profit almost halved to US $4.26 billion, on the back of collapsing commodity prices. It also reiterated a plan to spin off non-core assets. Let’s go to Rico Hizon in our Asia Business Hub in Singapore who has been following the story. BHP Billiton is not in the oil business, but it is all related. That is right. just like other mining companies. The profits were impacted by the falling prices of iron ore, coal, copperand impacted by the falling prices of iron ore, coal, copper and other commodities. Their profits falling hy commodities. Their profits falling by 31%. That was better than industry analysts were expecting. That is why the stock price is rising in late trade by 2.5%. To compensate for these falling prices, BHP has made deep cuts in its spending on exploration. They are prepared for a sustained period of lower prices by increasing their focus on efficiency. Capital spending is also down. Also, you mentioned non-core business. BHP is planning to move its aluminium and manganese business to a separate TTIBTIQBTIESE iJUSiT1âSS to S SâpST8tâ COTT’IpST1y manganese business to a separate company which will have nickel and Silvermines. Thank you. Good to see them. The fall in the price of oil, which has halved since its peak last year, is hitting oil producing nations hard. All of today we’ll be exploring the impact of the price falls - starting with Nigeria, Africa’s largest producer of oil, where the currency has dropped 20% against the dollar. Foreign currency reserves have been drawn down, the stock market has fallen and the central bank’s efforts to raise interest rates aren’t working. Lerato Mbele travelled to Port Harcourt, in the country’s troubled Niger delta - to find out what the fall in price means for those on the ground. In this thicket of Bush, swampland and rivers, lies Nigeria’s richest asset, oil. After 50 years of production, companies are looking further into the ocean to find more. Shell was recently embroiled in a $50 million settlement after local communities accused it of destroying the environment. Now, its most pressing concern is the volatile price of oil. The world is suffering from significant reduction in the price. It is almost part and parcel of the way we plan. We do not think it will stay forever. International companies are more concerned about the sector. Locals have been urged to buy oil stakes. This is one such company. It is already feeling the pressure. We have partnerships that were dependent on the high price of oil. The prices have gone below. It means we have a longer time than we thought on these investments. The government is calling for austerity measures and reduced spending and higher taxes on luxury goods. Ordinary Nigerians consist that living in an oil-rich country in an oil-rich city, cheap petrol should be their birthright. The president, they need to reach to the masses. The youths are all over the streets because there are nojobs. Experts say the postponement of the elections has added to the country’s problems. There may be a clear focus on how to manage the economy. I then, clear focus on how to manage the economy. Ithen, the economy. I then, the oil press may have recovered and Nigeria’s oil sector could be getting its way out of choppy waters. Let us show you the markets. It is responding to Greece, and a lot of attention on the Federal reserve chair. She will start testimony to Congress. See you soon. Significant government investment in bionic limbs means that people using bionic hands may soon be able to feel different temperatures. Scientists at the University of Newcastle are using microchips as fine as human hair which they say will take them Sharon Barbour reports from Newcastle The government today announced it was investing more than £5 million into three bionic engineering projects across the UK. In Newcastle, scientists are working on giving bionic hands the sense of touch. With the nervous system, the fibres take different information about temperature, about force and they can be identified. The information and sensation is that of temperature. The scientists involved in this new bionic research hope their work will help not only those born without limbs or undergoing amputations, but also patients who survive stroke automatic brain injury. There is nothing to save why we could not use these technologies to enhance the functionality or who are going into difficult situations like rescue services. So you are talking about making robots? Yes. The researchers hope to see their work within humans within five years. There is new research suggesting that allowing babies to eat peanuts can help them avoid a peanut allergy. The study showed an 80% reduction in peanut allergies among children who ate them from infant with. -- infant hood. Coming up at six o’clock on Breakfast - they’ll have all The headlines we are looking at: A BBC investigation has found that migrants working in Qatar on V Putin denied that Russian troops were involved in the conflict. I believe that such an upper galactic scenario is hardly possible. I hope thatit scenario is hardly possible. I hope that it would never come to this. -- apocalyptic scenario. Regarding the return of some territories. These are of an advantage as nature. It is not about returning territories to someone. A BBC investigation has found that migrants working in Qatar on building projects associated with the 2022 World Cup are still living in unsafe and filthy conditions and being prevented from leaving. The Qatari authorities had promised reforms after international outrage at the high numbers of deaths and poor conditions. Leaked documents published by the Guardian newspaper in London suggest that a claim by Israel’s Prime Minister in 2012 that Iran was probably only a year away from being able to make nuclear weapons wasn’t supported by his own intelligence service. The document is said to be one of hundreds of intelligence files from a number of countries that the Al-jazeera TV station has shared with the Guardian. Now it is time for our newspaper review. What’s making headlines around the world? We start with the 5-yearjail term given to blogger and pro-democracy activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah in Egypt for violating a protest law. The Wall Street journal carries a photo of his supporters reacting to the sentence. In the Financial Times, HSBC’s chief executive faces questions over the tax-evasion scandal at the company’s Swiss private bank. Stuart Gulliver claims bankers are subject to higher standards than bishops. The paper also has the drop in oil prices, with some members of OPEC, that’s a group of oil producing countries, considering calling an emergency meeting if the crude price continues to slide. In the International New York Times, Kenyan officials are incensed the country’s coastal tourism is taking a big hit. The officials partly blame western travel warnings, for what’s ‘hardly a raging war zone,' as they put it. Can you afford a Bentley car? If you can’t, buy the cologne, skis, or furniture instead. The paper’s business section reports that luxury car brands are selling more thanjust vehicles, to build customer loyalty. ""I fear being out of work"" - that from the Oscars’ man of the moment Eddy Redmayne, who won Best Actor. This photo is in the Daily Telegraph. I’m sure that he will not be struggling for work at the moment. joining us is Ravi Mattu. He’s the technology editor at the Financial Times. We had the Financial Times in some of the papers there. We will look at those stories. We go to the first one there. Egypt has sentenced the activist to five years in prison. That is Alaa Abd El- Fattah. activist to five years in prison. That is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. He was considered an icon of the revolution hy considered an icon of the revolution by some. What is very interesting to me about this particular case is that he was an icon, a secular figure. An that a lot of the cases up until now seem to have been the Muslims rather good. The case of a journalist from Aljazeera and the latter two of whom are still only released on bail. This court case looms over them. That issue is interesting. He is also the novelist of -- nephew interesting. He is also the novelist of-- nephew of a interesting. He is also the novelist of -- nephew of a novelist. of-- nephew of a novelist. The novelist and says that the conditions about freedom and democracy are worth and they have been for years. They have talked about the fact that they reduce his sentence. The earlier sentence was 15 years. It has been reduced to five years. Still, it is a front page of the Wall Street journal. Still, it is a front page of the Wall Streetjournal. We Wall Street journal. We are talking about it. The international attention in terms of how it is going about bringing about democracy. -- the international attention is on Egypt- international attention is on Egypt. There is a kind of Cold War playing out here. Nearby countries like Libya have become as her spots of anarchy. A lot of countries are struggling with dealing with that. Egypt is a major power in the region. They may be wanting some more stability there. Want to mention with the journalists that you mentioned that, they had a retrial which is scheduled for February 23. It is postponed until March eighth. People will continue to watch those reports. Some stories in the National Times. Stuart Gulliver had a tough time yesterday. The bank released the annual results. The Guardian is saying that he was leaking information about his personal management of his money. He had to face the barrage of questions. He had said that they have to be whiter than white as CEOs of banks. It is interesting for two reasons. He talked about being held to a higher standard and bishops. One of his predecessors is an ordained minister. With is awkward. The truth is that banks have been in the headlines since the to him. -- financial crisis. This is the world we live in. You just need to get on without. What about his point when he says, you know, can I know what everyone in my organisation is doing? It isjust not reasonable to be across everybody’s behaviour. At the same time, when you are the boss, you are the boss. That is part of being the boss. You take the hits. There is a broader narrative of accountability. Everybody wants a person to personify wrongdoing or blame. That is part of the back draft. In fairness, there was the situation in terms of helping clients with their tax affairs that some people had disagreed with. He says that is a source shame for the bank. Are they held to a high standard? I’m not sure. In democratic systems, you have a government... Question about whether the regulators were doing theirjob anyway. That is another matter. You cannot vote out a CEo in the same way that you can government. Moving up a page in the Financial Times. This is going to be covered across the BBC. The drop in oil prices. Here we have the president calling for an emergency meeting if that oil price falls further. She is Nigerian, one of the country is Nigerian, one of the country can credibly affected by these changes in oil prices. Precisely. Countries like Nigeria, Venezuela, and Russia are especially affected, and Iran as well. Gulf Country, Saudi Arabia, they are less affected economically. The challenge for them is that their economies are dependent on oil and the finances are more precarious. How do they manage that? Countries like those in particular, it is going to be very hard. She is saying thatif going to be very hard. She is saying that if the trend continues, OPEC might have to have an emergency meeting. They had won in November and it didn’t achieve much. Saudi Arabia and those not so affected stood their ground the pressure. Exactly. In the story, my colleague mentioned that Saudi Arabia may not agree to this. They are the biggest country in the block. For them, it is not as big an issue. We look at Kenya. An interesting article about tourism is sagging on the coast of Kenya. The danger is that we are remembering that massive event from a year ago, the shopping centre under siege. Those events do impact terrorism. This is an interesting story. They buried the key point further down. Some American officials one was quoted off the record said that it was a self-defeating policyjoblessness and lack of activity among the young men leave them to go astray, to terrorist organisation such as al-Shabaab. But depriving those areas government, getting the balance correct with these issues is Something lighter. What is your favourite car brand? -- sell to Western tourists. I personally wouldn’t. It does point to this bigger issue. When it comes to luxury brands, they are notjust a product. They are a lifestyle. All of these ancillaries products are about selling the ideal that you belong to a unique club. If you can buy the polisher or the skis, or the watch, good on you. (CROSSTALK). You are part of an elite club now. just wait until the sponsorship opportunities come your way. He says that he is very happy but worried about being out of work. He will be OK. Eddie Redmayne did a great speech on the stage of the other night. I think that he will turn out OK. There are some OK. There are some paper headlines from yesterday. Some of the stories being followed up from yesterday. Some brand-new ones. Ravi Mattu, thank you. The technology editor in the Financial Times. Thank you as wealthy company. Have a very lovely day. -- as well for your company. Showers continue through the night and into the first part of Tuesday morning, particularly across northern and western areas.

The competition will be shorter but will severely disrupt European leagues. The Premier League’s Richard Scudamore says he’s disappointed by the recommendation. Fifa keep all of their international dates, Fifa keep their World Cup in tact. Even Uefa, who I think have let us down a little bit, have clearly pushed this to late December so their Champions League can start and carry on, just like it always does. It’s the European leagues and the European clubs that are going to suffer the most. So it’s very disappointing. We’ll ask what this means for players and fans.

On this afternoon’s BBC London: Should this woodland be cleared to create more burial space for the people of Southwark? Many locals think not. And there’s a full weather forecast to come too. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. For the first time in its history, it looks likely that the Football World Cup will be played in the winter. A Fifa task force has recommended the 2022 Qatar World Cup be moved from the summer, and cut in duration, to protect players from the fierce heat. But it’s a decision which will cause massive disruption to the British and European football leagues. At the last World Cup, 75% of players were from European clubs. After today’s meeting in Doha, the head of the Premier League, Richard Scudamore, said he was ""very disappointed"". From there, our sports correspondent, Richard Conway, sent this report. Qatar is busy getting ready. Preparations to host the World Cup have turned it into a hive of activity that buzzes around the clock. With summer temperatures regularly exceeding Ao degrees, football officials decided games had to move to the cooler months of winter. After months of discussion, today a recommendation was finally made. It is clear that are pros and cons for all. There will not be one solution which will be supported by all. There is one solution which is coming out from the discussions which is November-December. The Fifa World Cup is Qatar’s. Qatar shocked the world when it won the right to stage one of the world’s biggest sporting events. With 75% of the players in Brazil drawn from European teams, there is strong opposition to a switch given that Qatar bid and won on the basis of a summer tournament. They will face disruption to fixtures. Very disappointed. On behalf of all of the European leagues and particularly European clubs who provide most of the players. The idea we have turned up today and it is a pretty short meeting to be told it will happen in November -December, very disappointing. Qatar 2022 will be the first World Cup in the Middle East, the first in an Islamic country. Its supporters feel the world’s most popular game must break popular ground and be held in fresh territories. For a country determined to deliver amazing, achieving a compromise solution was crucial. Our plans in terms of infrastructure and operations have been going on since day one. This is another milestone that we have crossed. We can continue focusing on delivering an amazing World Cup. Qatar is free to continue with its frenetic building efforts, safe in the knowledge that this World Cup is heading to wintertime. Richard is in Doha. Was this a surprise or was it ultimately inevitable? Fifa’s had Sepp Blatter talks about football being like a family but it feels like football is having a family feud. It was a long time coming this decision. It has been drip fed that perhaps this was the only option. january-February had been raised as a possible compromise. But there was the Winter Olympics then which will be held in Kazakhstan or China and no appetite for a fight with the International Olympic Committee. Subject to a rubber stamp Olympic Committee. Subject to a rubberstamp in rubber stamp in Zurich next month, it will be held in November and December. For Fifa, it eliminates one of the problems. For the Qataris, they have said they would be prepared to host it in any time of the year, talking about cooling technologies. But critics said, you cannot air condition and entire country. It will now move, it seems, to the winter months. For the clubs and leagues, they are disappointed and there is anger from them. and leagues, they are disappointed and there is angerfrom them. It will have to ramble on and there will have to be some sense of agreement between them and perhaps an issue of compensation for the disruption it will cause, that may now rumble on. Qatar will face more scrutiny on migrant workers’ now rumble on. Qatar will face more scrutiny on migrant workers’ rights and other issues. After this meeting, Qatar can look forward to welcoming the world to Qatar in winter in seven years from now. And Andy Swiss is outside the Etihad Stadium where Manchester City are playing Barcelona this evening. We have heard from Richard Scudamore but what are the big clubs like Man City making of this? We have Manchester City playing Barcelona tonight, two of the biggest clubs in Europe. This will have implications across Europe. For the Premier League match for the first time ever, there will have to be a winter break. First-- so many of their players... We are going straight to Westminster. Sir Malcolm Rifkind has just emerged. I mentioned in my statement that I did not want the work of the committee to be distracted by the controversy regarding my position. I attach a great deal of importance to the work of the committee. It is quite obvious that had become an issue. The committee ceases to exist in four weeks’ The committee ceases to exist in four weeks’ time so we are talking about a very short period. Do you think you did anything wrong? No. I might have made errors ofjudgement. We all do. We are human beings. On the substance of the issues that Channel 1+ and the Daily Telegraph produced, Ido not think the allegations are justified. Was produced, Ido not think the allegations arejustified. Was it your decision or were you pushed by Downing Street? No, Downing Street do not have that power. You were under no pressure? If you would let me answer yourfirst under no pressure? If you would let me answer your first question. The intelligence committee acts under Parliament. The Prime Minister has no power to dismiss members of the committee. I reflected on the situation last night and I could see theissue situation last night and I could see the issue was obviously an issue which was arousing public interest. I did not want the work of the committee to be distracted. At the very beginning when we met at 10am, I read a statement which is the statement we issued to the press and then we did the main business. Were you the author of your own misfortune in the sense some of your comments yesterday clearly upset and angered many of your colleagues, particularly the suggestion you were entitled to a higher standard of living because of your professional background? Entitled might not have been the right word. Each person determines on the work they do the kind of living standard you aspire to. As long as it is within the law, that is very sensible. Why are you standing down? I put out a statement explaining that. The people of Kensington... The Kensington Conservatives have been supportive. I took the decision to stand down because there is major uncertainty because I do not any longer have the Conservative whip, it might be reversed when the party committee has completed its work, but we do not know. Therefore, I do not want to but we do not know. Therefore, I do not wa nt to leave not want to leave my colleagues in the Conservative Association in Kensington suddenly finding with an election around the corner that they have to find a new candidate. Thanks very much indeed. There we have it. Sir Malcolm Rifkind setting out the reasons why he is standing down. Not accepting any blame or any faults. Saying he is standing down because he does not want to damage the committee and distract from its work. A very different tone to that of yesterday when Sir Malcolm was defiant, frankly. I suspect this morning he probably put his finger UP morning he probably put his finger up to see which way the political wind was blowing and read the newspapers and had the unhappiness of many fellow MPs and will have seen the lack of support from Downing Street and he will have realised, I think, Downing Street and he will have realised, Ithink, that realised, I think, that his position had become untenable. Many thanks. Ourassistant had become untenable. Many thanks. Our assistant political editor in the scrum outside the intelligence committee. The news that Sir Malcolm Rifkind has stepped down as an MP and he has resigned as the head of the committee. A man has pleaded guilty to assaulting and attempting to rob a vulnerable pensioner last month. Alan Barnes, from Gateshead, suffers from various disabilities and the attack on him led to an online appeal that raised more than £300,000. Today, Richard Gatiss pleaded guilty to assault. Danny Savage reports from Newcastle Crown Court. Hello. It was one of the most heart-warming images of the year so far. The young woman meeting for the first time with the man she had raised money for after he was mugged. The online appeal for Alan Barnes went viral and global. It had to be shut down after the original target of £500 was exceeded somewhat. £330,000 was raised for him injust a few somewhat. £330,000 was raised for him in just a few days by people disgusted by the attack on the vulnerable 67-year-old. I am not upset but... It is magic, really. I did not expect anything. He was left with a broken collarbone after being pushed over outside his home in Gateshead as he put out his pen. -- rubbish bin. To date Richard Gatiss pleaded guilty to assaulting and trying to rob Alan Barnes. Richard Gatiss is shocked and deeply ashamed of what he did, the court heard. At an earlier hearing, he worked in the dock as the court was told his DNA linked into the attack. Alan Barnes has a number of disabilities because his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant. He now plans to buy a home near the woman who raise the money for him and use some of the money on their by community projects. -- of the money on their by community projects. -- nearby community projects. Scotland Yard has denied it took three days to inform Turkey about three missing schoolgirls who travelled from London to possibly join Islamic State in Syria. Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, who is 16, travelled to Istanbul a week ago. Turkey’s deputy prime minister said officials would have taken ""necessary measures"" had they known earlier. The new Greek government has proposed a series of reforms which it hopes will win it a four-month extension to its EU bailout deal. The agreement is due to run out on Saturday and without a new one, the Greek government risks running out of money and possibly having to leave the eurozone. Let’s cross to Athens and our correspondent, Mark Lowen. Thank you. It was the long-awaited manifesto for the new Greek government. A 6 page document outlining reforms it hopes will persuade the eurozone to ease austerity while extending the loan. It is comprehensive, ambitious, but will it please all sides? A month since the election, Greeks are finding out how their country will change. The government has sent proposals to Brussels offering some compromises. In Athens today, wariness, but hope too. TRANSLATION: The government has considered a lot of things but I did not think they would get everything they asked for. It is impossible. Whatever they achieve is good. If he does not do the majority of the things he said before the election, yes, he will lose support. I don’t believe it will change. I think everything has been written or been signed a long time ago and it must be followed and all of this is a big... There are three areas. Tax evasion, long a scourge year, coupled to raise funds. Social spending will help the poorest receive health care and food. The public sector will be made more efficient, streamlining where possible. This is the first big test for the Prime Minister. Satisfying Greece’s creditors while keeping his voters on board. He made big promises before the election. Across Greece, his support is high, but on the hard left of his party, the cracks are beginning to show. The veteran MEP has hit out apologising to voters that his party had renege on policies for now, the critics are few, but the splits could grow. For the new government, a tough challenge. To push through reforms, help victims of austerity, but still keep Greece in the euro. A conference call is due in the next few minutes. A clash and the deal could collapse. The mood music from Brussels appears relaxed now but implementing the reforms and selling them to the voters, will be harder. Thank you very much. Our top story this lunchtime.

For anyone filling up the car, or heating the home, the fall in the price of oil in recent months has been good news. But it’s not been so welcome for the industry, which has seen North Sea revenues fall to levels last seen in the 1990s. Now the UK oil and gas sector is warning that thousands ofjobs will be at risk, if the government doesn’t do more to help it. Here’s our Industry Correspondent, john Moylan. The North Sea. For Ao years it has provided Britain with oil and gas and supported thousands of well-paid jobs and delivered billions in taxes to the Treasury. But the fitted by falling oil prices and rising costs, the industry has delivered it leakers assessment of its future. Last year, North Sea revenues fell to the lowest level since the 1990s. Firms scaled back exploration. IA wells were drills, the lowest since the 1960s. Investment could collapse to £2.5 billion in three years. Our fear is we see investment falling away rapidly. The high costs and indeed high taxes mean it is difficult to secure new investment in the North Sea. Last year, the oil price began to tumble and kept on going. It has since recovered slightly, but it was down as much as 55% at its worst. Behind the collapse is surging oil production, boosted why fracking in the United States. The man has been falling, due to economic woes in places like China and Europe. But there is a huge upside to lower energy costs. For millions of motorists, filling UP For millions of motorists, filling up a tank of fuel is costing ten, £11 less than it was in the middle of last year. It amounts to a lot of cash that can be spent elsewhere, potentially boosting the economy. It has boosted this firm in Wrexham. It is in the plastics business and oil is a key raw material. The good news for the industry and the economy is prices will settle out but figures will be less than they were in 2011+, which will enable us to sustain increases. Today the Chancellor described oil and gas as a national asset and the government had a plan to back it. Changes to the North Sea tax regime in the forthcoming budget may be inevitable, but will it be too little, too late? And if you want to check how global oil prices compare to the price of petrol where you live, you can find a fuel price calculator on our website. That’s at bbc.co.uk/news. The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett said she is embarrassed over a radio interview in which she failed to cancer a question. We are looking at 2.7 billion. Are they made of plywood? Each £1 spent brings back £2 1+0. What is the total cost of 500,000 new homes? About 60,000 is per home. Our Political Correspondent, Eleanor Garnier, is at Westminster. Eleanor what else did she have to say? It was difficult to listen to. Even Natalie Bennett herself said it was excruciating. She hasjust been Natalie Bennett herself said it was excruciating. She has just been on the daily politics rogue ramp where she apologised to Green party members that she had had a brain freeze. All the attention is on this interview, this car crash interview. But today was the Green party’s campaign launch and that is where they wanted the attention to be focused. I was at a campaign launch when Natalie Bennett talked about holding a fairer economy, she touched on the NHS and housing and said it would be the Green party’s biggest and boldest campaign with candidates standing in 90% of constituencies up and down England and Wales. The thing about these party campaign launches, they want to generate positive headlines. But I suspect, the public, the voters and also the Green party themselves will not be remembering to date for the campaign launch, instead I think they will be remembering it for that car crash interview. Thank you. In eastern Ukraine, Russia-backed rebels say they have begun to withdraw some of their heavy weapons from the front line, as demanded by the conditions of the Minsk ceasefire. Overnight, though, heavy shelling was reported from around the rebel stronghold of Donetsk and our World Affairs correspondent Paul Adams is there. This is the road out of Don yet scared. It is about 20 kilometres that way. These guns, we are told have come from the airport area and will be driven further away to a storage point, according to the terms of the Minsk agreement that was signed more than ten days ago. My understanding from the OSCE is they do not have information on what weapons will be moved. What routes they will be moved along and crucially where they will be stored. What we are being told is all of that information will be made available to the OSCE, so they can verify this process is real. For now, all we can say for certain is we are seeing guns on the move, but we cannot be certain where they are going to end up. The parents of a missing 16 year old have appealed for their daughter to get in touch. Rebecca Watts was last seen at her home in Bristol on Thursday. Today her family have made an emotional appeal for her to come home. jon Kay reports. Becky Watts, at home in Bristol before she disappeared. The 16-year-old is described by her family as quiet and shy. She is a typical teenage girl. Music, fashion. Herfatherand stepmother fashion. Her father and stepmother told fashion. Herfatherand stepmother told me today her disappearance is out of character and they are desperate to the news. If you can see this, get in contact. If anyone out there knows something, just tell us, bring her home safe. If you’ve got her, but her somewhere where we can find her. Please! She is not in trouble. She isjust wanted here. We just want her back. That is all we want. It is five days since she left her home in the St George area of Bristol with just her home in the St George area of Bristol withjust her Bristol with just her laptop and a phone. Police say nobody has heard from her since then. Friends, family who expect to have regular contact with, we have had no contact will stop we are concerned about her well-being. Police have searched open ground close to her home, but said there have been no significant breakthroughs. Five days on, detect it is and her family are mystified by her sudden disappearance.

For years it was thought that the way to deal with it was to keep them away from nuts. But now researchers say that giving babies as young as four months old peanut butter or peanut snacks could result in a dramatic reduction in the number of children who become allergic. Our health correspondent, jane Dreaper, explains why. You carry this around in a back pack. Eight-year-old Sophia has to keep his emergency treatment with her at all times keep his emergency treatment with herat alltimes in her at all times in case of an allergic reaction. As a baby she was allergic to soya, milk and eggs. Archie is able eat peanuts safely after taking part in research. If I happens, then I would have more allergies. And I would still not be this good. Sophia was in a carefully run trial involving more than 600 babies at high risk of peanut allergy. In the group who avoided peanut Roddicks completely, 17% were allergic to them by the age of five, butjust 3% irrigate regular allergic to them by the age of five, but just 3% irrigate regular peanut snacks, developed an allergy. This ground-breaking research shows ground- breaking research shows eating ground-breaking research shows eating peanut products early on can prevent an allergy. The trials were done here at this Children’s Hospital in south London. Babies were given small amounts of this special peanut snack. Now we are saying, you actually have two actively intervene and introduce the peanut allergen early on, the peanut protein early on in the first 11 months of life. No young child should ever be given peanuts because of the risk of choking. Current guidelines say children with allergies need medical advice before eating peanut snacks. This research could make a big difference to the lives of many more children like Sophia. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today: Fifa says it wants to move 2022 World Cup to the winter months. The Premier League has said it is hugely disappointed. In a moment, Peter Gibbs will be here with a full national weather forecast and we’ll have the news where you are. But first with news of a whirlwind double century at the cricket world cup, and all the rest of the day’s sport, here’sjessica Creighton at the BBC Sports Centre. We st West Indies batsmen, Chris Gayle has scored the first double century in the cricket World Cup. He set his side on course for a 73 victory over Zimbabwe. But too long, West Indies cricket has been waiting for its day in the sun. Chris Gayle, often seen as the bad boy, today, a rebel with a cause. After losing his opening partner without scoring, he was lucky to be given a second chance. That was about as much of a warning he needed. A special innings began to take shape. He breezed his way to a century and for most batsmen that would be the pinnacle. Today, for Chris Gayle, it was just the start. It was at times brutal. Along with Marlon Samuels it was becoming the highest ever one-day partnership. Records notjust being broken, smashed. Another mighty swing of the bat and he became the first batsmen ever to reach 200 at a World Cup. Marlon Samuels reached 133. But this was all about Chris Gayle. Even the beleaguered Zimbabweans were quick to congratulate him. They did put up a bit of a fight with the bat, but Chris now did the damage the bat. Controversial striker Luis Suarez returns to England tonight as his Barcelona side take on Manchester City in the first leg of the last 16 in the Champions League. Barca beat City 1+-1 on aggregate at the same stage last season. Ben Croucher looks ahead to the match. Deja vu, the same might be French, the challenge Spanish. Last year Barcelona knocked Manchester City out of the Champions League. Fast forward 12 months, fate has thrown them together for a rematch. We want to beat Barcelona because we want to go as far as possible, not because of revenge. We are more experienced in the competition. We had difficulties in the group stage. just going to be a matter of winning the game. Not revenge. City’s Champions League record is not pretty. Twice knocked out of the group stages, the only previous time they made the last 16, Barcelona proved too strong. We know they have a lot of quality players. They are showing they are one of the best teams in the world in the Premier League. I hope, not this year, but next year, they will be fighting for this petition. Last year, City were fighting for four trophies. In 2015, they are out of both cup competitions. It could be to their advantage. We want to try to win as soon as we can the Champions League. Every year, trying to improve what we do in domestic games and also Champions League. It is the next step for the club. To be the best, you have to beat the best. With Messi and Luis Suarez returning, tests like Barcelona seldom come tougher. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. We heard about England struggling to make their mark, one of the tournament favourites, South Africa, were thrashed by India at the weekend. Cricket is still seen as a white sport in South Africa. There is only one black player in the team. A generation after the end of apartheid. As our correspondent reports, despite much talk about transformation, change is coming very slowly. It takes a special stubborn devotion to play cricket here. Like so much of rural South Africa, this is, has always been, football country. People do not like cricket. It is difficult because black people think it is a white people’s sport. They do not like it. They prefer to watch soccer than cricket, even in the World Cup. They prefer to sleep. You dropped the catch. But this man is trying to change that. A cricket fanatic, ten years since he started this club at a local primary school. The community has since come on board. It had government support -- government support has been more of a challenge. Funding has always been a struggle. Getting proper equipment. We do not have transport, cricket field. They have failed us. The potential here is enormous. As with so many other things in South Africa now, there is growing frustration about the slow pace of transformation, of change. A professional league match in johannesburg. Black players are making real inroads here. A quota system is in place. At least five non-whites are required in every team. The national squad still has only one black African. It is quite difficult to expect players to come through to play for this level if the facilities are poor. I believe it is quite important that if we’d get the basics right, in the next three orfour years, get the basics right, in the next three or four years, the top will sort itself out. In terms of talent, we have got talent. Back here, a new batch of under 11s are being gently lured away from football. I think people can play any sports. just follow your heart, even if you want to play football, you can play football. If you want to play cricket, you can play cricket. If you want to play rugby, you can play rugby. This is a free country. Free for sure, but when it comes to cricket, this is not yet a land of equal opportunities. Now a look at the weather. ~ I have had enough of this chilliness. The weather cannot make up its mind. Is it winter or spring? Day in, day out, it goes on. Tantalising hints of spring but nothing more. Today we have still got the chill, brisk winds coming in from the West or Northwest. Snow across northern hills. Further south, much of England and Wales, one or two light showers, at many places missing them. Temperatures similar to yesterday but feeling colder in the breeze. A little bit of snow across the Pennines and Southern uplands. Rain showers across Northern Ireland. A rumble of thunder possible. Snow falling across the Scottish mountains further north. Sunshine in between. Cold in the wind. It will be cold overnight across Scotland and North East England. A touch of frost. A bit of fleeting snow over the Pennines. And across the South West of Scotland later in the night. For most, cloud and rain and temperatures rising as the night goes on. Risk of frost in northern areas. A lot more cloud tomorrow. That is the main story. Some dry and bright weather. For the north-east of Scotland particularly. More rain pushing in and turning to snow on the Scottish mountains. Further south and east, the better chance of staying dry. Signs of the milder air pushing in. Double figures in Northern Ireland and Wales and the South of England. That is ahead of this warm weather front. Temperatures overnight on Wednesday into Thursday could be higher than Wednesday into Thursday could be higherthan in the Wednesday into Thursday could be higher than in the daytime. Touching double figures. Here comes the cold front. That means it is the leading-edge of colder air. A band of heavy rain on Thursday. A chill in the air particularly in northern areas. Perhaps snow showers once again in Scotland and perhaps Northern Ireland. Friday, another bright and breezy day, particularly blustery for a time. The weekend, the changeable theme keeps going. The timing of the low pressure might change. The theme is there for windy weather, rain at times. Not really anything firm in the way of spring. Now a reminder of our top story this lunchtime: Fifa says it wants to move the World Cup in cat aunt to the winter. Malcolm Rifkind is to stand down as an MP and as chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee following allegations of cash for access. I do following allegations of cash for access. Ido not think I did anything wrong. I may have made errors ofjudgement. We all do. We are human beings. On the substance of the issues, no, Ido are human beings. On the substance of the issues, no, I do not of the issues, no, Ido not think the allegations are justified. That is all from us here on BBC One. Now it is time for the news where you are. Good afternoon. I’m Asad Ahmad. Thousands of people have signed a petition against plans to create extra graveyards in Southwark. It’s because the expansion of Camberwell Old Cemetery would include clearing woodland which some residents want to preserve. But the council argues that because burial space is running out so quickly, it needs to act now. jim Wheble reports. It isa It is a cherished place that time has forgotten the centre of a busy London borough. Lots of finger pointing at this public meeting by residents concerned the woodland could be changed drastically. Like the rest of London, there is virtually no nowhere left to bury the dead and the council feel... Over the last decade, we have lurched from one crisis to another, almost running out of space. We agreed a strategy which we thought and belief still would provide us with something like 20 years of burial space. with something like 20 years of burialspace. Orthe with something like 20 years of burial space. Or the people of the borough. There is an expectation that precious green spaces should be protected for people to enjoy. A couple of years ago, a campaign stop these playing fields being turned into graves. Even though that is what the land was always meant for. At the public meeting, the council stressed the plans are as much about good woodland management as they are about new burial plots. But Blanche Cameron who has been walking in the cemetery woods for years is seeing a different picture. What Southwark saysis different picture. What Southwark says is that it will be a managed woodland when everything is finished but unfortunately the chances are, looking at their plans, that all of these trees here, the saplings, the new growth, it will go. There will be a few trees left and the rest will be row upon row of mass graves. That is what we will be left with, with a few pepper potted trees around. Nearly 3000 people have signed a petition against the plans. The council are thing out of room to provide solutions. -- the council are running out of room. Sun rays shining through a glass jar have been found to have started a house fire in Twickenham that killed a family’s dog. London Fire Brigade says the jar of Nutella chocolate spread was being used to store loom bands in a child’s bedroom.

In the last half-hour, British counterterrorism police have confirmed they believe the girls are in Syria. It is understood they are on their way tojoin in Syria. It is understood they are on their way to join Islamic state militants. Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase travelled to Istanbul a week ago. Our security correspondent Gordon Corera’s been looking at whether more should have been done to prevent the girls leaving the country. ~ -- to prevent the girls reaching Syria. It is a week since they disappeared, and now the news feared by their families. We have been told they were taken into Syria four or five days ago by smuggler. It is thought their plan is tojoin days ago by smuggler. It is thought their plan is to join with the group calling itself Islamic State. Before the news, a blame game had begun. British police said they told Turkish authorities about the girls’ arrival within a day, Turkish authorities say it was longer. TRANSLATION: A country like Britain, famous for Scotland Yard, has not followed these three girls despite the concerns about them. We were informed three days after they came to Istanbul from Heathrow. So what could have stops them heading to Syria, and were warning signs missed? In December, a 15-year-old friend of the three, also a student at the Bethnal Green Academy, left for Syria. Police talk to the girls at school, but some clues were in their online activity. Shamima Begum had a Twitter account on which almost all of the dozens people she followed were sympathetic to the group calling itself Islamic State. This included the accounts of a British woman, a known recruiter for other women. She is one of those who provides advice for others on how to get to Syria. On the 15th of February, Shamima Begum treated to a well- known Glasgow woman who had gone to Syria to marry a jihadist fighter, asking her to get in touch, although there is no sign contact was made. The three girls left for Turkey the next day. Could more have been done to monitor their social media? There were things that the girls were following that were known to be used by influential people in the Syrian conflict, and perhaps more could have been done to track those people online. Who is responsible? MI5 says it has to prioritise serious national security threats, Twitter says it can’t monitor all accounts, the girls’ school says they were not to blame, Turkish airlines say no rules were broken, the families say no... They did not know what no. .. They did not know what was happening. It seems everyone and no 1 was responsible. This is the news the families would have dreaded. What are the realistic chances of contacting these girls or persuading them to come home? It has just got a lot harder. The BBC understands that they crossed the border into Syria a few days ago, taken by people smugglers. The three were identified as British, one was wearing glasses. I think the great hope for the families was that they would be delayed in Turkey, which might give the authorities chance to find them. just today we heard about a couple of Dutch girls who had gone out on Friday and were intercepted in Turkey and centre back that day. Now the British girls have crossed into Syria, that possibility is gone. They are coming effectively, out of reach of the authorities. The families could still contact them, some families have gone out there to try to talk family members back, but thatis try to talk family members back, but that is very difficult and dangerous. The fate of these three girls now lies with the girls themselves, and whoever they are with. Thank you. The former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who’s been at the centre of cash for access allegations, is to stand down as an MP at the general election. He’s also resigned as chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. Sir Malcolm, who denies any wrongdoing, was secretly filmed discussing how he could obtain access to ambassadors on behalf of a fake Chinese company. Our political editor Nick Robinson reports. All political lights and in failure, someone once said. On the day after all his defiance before, Sir Malcolm Rifkind did his best to prove it. Emerging from a meeting of parliament’s intelligence committee, he quit as its chairman and announced he would quit as an MP at the next election. I reflected last night, I could see the issue was an issue which was arousing public interest, I did not want to distract from the work of the committee. Do you think you did anything wrong? No, but I may have made errors of judgment. Error ofjudgment judgment. Error of judgment one, boasting judgment. Error ofjudgment one, boasting to a Chinese businesswoman, who turned out to be an undercover reporter, about how little work he did as an MP and how much he could earn giving a speech. £5,000 to £8,000, something like that. You’d be surprised how much free time I have, I spend a lot of time reading and walking. The second error, not apologising. Are you sorry? I am angry that people make allegations that are unfounded and unjustified. I am not sorry, I am livid. And error ofjudgment number three, error of judgment number three, insisting he error ofjudgment number three, insisting he was entitled to a higher salary. I want to have the standard of living that my professional would normally entitle me to have. That claim that he was entitled to earn more dried up much of the sympathy for a man who may not actually have broken any rules. Do you think you are the author of your own misfortune, in that some of your comments yesterday clearly upset and angered many colleagues? The word entitled may not have been the right word. Why did a man who was fighting to save hisjob one day quits Why did a man who was fighting to save his job one day quits 24 save hisjob one day quits 24 hours later? The answer is simple, number ten threaten to push Sir Malcolm Rifkind if he did notjump first. Or, in the language they liked in the Tory party, they offered him a glass of whisky and a revolver and urged him to do the honourable thing. Almost 30 years ago, he was made Scottish Secretary by Margaret Thatcher. john Major made him first Defence Secretary and later Foreign Secretary. The experience made him an obvious choice to chair the parliamentary committee, which oversees the work of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. So why might Michael Rhett -- Malcolm Rifkind to think he was entitled to more? If he was still Foreign Secretary he would be on £134,000 a year, but owns half that as a backbench MP. For his work chairing the intelligence and Security committee, he owns nothing. But he took home more than three times his salary last year from sitting onjust three company boards. And that, claim some, does notjust benefit him. The Houses of Parliament needs to have people of the calibre to be Cabinet ministers. Almost without exception, they would otherwise in the light sub stands -- command very substantial salaries. Are we better off without MPs like Michael Rifkind -- Mark can Rifkind, who think they are entitled to earn A Fifa task force has made the unprecedented recommendation that the 2022 football World Cup should be held in November and December to avoid the sweltering summer temperatures in Qatar. If confirmed, it could cause massive disruption to the British and European football leagues and its broadcast partners. One Premier League chairman called the decision a disaster. Europe’s clubs may now seek compensation for the disruption caused. Our sports editor Dan Roan reports from the Qatari capital, Doha. You don’t normally get this in the run-up to Christmas, but in 2022 one of the world’s most iconic summer sports events will be staged slap bang in the middle of winter. Today, after years of controversy, the game’s most powerful figures gathered here in Doha, to thrash out a date for the Qatar World Cup. It was the news many in the sport had feared. There will be not one solution which will be supported by all. But there is one solution which is coming out from this discussion, which is November/December 2022. Fifa says the soaring summer temperatures here mean for the sake of fans and players, football’s showpiece event must be shifted from its traditional slot. But what will the fallout be from the Winter tournament? European leagues will be thrown into chaos, with a seven-week break at the height of the season. The World Cup itself will be shortened, to minimise the impact, and clubs and broadcasters may seek compensation for the disruption. On behalf of all European leagues, and particularly European clubs, who provide most of the players that this World Cup, the idea we have turned up today, it was a pretty short meeting, to be told it will happen in November/December is very disappointing. Ido not have an issue with the World Cup being here, but it should be played in April, May, june, july or August, in the conditions in their bid they said they could provide. COMMENTATOR: Fellaini on the back post! And afflicted by Mata. Seven years from now FA Cup replays like this one may be scrapped, as football makes room for Qatar 2022, but it may be at a blessing in disguise for the England team and their manager. If I was Roy Hodgson, I would be thinking, brilliant. We now have a chance of winning a major tournament, because for the first time ever, we have got the chance to go into a tournament with a fit, fresh team. Qatar is not known for its football, but for many here in Doha, like these fans at a local league match this week, today will feel like the build-up to the first World Cup in this region can finally begin. It offers people the opportunity to get to know the true Middle East, and at the same time offers the Middle East the opportunity to get to know the people on the outside andat is how you th bridge the gap. These are turbulent times for Fifa and this tiny Gulf state. The date of its World Cup is settled but the rancour could be set to continue for years. WE we had Phil Neville saying that this could be good, but clearly there are some disappointment among the British and European football leagues, so what kind of fight back can we expect? A considerable one. After all, let’s not forget that, in 2022, the World Cup final itself could take place just two days before Christmas. That’s why tonight to the Premier League, the all powerful top flight of English football, the biggest clubs in the land, came out fighting, threatening what they called action, potentially, over the decision. They say it threatens the cherished and traditional English best football programme. In breaking with decades worth of tradition, here in Doha today, Fifa has really brought more and more pressure on itself. It has compounded the controversy that has surrounded Qatar’s hosting, first because of allegations of corruption and then about the ways it treats migrant workers. Now this, the divisions in the game seeming wider than ever tonight, and once again questions are raised over Fifa’s fitness to run the game. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories: The UK is to send military personnel to Ukraine in the next few weeks to provide short-term advice and training. The Ministry of Defence says that up to 75 troops will go, divided into fourteams covering medical, logistics, intelligence and infantry skills. The London Stock market has ended the day’s trading on a record high. The 100 share index closed up 37 at 6,950 - surpassing its previous record set in 1999 at the height of the dotcom boom. There was an agreement by European finance ministers about a Greek request to a four-month extension of its bailout bid. The Parliaments in several EU member states must now vote on it. It’s supposed to be the day the Green Party lays out its main policies for the general election, but that’s been overshadowed by a radio interview given by the party leader Natalie Bennett earlier today. She appeared unable to answer basic questions about the party’s plans for social housing, and said she suffered an excruciating mind blank. Our political correspondent Vicki Young reports. We had all had them - the kind of days that start with high hopes and expectations but end up being once he would rather forget. ~ "" OFICE yOU -- once you would rather forget. For Natalie Bennett this was a chance to showcase the Green party’s best policies. This is going to be our biggest, boldest campaign ever. Politicians need to have facts at their fingertips, instead Ms Bennett had what she described as ""an excruciating mental brain fade"" as she struggled to explain the party’s policy on housing during a radio interview. What we are looking at, in terms of the figures here... What we need to do is actually... We are looking at a total spend of 2.7 billion. What is the total cost of 500,000 homes? Erm, a cost of £60,000 per home. How are you going to pay for the land? Right, well, what we are looking at doing is basically... COUGHING. Are you all right? Yes, as you can probably hear I have a huge cold. I am terribly sorry. Later she told me she had not done a good job of presenting the party’s policies. I did not do a greatjob this morning. I had a brain fade, that happens. What I am aiming to do is to face up to that and then move on. Natalie Bennett’s cold may explain today’s performance, but she has been under fire before for giving vague answers. How can you hope to raise 45 billion, when tried and tested wealth taxes raise peanuts compared to that? The Greens are enjoying a surge in popularity. You would expect a party leader to be across policy details. For those who have turned to the party in recent months looking for an alternative to the main parties, maybe they will not care too much about a couple of bad interviews. Our top story this evening: The three British schoolgirls have crossed Later on BBC London: The campaign against expanding a graveyard despite lack of burial space. Having their say - why Londoners’ feelings about living in The drop in the price of oil around the world has brought many benefits to consumers - cheaper prices for travel, food and other goods. But it’s having a negative effect in many countries who are dependent on oil revenue. From 2010 until the middle of last year, the cost of oil was about $100 a barrel. But since late june, it’s roughly halved, trading at between $50 to $60. In Russia, the cut in income, along with the impact of sanctions following the crisis in Ukraine, has left the country heading for recession, as our Economics Editor Robert Peston reports from Moscow The towering giants of Russia’s oil and gas industry, an indsutry that’s dominated the country’s economy and provided more than a decade of rising prosperity and improving public services. But, with a halving of the oil price, it’s all falling apart and needs a spot of renovation. Russia’s heading into a pretty severe recession. How bad do you think It’ll get? It depends on oil prices. If they are standing at $50 to $60 per barrel, as most analysts are now thinking, we are expecting recession by 3% to 4% this year. Here in this central Moscow market, it’s easy to see the pernicious impact on living standards of Russia’s tumbling currency which has forced up prices. Oh, my goodness, lovely mouth-watering produce. The problem is it’s becoming less and less affordable for Russian The collapse of the rouble means food price inflation is running at more than 20% a year. Russia tried to become a powerhouse of global capitalism and built this Moscow city as a rival to the City of London. Those ambitions have been put in the deep freeze partly by falling oil but also by sanctions imposed over Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. The building’s are not far off half empty and have some pretty unexpected te na nts. How is it you ended up opening a hostel in this extraordinary modern skyscraper? We went to see this propertyjust for laughs. With thought we couldn’t possibly afford this. A globally ambitious oligarch, Evgeny Lebedev, owner of London’s Evening Standard and the Independent newspaper along with his Russian assets. How serious are Russia’s economic problems? They are serious, there’s no doubt. Before it gets better it will get worse. These are the consequences you get from not having an independent Parliament, a proper election, at least bi-partisan system, independentjudiciary and free media, when you have a bureaucracy so overpowerful that the lack of any control regarding them makes the country completely inefficient. But the Kremlin and many Russians don’t see the economic woes as their own fault. They see the falling oil price and sanctions as economic warfare against them by America and the West. Russian people are poorer, they are less secure in theirjobs but, so far, most of them don’t appear to be blaming the Russian Government. Can President Putin count on their undying loyalty forever? It’s certainly going to be a very interesting year.

A man has pleaded guilty to assaulting and attempting to rob a vulnerable pensioner last month. Alan Barnes, from Gateshead, suffers from various disabilities, and the attack on him led to an online appeal that raised more than £300,000. Richard Gatiss, who’s 25, will be sentenced at a later date. Danny Savage reports from Newcastle Crown Court. This is the lounge, Alan. Nice radiators. Alan Barnes, the mugging victim overwhelmed by the kindness of strangers. Today, he was out househunting, looking to set up a new life with the money raised for him. I’ve never had a home of me own. I’ve always lived with parents or in a council house. This will probably be something very different. I’m quite looking forward to living where I want to live. Today, 25-year-old Richard Gatiss pleaded guilty to assaulting and trying to rob Mr Barnes. Newcastle Crown Court heard today that Gatiss is shocked, horrified and deeply ashamed of what he did. At an earlier court hearing, he wept in the dock as the court heard his DNA linked him to the attack. Mr Barnes was set upon outside his then home and left too scared to return. What followed was a heart-warming meeting with 21-year-old Katie Cutler who set up an online fund to help him. Her appeal for him went viral, going way beyond the original £500 target. Do you feel like a celebrity now or not? Well, I didn’t really know what a celebrity was, like. I suppose I must be one now, the way people are going on about it. As a result of a cruel attack, Alan Barnes now has a much brighter future restoring his and many other people’s faith in others. MI5 agents are appearing in a US court for the first time to give evidence in the trial of a man accused of plotting bomb attacks in Manchester and New York as part of an Al-Qaeda conspiracy. The agents, who are wearing wigs and make-up to hide their identities, are testifying in the trial of Abid Naseer who was extradited from the UK in 2013. Our New York Correspondent, Nick Bryant, has been in court and he joins us now. ies What more can you tell us about this alleged plot and what was said in court today? At that courthouse in Brooklyn, we’ve seen the sort of hair and in Brooklyn, we’ve seen the sort of hairand make-up you in Brooklyn, we’ve seen the sort of hair and make-up you associate with theatrical productions in Broadway so keen has MI5 been to conceal the identities of the witnesses in this case who are undercover sir vileance officers.

Britain’s biggest payday lender, Wonga, is to cut a third of its workforce. 325jobs are to go in London, Dublin, Cape Town and Tel Aviv. The cuts are part of changes that the company’s chairman says will see Wonga become smaller and less profitable. The remaining roles are expected to be based in London and Cape Town. Around one in 50 children in the UK has a peanut allergy. For years it was thought that the way to deal with it was to keep them away from nuts. But now researchers say that giving babies as young as four months old peanut butter or peanut snacks could result in a dramatic reduction in the number of children who become allergic. Eight-year-old Sophia’s diet is a balancing act. As a baby, she’s learningic to soya, milk and egg. Sophia can eat peanut products safely. She built up tolerance after she eight them in this research. I didn’t know what was going to happen. So Ijust tried them. Nothing happened. It was great, actually. We found out a lot of things we didn’t know. We didn’t know there were so many children with allergies. Peanut allergy affects as many as one in 50 schoolchildren in the UK. This trial involved over 600 babies like Sophia who were at high risk of becoming allergic to pea nuts the in the group who avoided peanuts completely, 17% were allergy to them by the time they were five years old. In contrast, just 3% of the group who ate regular peanut snacks developed an allergy. This ground-breaking research shows ground- breaking research shows eating ground-breaking research shows eating peanuts early on can prevent an allergy. The trials were done here at the Children’s Hospital in South London. Babies were given small amounts of this special peanut snack. We realise this goes very much contrary to previous advice but it is essential bidirect our attention to this group of infants and really stem this growing epidemic of peanut allergy. Medical advice is needed before any child with he will earningies tries peanut snacks and no young child should ever be given whole nuts because of the risk of choking. But today’s research could make a difference to the lives of many more children like Sophia. New the weather. This week the temperatures will yo-yo up and down. A change is on the way for tomorrow. Today’s been quite fresh. We’ve had lots of showers, quite windy conditions too. Tomorrow, cloud with some rain. That will be brought in by a warm front which I’ll show you on the satellite picture. This is the low pressure breaking up. This arc of cloud, slightly warmer air wafting in almost springlike conditions, at least for some of us as we heard towards the middle part of the week. You can see this warm air ready and waiting to come our way. Through tonight, still pretty chilly in the north of Scotland. Temperatures there below freezing. For the rest of us, increasing amounts of cloud. Rain carried in by that west to south-westerly wind. In Plymouth about 7 degrees in the morning. Still cold in the north-east of Scotland. Minus1 Still cold in the north-east of Scotland. Minus 1 for Aberdeen. Tomorrow, with the mild weather we’ll have to pay for it. It will be quite cloudy. Particularly in western areas. The east may get sunshine, East Anglia, London. 12 degrees in Plymouth, 11 degrees in London. Still on the fresh side in Scotland. After that, it will change once again. This rain will sweep some of that mild air away into the near continent for Thursday. By Thursday afternoon, rather than the air coming from here, it’s going to come in once again from the North Atlantic. Those temperatures will dip away. You get that feeling of things going up and down over the next few days. Friday looks set fair. Sunshine around. On the breezy side. A couple of showers. If you’re planning for the weekend, it doesn’t look too grate. A big low heading our way for Sunday. That spells rain, gales and fairly cold weather once again. A reminder of our top story this evening. The BBC learned the three missing British schoolgirls from East London have crossed from turkey into sir why. That’s it from the BBC News at 6.00pm. Tonight on BBC London News: A family loses everything including their pet dog in a house fire sparked by a glass jar. Also tonight: Sir Malcolm Rifkind resigns over cash-for-access allegations.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind has paid tribute to his Kensington constituents following his resignation as the borough’s MP. He announced his intention to resign after being caught up in the latest so-called ""cash for access"" scandal. The former foreign secretary says he decided to leave the commons to make sure a candidate could be found for his constituency. As our political editor Tim Donovan, reports. Save our shops! One of his early battles was fighting the congestion charge coming to Kensington and Chelsea. It’s a decade since Sir Malcolm Rifkind revived his parliamentary career, after eight years away. Selected for this, one of the safest and most desirable seats in the country. But there seemed, here, little surprise, today, that he had decided to quit after recent events. It’s a shame because he was a very good MP. I’m very sad that that has happened and, unfortunately, he’s done what he’s done, but I think he probably had to. I think it’s a great pity. He’s a very bright chap. He should have spotted that they were undercoverjournalists, I would have thought. And do you think his comments to them were foolish, having raised questions about his future? Yes, definitely. So you think he should go? I think he probably should go, yes. He did it very quickly, as well, whether he was asked to go or whether he decided that he should go. He did the right thing, I think. No one was talking at his local association office today. Sir Malcolm had wanted to serve one more term and said he had not come under pressure, locally, to go. It was his instinct to end uncertainty. The people of Kensington and the Kensington Conservatives have been enormously supportive. No one has suggested that I should step down. I took the decision because there is major uncertainty, because I don’t any longer have the Conservative whip. That might be reversed in three weeks’ time when the party committee has competed its work. But we don’t know how that work is going to be completed and, therefore, I don’t want to be my colleagues in the Conservative Association in Kensington suddenly finding, with an election ran the corner, but they have to find a new candidate. That would be unfair. As a local MP, he didn’t have a reputation for making especially telling contributions on London issues, but that’s partly because representing such an affluent place, he didn’t have a particularly large or pressing constituency caseload. And, of course, because his parliamentary duties involved chairing Intelligence and Security Committee. Who now get their hands on this prize is the question. One bookmaker had former rowerjames Cracknell and former cricketer Andrew Strauss right up there. And one Borisjohnson an outside bet. Yes, even though he has already been selected for a seat.

The Conservatives are still yet to select in at least a couple of seats in London. What is unusual is that such a sort of prying plant-- prime and valuable seed should become available. So few weeks before the election. You can guarantee you will be looking at their CV ‘s, looking at their phone contacts and there will be a sense of excitement here. This will have to be a pretty truncated process. There will be nominations opened by the local association. A timetable will be decided after it is consulted. It will have to be done pretty quickly, I imagine. The local association will decide on a short -- a short list of I imagine three orfour -- a short list of I imagine three or four candidates. Probably in two or three weeks, I or four candidates. Probably in two orthree weeks, I imagine or three weeks, I imagine there will be a meeting of the Conservative Association in Kensington. The candidates will be invited to address the audience. They will take some questions and then a decision will be made. Thank you. Coming up later in the programme: Expand an existing cemetery or preserve woodland - the dilemma facing one south London council due to a shortage of burial space? A south west London family say they’ve lost all their possessions, including their pet dog, in a fire which seriously damaged their home. It’s believed that the blaze in Twickehham was started when sunlight hit a Nutella jar filled with loom bands, causing the rays to magnify onto window blinds. The Declan family of four were out at the time, but theirjack Russell, Chilli, was trapped inside. Katharine Carpenter is in Twickenham for us tonight. Well, this fire happened over one week ago. You can still smell the smoke in the air on the street. It is the cause of the blaze which has just been revealed, which has shocked everyone here. Some are calling it a freak accident. It is one which has left the family here absolutely devastated. The fire started up there. That is mY The fire started up there. That is my daughter’s bedroom. Returning to what is left, Declan still can’t believe what has happened. Or how quickly everything his family was destroyed. Utterly, utterly horrific. It’s life changing. We are stunned and none. -- number. We are speechless. Nothing can describe what goes through your head. It started in his daughter’s bedroom. She was keeping some rubber bands in a jar bedroom. She was keeping some rubber bands in ajar on bands in a jar on a windowsill. It’s refracted The Sun’s Reyes, setting fire to the blinds. It’sjust beggars belief. But London Fire Brigade ‘s says it has been called to 125 fires caused by The Sun’s raise in the last five years. yea rs. Certain years. Certain objects have the ability to focus The Sun’s raise. You can see thatit focus The Sun’s raise. You can see that it focuses the light onto a point. Pointed at a flammable objects, it has the potential to cause a fire. It happens on a far larger scale when this skyscraper melted cars in the city. Four days after the Murphy fire, lingerie entrepreneur Michelle Mcllveen claims that a mirror had set fire to a bean bag in her home. -- Michelle Mcllveen. You can’t have anything on your windowsill. I wouldn’t want this to happen to anyone else. He says he doesn’t feel unlucky, just thankful that his family was not at home when the fire started. Although, they are mourning the dog who could not be saved. The family have been told it is safe to go back into the house. They’re coming back later to clean out the fridge. They want to be able to live here for some 79 months. They’re staying in temporary accommodation. Seven to nine months. There are three-year-old keeps asking when he will be able to come home. Earlier, the Fire Brigades told me that they don’t want to scare anyone. It would ask householders to be vigilant. They say it is a reminder to make sure you have a smoke alarm fitted. Thank you. There’s still disbelief in some parts of London about how Scotland Yard officers are still hoping to find the East London teenagers and return them to Bethnal Green. Meanwhile, pupils in neighbouring schools have been telling us why some young Muslims are attracted to radical Islam. Here’s Alex Bushill. The disappearance of three schoolgirls bound for Syria has been felt across the capital. No more so than in our schools. These three girls are at this coUegein These three girls are at this college in Hackney, around the same age and born in London. How do they explain it? Your kind of saying -- explain it? Your kind of saying -- I don’t think he can save all the world’s problems. It’s saying I am going to go and do something. What can you do when you’re 15 years old? I literally shocked and kind of disappointed. They told me they knew a girl who attended a north London Mosque you are being driven to take upjihad. She felt like this place was not home for her. She used to wear a veil when she went out. People made silly comments about her faith. She had enough of this country. I think she was easily influenced by other people. This is a very -- people. This is a very -- there is a very simple question, as to why high achieving students would be seduced by one of the most oppressive regimes anywhere in the world. If you come here and ask of the many Muslim communities here, you will get a range of views. Sometimes differing and sometimes contradictory. There are those who blame social media sites like this. It promises adventure and romance. This woman who runs eight charity to combat radicalisation agrees. They’re promising that you will find the love of your life in Syria. He will marry and live happily ever after, helping vulnerable Muslims who are suffering. I’m sorry, but thatis who are suffering. I’m sorry, but that is not reality. Extremist ideology can appeal to men and women. One of the key issues is the ideological brides, which is encouraging women and men. It makes no difference what gender you are. -- ideological brides. The Chairman of the football-anti-racism group ‘Kick it Out’ has called on the police to 'swamp’ Wembley stadium on Sunday ahead of the League Cup Final between Chelsea and Tottenham. Lord Ouseley was speaking the week after London football fans were implicated in two separate incidents of racist and anti-Semitic behaviour on public transport We want to see all the authorities come together to be prepared for Sunday’s game at Wembley, to swamp the place with security and police, to root out those who are coming in looking for trouble, to be on those trains and to stop chanting, and to make sure that we are going to rid football of that element. Police say a memorial to a man who died in police custody poses a security risk and must be removed. Leon Briggs died at Luton police station in 2013. ~ -- he died in hospital. Outside Luton police station, an outpouring of grief and love for Lyon. Messages from his children, cards for Father’s day. -- love for at this father. He was held here in police custody before he died. The memorial has been here for more than a year but police now say it could be a security risk. They are considering removing it. I would be very surprised if there were no protests after words, if this memorial is moved. Last year, his best friend showed us where he was detained in Luton in November 2013. He was one of the most-- one of the most lovely people you could know. Police say he was detained under the Mental Health Act because of concerns about his behaviour. He was taken to the police station and transferred to hospital, where he died. For the past 15 months, his family and friends have been trying to find out exactly what happened. The police watchdog, the IPCC, is investigating five officers and a civilian member of staff under suspicion of offences, including manslaughter, gross negligence and misconduct. The IPCC reports and Leon’s inquests are both due in the next few months. The timing of this proposal is absolutely shocking. Bedfordshire Police did not want to be interviewed, but gave a statement saying that the proposal to remove the memorial came after a security review of all its premises. It won’t say why it’s thought this could be a security risk, but it says it is that it’s a family ‘s concerns and will discuss with them an alternative site another memorial. -- an alternative site another memorial. -- it is sensitive to concerns. Thousands of people have signed a petition against the expansion of a cemetery in south London. They say plans to create extra graveyards in ‘Camberwell Old Cemetery’ would mean clearing woodland which some residents want to preserve. But the council argues that burial spaceis But the council argues that burial space is running out so quickly in London, it needs to act now. jim Wheble has the story. It’s a cherished place that time has forgotten in the centre of a busy London borough. Hence lots of finger-pointing by residents at this public meeting, concerned that the woodland could be drastically changed. But, like the rest of London, there is virtually nowhere left to bury the dead in Southwark. The council feel they have to act. Over the last decade or so, we have lurched from one crisis to another in terms of almost running out of burial space. A couple of years ago, we agreed a strategy which we thought would - and still believe - will provide us with something like 20 years of burial space for the people of our borough. But there’s also an expectation that precious green spaces should be protected for people to enjoy. A couple of years ago, a resolute campaign stopped these playing fields being turned into graves, even though that’s what this land was always meant for. At the public meeting, the council stressed that the plans are as much about good woodland management as they are about new burial plots. But Blanche Campbell, who’s been walking in the old Camberwell Cemetery for years, is seeing a different picture. What Southwark says is that this will be a managed woodland when everything is finished, but, unfortunately, the chances are, looking at their plans, that all of these trees here - the saplings, all of this new growth, will go. The undergrowth will go, there will be a few trees left and the rest will be serried ranks, row upon row of mass graves. That’s what we’re going to be left with. With a few pepper-potted trees around it. Nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition against the plans. But the council are literally running out of room to provide solutions. Still to come, tonight: Sharing their feelings about living in the capital. Would you want your views on a billboard? And the weather is blowing hot and cold. I will keep you up-to-date. Next, their work allows us to imagine what it’s like to visualise space - amongst other things. And designers at the London-based company DoubleNegative are so good at it, they’ve just picked up an Oscar for Visual effects for the film Interstellar. In a moment we’ll speak to one of the co-founders. First our entertainments correspondent, Brenda Emmanus, on how a business started in London 17 years ago has dazzled the movie makers. And the Oscar goes to... Interstellar. It’s the film by one visionary director that led to an Academy Award for a London-based company. Interstellar, the ninth epic offering from Christopher Nolan, scooped visual effects firm DoubleNegative their second Oscar. While their colleagues prepare to return to the capital with the golden gong, those in their West End office reflected on the whole experience of making the movie. The great thing about Interstellar was that it was this beautiful, almost old-school amalgamation of the practical stuff that we did on set, the beautiful miniatures, and then taking all that and working with the computer. You don’t see that as much anymore. Generally, studios don’t like to put all their eggs in one basket. If you put your work in one facility, if something goes wrong, then you’re stuck. But Chris just wanted to work with us. We did the entire movie here. It’s a pretty extraordinary accomplishment. DoubleNegative’s first Oscar came with Christopher Nolan’s 2010 science-fiction thriller, Inception. Their latest project with the director stretched imaginations and fuelled creativity. And how awesome is this? We used these images to represent Saturn. On the big screen, this makes us feel so small. It’s such a lovelyjourney, to be able to depict this spaceship with humans going past Saturn. DoubleNegative have recently published two scientific papers with the world’s leading astrophysicist, Professor Kip Thorn. They have turned science-fiction into science fact, by creating the most accurate depiction of a black hole ever seen. Everybody is involved in this process, to make it as great as possible. And a good experience to everybody who works on it. On this movie, I think we have achieved something quite extraordinary. Well, the Academy agreed. So, with the addition of a television and animation devision, as well as new offices abroad, this London company looks set for world domination. And we talk to Paul Franklin one of the co-founders of the London-based company DoubleNegative - who’s still in LA after the Oscars at the weekend. Good evening. Are you still celebrating or recovering? Well, it took a while to recover. It was a big night after we got the award. We were out pretty late. I think I am just coming down off its now. Perhaps your HOW. PâI’i’I8pS yOUIâ COITIPB Fly now. Perhaps your company should be called double O. This isn’t the first time you have one. -- double negative -- first time you have one. -- double negative -- double Oscar. Yes, this is the second time we have been lucky enough. When you are not used to being in front of camera -- When you are not used to being in front of camera -- in front of the camera, what does it be like to go UP camera, what does it be like to go up on stage? -- what does it feel like. Is pretty terrifying. You don’t really want to write an acceptance speech because you think you might be magnifying your potential disappointment will stop on the other hand, it’s only 1+5 seconds. You cannotjust go up there and try to win it. It’s a little bit like doing a bungeejump. -- and try to win it. It’s a little bit like doing a bungeejump. -- trying to improvise. It is quite an accolade, isn’t it? Hollywood film makers look to London for creative skills. I think the UK has a fantastic history of film making, going back over 100 years. It’s one of the places that cinema was invented. We have amazing studios and amazing cruise. We have long had a very vibrant visual effects community. Working in television, advertising, and increasingly in film. Much has been said about British talent at the Oscars this year. Did it feel like a sort of British invasion? I have been lucky enough to be there twice before. This was the most Brits plastic Oscars I have been out. It felt great. -- Brits plastic Oscars I have been out. It felt great. -- full of British people. Show us the Oscar! There you go! It weighs about £10. Congratulations. Thank you for joining us from Los Angeles. We’ve all got views on what it’s like to live in the capital. But imagine if they were shared with the whole of London - in a big way. That’s exactly what a project by Central St Martin’s School of Art has done. Ayshea Bu ksh explains. London is great if you are young and rich. I am London is great if you are young and rich. Iam neither. rich. I am neither. just one of the comments displayed on this billboard in his London. It is part of a digital art projects, created to look at why people are leaving the capital. The idea came from former New Yorker and university lecturer, Rebecca Ross. She wanted the hopes and fears of ordinary Londoners to be better heard by policymakers. She set about asking people looking to relocate for their sports. Hundreds of people got in touch and some were chosen to feature on to digital screens. One in Whitechapel and the other elsewhere. These are usually reserved for corporate advertising. I was really excited about taking the voices of individuals and putting those voices at that money mental scale. This is by no means a scientific study, but many of the comments do reflect how difficult it is for people to live in London at the moment. Everyone we spoke to -- people to live in London at the moment. Everyone we spoke to -- not everyone we spoke to was so negative. In the shadow of the screens, we asked people for their thoughts. The opportunities are great here but I think it’s difficult to live here. A lot of people say they’re driving out of London. I am living two stops from Liverpool Street. I found a nice apartment there. I think it’s reasonable. I don’t get that bad. I think this is a great city. If you want to become something, this is the place to be. I love London. Every day, I walk over the Tower Bridge and I think it’s a great city. I have no plans to leave. While the cost of living may have tainted living in London, like many relationships, it seems that our love for the city can be both passionate and complex.

174,BBC1 London,24-feb-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten - the three missing schoolgirls from east London are now thought to be in Syria. The teenagers flew to Turkey a week ago, ignoring their families’ urgent appeals to return home. This is the crossing into Syria where the girls were apparently seen according to BBC sources. They’re likely to be heading for the city of Raqqa, a stronghold of Islamic State extremists. We’ll have the latest on the numbers of British women who’ve travelled to Syria in the past few years. Also tonight: Sir Malcolm Rifkind is to stand down as an MP following claims that he offered to trade his influence for cash. I don’t think I did anything wrong.

We’re looking at a total spend of £2.7 billion. And in tonight’s football, Luis Suarez returns to haunt Manchester City in the Champions’ League. On BBC London: A family loses everything, including their pet dog, in a house fire sparked by sunlight through a glass jar. And why researchers in the capital say feed babies peanut snacks to avoid allergies in later life. Good evening. Scotland Yard says it’s received information that three schoolgirls, who disappeared from east London last week, have made their way to Syria and it’s feared they’re already under the control of the extremist group Islamic State. Kadiza Sultana, who’s16, and Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, both 15, travelled to Turkey last week and local sources have told the BBC that they were taken into Syria four or five days ago. Our correspondent, james Reynolds, reports from Istanbul. Tonight, it seems clear that schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultan and Amira Abase have made it through Turkey and into Syria. Contacts tell the BBC that the three are with a smuggler affiliated to the so-called Islamic State. The three flew out of Gatwick a week ago during half-term. Amira told her father she was going to a wedding. Sources tell us that the three girls, and the smugglers, prepared for the crossing on the Turkey-Syria border. The smugglers claim they got the girls into Syria four or five days ago. The girls covered their faces and the smugglers managed to avoid Turkish surveillance, focussed on other crossings much closer to IS-held territory. The British police say that they told Turkey about the girls within a day. But Turkey insists that the UK didn’t move quickly enough. TRANSLATION: Countries such as Britain, which is famous for Scotland Yard, has not followed these three girls despite there being concerns about them. No-one stops you, or even notices you when you leave Istanbul’s main airport. We don’t know where the girls headed after this. But Istanbul’s bus station provides a simple and discreet route down to the border. It is incredibly easy to get the bus from Istanbul all the way to the border with Syria. A ticket costs £20 and the journey takes 14 hours. Do I show you my passport? No passport. OK. You can buy a ticket and you don’t have to show your passport. All you need is money. One former Turkish diplomat tells us it is time for his country to take a clear step. We should close the borders, that I believe, if we can. Because we don’t have any relations with Syria. No diplomatic relations. We don’t have an embassy there. We don’t have any official representative there. And we discourage our own people to go there. The British authorities represented here at the consulate say they will continue to work with their Turkish counterparts. But it is hard to see what, if anything, either government can now realistically do. Inside Syria, the three schoolgirls are out of reach. james Reynolds, BBC News, Istanbul. Our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, is at Scotland Yard. Let’s talk a bit about what today’s news means for the Metropolitan Police investigation. Yes, it’s bad news for the families and bad news for the Metropolitan Police here. They have just put out a short statement confirming they do believe the girls have crossed the border. The hope was always that they might still have been delayed in some way and still be in Turkey, giving a chance for the authorities to get to them before they did cross that border. Today, we did learn about some Dutch girls who had left and disappeared on Friday but who were picked up in Turkey before they crossed the border on Sunday and sent home immediately. But the British girls do appear to have crossed the border, putting them out of reach of the authorities. They do appear to also have crossed the border very quickly after arriving in Turkey which suggests they had a well-thought-out plan and good contacts to ta ke well-thought-out plan and good contacts to take them over. Now, we do understand that at least 30 British women are thought to have gone to Syria and Iraq and very few, one or two, have tried to get back. So, really, the fate of these three girls is in their own hands and the hands of whoever they are with. Thank you very much. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Conservative Foreign Secretary, is to stand down as a Member of Parliament at the coming election. Sir Malcolm acknowledged he may have made ‘errors ofjudgment’ after being secretly recorded, apparently offering his political services to a private firm for cash. He has denied any wrongdoing. He’s also resigned as chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee, as our political editor, Nick Robinson, reports. All political lives end in failure someone once said. On the day after all his defiance before, Sir Malcolm Rifkind did his best to prove it. Emerging from a meeting of Parliament’s Intelligence Committee, he quit as its chairman and announced he’d quit as an MP at the next election. I reflected on the situation last night. I could see that the issue was obviously an issue which was arousing public interest. I did not want the work of the committee to be distracted. Do you think you did anything wrong? No, I don’t think I did anything wrong. I may have made errors ofjudgment. Error ofjudgment one - boasting to a Chinese businesswoman who turned out to be an undercover reporter about how little work he did as an MP and how much he could earn giving a speech. Error ofjudgment two - not apologising for it. Are you sorry about all this? Of course, I’m very angry that people make allegations that I know to be unjustified and unfounded. Of course I’m not sorry, I’m absolutely livid. And error ofjudgment three - insisting that he was really entitled to a higher salary. I do also want to have the standard of living that my professional background would normally entitle me to have. That claim that he was entitled to earn more dried up much of the sympathy for a man who may actually not have broken any rules. Were you the author, do you think, of your own misfortunes in the sense that some of your comments yesterday clearly upset and angered many of your colleagues? If I used the word ""entitled"", that might not have been the right word. Why did a man who was fighting to save hisjob one day quit just 24 hours later? The answer is simple. Number Ten threatened to push Sir Malcolm Rifkind if he didn’tjump first, or, in the language they rather like in the Tory Party, they offered him a glass of whisky and a revolver and urged him to do the honourable thing! Almost 30 years ago, a young Malcolm Rifkind was made Scottish Secretary by Margaret Thatcher. john Major went on to make him first Defence Secretary and later Foreign Secretary. The experience which made him an obvious choice to chair the Parliamentary Committee which oversees the work of MI5, MI6 and GCHO. So why might Malcolm Rifkind think he’s entitled to earn more? If he was still Foreign Secretary, he’d be on £13lI,000 a year, but as a back bench MP he earns half that amount and for that work chairing the Intelligence and Security Committee, he earns nothing extra at all. But last year he did take home more than three times his salary from sitting on just three company boards. And that, claims some, doesn’tjust benefit him. Out of Parliament has to come people of the calibre to be Cabinet Ministers, all of whom, almost without exception, will otherwise in their life command very substantial salaries indeed. That looks set to be tomorrow’s debate. Are we better off without MPs like Malcolm Rifkind, who think they are entitled to do other work? Or worse off, if they leave politics for a quieter and, who knows, perhaps a better paid life? Nick Robinson, BBC News, Westminster. The 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar looks set to be held during November and December, after a recommendation by a Fifa task force. It says temperatures in the summer months would be too hot for football. If the plans are confirmed, European leagues would be severely disrupted - and the Premier League has already expressed its disappointment. From Qatar, our sports editor, Dan Roan, sent this report. Those at the top of Fifa have been looking for a way through one of the game’s biggest dilemmas for years and today, here in Doha, football’s power brokers finally settled on a date for the Qatar World Cup. There would not be one solution supported by all, but there is one solution which is coming out from these discussion, which is November/December 2022. Fifa says the soaring summer temperatures mean for the sake of fans and players, football’s showpiece event must be shifted from its traditional slot. But what will the fallout be from a winter tournament? European Leagues will be thrown into chaos with a seven-week break at the height of the season. The World Cup itself will be shortened to minimise the impact and clubs and broadcasters may seek compensation for the disruption. On behalf of all the European Leagues, and particularly the European clubs, who provide most of the players for this World Cup, the idea that we’ve turned up today - it was a pretty short meeting - to be told it’s going to happen in November/December, it’s very disappointing. I don’t have an issue with the World Cup being here. It should be played April, May, june, july, August in the conditions that they said in their bid book they could provide. The World Cup Final could now take place just two days before Christmas. But it may be a blessing in disguise for the England team and their manager. If I was Roy Hodgson, I’d be thinking brilliant, we’ve now got a chance of winning a major tournament because, for the first time ever, we have got the chance to go into a tournament with a fit, fresh team. And so, finally, Qatar knows when it will host its World Cup. But by breaking with decades worth of tradition here in Doha today, Fifa has deepened the divisions within the game and compounded the controversy that, for years now, has surrounded this country’s staging of the tournament. Qatar isn’t known for its football, but for these fans queueing to get into a Doha league match this week, today will feel like the build-up to the first World Cup in this region can finally begin. It offers people the opportunity to get to know the true Middle East and it offers the Middle East the opportunity to get to know the people on the outside and that is how you bridge the gaps. This is meant to be a new frontier for football. But whatever Fifa’s ambitions, they’re now overshadowed by events off the pitch. The credibility of those in charge of the sport hurt once again. Dan Roan, BBC News, Doha. Britain is to send up to 75 troops to Ukraine next month to help to train government forces there. The news came as pro-Russian rebels said they were pulling back heavy weapons from the front line in eastern Ukraine as part of a recent ceasefire deal. But the government in Kiev disputed the rebels’ claims. David Cameron says he’ll press for more sanctions against Russia if the rebels fail to observe the truce. Our diplomatic correspondent, james Robbins, is with me. The significance of the British decision today? This will be Britain’s first military involvement in Ukraine during this crisis, but David Cameron was very keen to stress to MPs when he announced this that the soldiers who are going to Ukraine will be, in his words ""away from any area of conflict."" The Ministry of Defence tell us about 75 service personnel will be going, starting with the next few days, actually. Divided into four teams. They will be training in medical skills skills logistics, intelligence and infantry skills to the Ukrainian army. This is as much a political signal from David Cameron as a military one. He wants this message to go through to Vladimir Putin saying, we are prepared to put some of our soldiers on the ground to strengthen Ukrainian forces. We are worried about your long-term intentions. David Cameron made clear the threat from Russia in the long-term is as great as Islamic extremists he is sending a message to Putin we want to reign you in now. You must not threaten other states. james Robbins there for us. Thank you. The United Kingdom has become the first country to legalise the creation of IVF babies using DNA from three people following a vote tonight in the House of Lords. Peers threw out a move by opponents to block the new law. It means some women who carry inherited diseases will now be able to have healthy children. The fertility regulator is to decide how to license the procedure. Eurozone finance ministers have approved Greece’s proposed changes to its bail out programme. The measures offered by Greece include combating tax evasion and reforming the public sector. European commissioners said the agreement had averted an immediate crisis. But other creditors said the plan still lacked detail and assurances. The prospect of the agreement on Greece’s bail out sent the FTSE 100 share index to an all time high today. The index broke the previous record set in 1999 - set at the height of the dotcom boom - after the news about Greece broke this afternoon. The leader of the Green Party, Natalie Bennett, has apologised to colleagues for what she called an ""excruciating"" performance in a radio interview about the party’s election priorities. She struggled to answer questions about the Greens’ plans to build half a million new homes. The party is fielding its largest ever slate of candidates in May, aiming to stand in 90% of seats in the general election. Our political correspondent, Vicki Young, reports. We’ve all had them, the kind of days which start with high hopes and expectations, but end up being, well, ones you’d rather forget. For Natalie Bennett, this was a chance to showcase the Green Party’s best policies. This is going to be our biggest, boldest campaign ever. Politicians need to have facts at their finger tips. Instead, Miss Bennett had what she described as ""an excruciating mental brain fade"", as she struggled to explain the party’s policy on housing during a radio interview. Right, what we’re looking at, in terms of the figures here. Yeah. What we need to do is actually... Ah... We’re looking at a total spend of £2.7 billion. But what is the total cost of 500,000 homes? Um... It’s about a cost of £60,000 per home. How are you going to pay for the land? Right. What we’re looking at doing is... is, basically... COUGHING. Are you all right? Sorry, yes. As you can probably hear, I’ve got a huge cold. I’m terribly sorry to hear that. Yeah. Later she told me she hadn’t been at her best. I didn’t do a greatjob this morning, I had a brainfade. That happens. What I’m aiming to do is to face up to that and then move on. Natalie Bennett’s cold may explain today’s performance, but she’s been under-fire before for vague answers. How can you hope to raise EAS billion... People are very welcome to have a look at the Green Party website and see how the figures are worked out. You would make it legal for people living here to be a member of Al-Qaeda or ISIS or the IRA. You’d make it legal to be a member of a terrorist organisation? Correct? Exactly. What we want to do is make sure we’re not punishing people for what they think, for what they believe. The Greens are enjoying a surge in popularity and with that comes greater scrutiny. You’d expect a party leader to be across policy details. For those who’ve turned to the party in recent months, looking for an alternative to the main Westminster parties, well maybe they won’t care too much about a couple of bad interviews. Vicki Young, BBC News. Westminster. The fall in global oil prices has hit energy producers around the world, in particular Russia where almost three-quarters of export income comes from gas and oil. It’s been a day of special BBC coverage of the worldwide impact of cheaper oil. From 2010, untilthe middle of last year, the cost of oil was about $100 a barrel. But since late june it’s roughly halved, trading at between $50-$60. In Russia, that cut in income, along with the impact of sanctions following the crisis in Ukraine, has increased the threat of recession as our economics editor, Robert Peston, reports from Moscow. The towering giants of Russia’s oil and gas industry, an industry that’s dominated the country’s economy, and provided more than a decade of rising prosperity and improving public services. But with a halfing of the oil price, it’s all falling apart and needs a spot of renovation. Russia is heading into a pretty severe recession. How bad do you think it’ll get? It depends on oil prices. If oil prices are standing at $50-$60 per barrel, as most analysts now are thinking, we are expecting the recession of 3%-1+% this year. Here in this central Moscow market it’s easy to see the pernicious impact on living standards of Russia’s tumbling currency, which has forced up prices. Oh, my goodness, lovely, mouthwatering produce, the problem is it’s becoming less and less affordable for Russian people. The collapse of the ruble means food price inflation is running at more than 20% a year. Russia tried to become a powerhouse of global capitalism and built this Moscow city as a rival to the City of London. Those ambitions have been put in the deep freeze, partly by falling oil, but also by sanctions imposed over Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. The buildings aren’t far off half empty and they’ve got some pretty unexpected te na nts. How is it exactly that you ended up opening a hostel in this extraordinary, modern skyscraper? We went to see this property, just for laughs, because we thought we couldn’t possibly afford this. A globally ambitious oligarch, Alexander Lebedev, owner of London’s Evening Standard and The Independent newspaper, along with his Russian assets. How serious are Russia’s economic problems? They’re very serious, there’s no doubt. Before it gets better, it’s going to get worse. These are the sequences you get from not having an independent parliament, a proper election, at least a bipartisan system, independent judiciary and free media. Finally, it’s all about that. When you have a bureauracy so over-powerful that the lack of any control regarding that makes the country completely inefficient. But the Kremlin and many Russians don’t see the economic woes as their own fault. They see the falling oil price and sanctions as economic warfare against them by America and the West. Russian people are poorer, they are less secure in theirjobs, but so far most of them don’t appear to be blaming the Russian government. Can President Putin count on their undying loyalty for ever? It’s certainly going to be a very interesting year. Robert Peston, BBC News, in Moscow.

A man has pleaded guilty to assaulting disabled pensioner Alan Barnes, for whom more than £300,000 was subsequently raised in donations. Mr Barnes is now preparing for a new life by house hunting for a place of his own with the money given. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Richard Gatiss was deeply ashamed of his actions. He’ll be sentenced later. In Northern Ireland, the Catholic Church has given its support to a proposed law allowing businesses to refuse to provide some services if their religious convictions might be undermined. The bill was drafted after a Christian-run bakery faced legal action for refusing to supply a cake with a gay marriage slogan on it. Opponents of the bill say that the so-called conscience clause would legalise discrimination. Our correspondent, Chris Buckler, has the story. An order for a cake unexpectedly contained all the ingredients for a bitter row, stirring up a debate about rights and responsibilities and leading to a clash between claims of conscience and allegations of discrimination. Ashers is a Belfast-based baking company. It refused to serve a customer who ordered a cake, iced with a message in support of gay marriage. Now, it’s being taken to court over claims it discriminated against the man on the grounds of sexual orientation. It’s become a heated debate in Northern Ireland and the Christian Institute is fundraising to help Ashers fight the case. Do you think it would have been the case that they would have turned down a cake that was trying to promote the heterosexual only ideal of marriage? That’s what the law in Northern Ireland already says. The law here in Northern Ireland is that marriage is between a man and a woman. You know there’s an ongoing debate and campaign about that. They would not be doing anything unlawful by doing that. How is it unlawful to bake a cake that’s in favour of gay marriage? Well, it’s... they’re promoting a campaign the law at present in Northern Ireland is that marriage is between a man and a woman. In response to the so-called gay cake row, the Democratic Unionist Party is proposing a conscience clause that would allow people to refuse others service based on their religious beliefs, but the gay community feels targeted. I’m dismayed when I read this DUP document because it tries to juxtapose people who are gay and people of faith, and I’m both. Some are now fearful that the conscience clause would effectively legalise homophobic discrimination. There are many, many religious people who are not at all happy with bludgeoning, with bashing gays. In the past, senior members of the DUP were involved in the Save Ulster from Sodomy campaign, which tried to prevent homosexuality being legalised. Although civil partnerships were made lawful a decade ago, the DUP has vowed to stop same-sex marriage from being introduced in Northern Ireland. At its party conference, it was raising money for the Ashers’ legal battle and making jokes about cakes over other questionable taste. I don’t know whether they’re called teacakes, cupcakes, fairy cakes or what kind of cakes they are. This kind of politics would not happen in GB. It would be laughed at in GB. But some unionist politicians feel their religious freedoms are being threatened by what they describe as the equality agenda. There has been a loss of kilter where things like gay rights have been used to try and trump religious rights. The heat over this issue remains and tensions will be raised again when the gay cake row is fought out in court. Chris Buckler, BBC News.

She felt like she couldn’t be British and a Muslim at the same time. She felt like this place wasn’t home for her. A warning not to leave glass ornaments on windowsills after a fire destroys a family home. Out of this world - the stunning visual effects which â8I’I’Iâd OFIE i.OI’IdoI’I COITIp8I’Iy BFI OSCBF. And changeable weather ahead. Your local and national forecast coming up. Good evening, I’m Riz Lateef. With three London schoolgirls now believed to have reached Syria in their bid tojoin the Islamic State, Muslim pupils in Hackney have been describing the pressures on teenagers to succumb to extremism. Meanwhile, charities that work to prevent young people being radicalised warn that girls following the path to IS thinking they’re helping vulnerable Muslims around the world are deluded. Alex Bushill reports. The disappearance of three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green bound for Syria has been felt across the capital, nowhere more so than in our schools and with young Muslim girls themselves. These three girls are at BSix College in Hackney. They are around the same age, model students too and also born and raised here in London. So how do they explain why they left? By leaving, you’re kind of saying, ""I don’t believe in God power, I don’t believe he can solve the world’s problems."" You’re saying, ""I’m going to take action, I’m going to go out there and do something,"" but what can you do if you’re 15-years-old and you’re in secondary school? I was really shocked and I was disappointed as well. One of the girls told me she knew a girl who attended a North London mosque who she said had been driven to take upjihad. She felt like she couldn’t be a British and a Muslim at the same time, she felt like this place wasn’t home to her. She used to wear a veil so every time she would go out, people were making silly comments about her faith so she had enough of this country and I think she was easily influenced by other people. At the heart of this is one simple question - why would intelligent, high-achieving students be seduced by one of the most oppressive regimes anywhere in the world? If you come here to Tower Hamlets and ask in some of its many Muslim communities, you will get a range of views, sometimes differing, sometimes contradictory. ",,

If you come here to Tower Hamlets and ask in some of its many Muslim communities, you will get a range of views, sometimes differing, sometimes contradictory. There are those who blame social media and sites like this, jihad Matchmaker, with its promises of adventure and romance. This woman, who runs a charity to combat that radicalisation, is among them. The romantic picture that you are going to find the love of your life, a warlord in Syria, and you’re going to marry and live happily ever after helping vulnerable Muslims who are suffering, I’m sorry, that is not reality. But others point to how extremist ideology can appeal to men and women. For me, one of the key issues is the ideological drive, this so-called extreme religious drive that is encouraging women and men and it makes no difference what gender you are. We seem to struggle with the idea that women can be drawn to extremism, or that women can be terrorists. Understanding why young, well-educated women are turning their backs on their families and homes forjihad thousands of miles away couldn’t be more important for London’s security and cohesion. And for the girls who go themselves. Alex Bushill, BBC London News. A family from Twickenham lost all their possessions, and their pet dog, in a fire which was started by sunlight being magnified through a glass jar. London Fire Brigade says more than a hundred fires have been caused by the sun’s rays in the last five years. Katharine Carpenter reports. The fire started up there. That’s my daughter’s bedroom at the back. Returning to what’s left of his home, Declan Murphy still can’t believe what’s happened. Or how quickly everything his family owned was destroyed. Utterly horrific, it’s just life-changing. You’re just stunned, numb, speechless. There’s nothing that can describe what goes through your head when you see your house on fire. It started in his daughter’s bedroom. She was keeping some rubber loon bands in a curved jar on the windowsill. In a terrible coincidence of circumstances, it refracted the sun’s rays setting fire to the blind. Certain objects have the ability to focus the sun’s rays, so if I demonstrate with the torch. If I shine it through, you will see quite clearly that it focuses the light on to a point. If that’s on a flammable object, in someone’s house, it has the potential to cause a fire. This is this bit where we might see the fire start? That’s right. It’s what happened on a far larger scale when the curvaceous ""walkie-talkie"" skyscraper melted parts of the city and four days after the Murphies’ fire, lingerie entrepreneur Michelle Mone tweeted that a mirror had set fire to a beanbag at her Mayfair home. You can’t put anything on your windowsill. If you’re in a south-facing garden, just get it off. You can’t have anything on your windowsill otherwise you’ll end up with a house like mine and I wouldn’t want that to happen to 3I’1yoIâ1â. Although they’ve been allowed back in their home to collect a few things, the Murphies will probably be in temporary accommodation for the next seven to nine months. When I asked Mr Murphy if he felt unlucky because of what had happened, he said, in fact, he felt very fortunate that his family wasn’t at home when the fire started, although they are still mourning their family pet, who couldn’t be saved. Katherine Carpenter, BBC London News. This Sunday, Chelsea will face Tottenham in the League Cup final at Wembley. Today, the chairman of the football-anti-racism group 'Kick it Out’ called on the police to ‘swamp’ the stadium. Tarah Welsh is here. And, Tarah, this follows a number of recent incidents involving racism among fans. That’s right. Lord Ousley was speaking after two separate incidents of racism on public transport last week. The first was when Chelsea supporters were filmed not letting a black man on a Metro train in Paris last week. The second was when a video emerged of a group of men chanting anti-Semitic abuse on a train in North London. They were believed to be West Ham fans. So, Lord Ousley says the police need to send a clear sign to racists. We want to see all the authorities come together to be prepared for Sunday’s game at Wembley, to swamp the place with security and police, to root out those who are coming looking for trouble, to be on those trains to stop the chanting and to make sure we are going to rid football of that element. Now, Chelsea have banned five fans since that video emerged and on Sunday they will be hoping the headlines are all about the football. Thank you. Around 1 in 50 children in the UK has a peanut allergy. For years it was thought that the way to deal with it was to keep them away from nuts. But now researchers from King’s College London say that letting babies as young as four-months-old try peanuts could dramatically reduce allergies in later life. jane Draper has the details. Eight-year-old Sofia’s diet is a delicate balancing act. As a baby she was allergic to soya, milk and egg. But Sofia can eat peanut products safely. She built up tolerance after she was given them from an early age in this carefully-run research. I didn’t know what was going to happen, so Ijust tried them and nothing happened. It was great actually. We found out a lot of things that we didn’t know, you know. We didn’t know there were so many children with allergies. Peanut allergy affects as many as 1in 50 schoolchildren in the UK. This trial involved more than 600 babies like Sofia who were at high-risk of becoming allergic to peanuts. In the group who avoided peanut products completely, 17% had become allergic to them by the time they were five-years-old. But in contrast, just 3% of the group who ate regular peanut snacks developed an allergy. This ground-breaking research shows that eating peanut products early on can actually help prevent allergy. The trials were done here at the Evelina Children’s Hospital in South London. Babies were given small amounts of this special peanut snack. We realised this goes very much contrary to previous advice but it is absolutely essential that we direct our attention to this group of infants and really stem this growing epidemic of the peanut allergy. Medical advice is needed before any child with allergies tries peanut snacks and no young child should ever be given whole nuts because of the risk of choking. But today’s research could eventually make a big difference to the lives of many more children like Sofia. Next, they’ve just won an Oscar for visual effects like this. The London-based company Double Negative scooped the Academy Award for their work on the sci-film Interstellar. Our entertainments correspondent, Brenda Emmanus, on why a business that started in the capital 17 years ago is impressing Hollywood in a big way. The Oscar goes to... Interstellar. Paul Franklin... It’s the film by one visionary director that led to an Academy Award for a London-based company. Interstellar, the ninth epic offering from Christopher Nolan, scooped visual effects firm Double Negative their second Oscar. It took a little while to recover. It was a big night after we got the award so we were out pretty late. I love you forever. While their colleagues prepared to return to the capital with their golden gong, those in their West End office reflected on the whole experience of making the movie. Generally, studios, or directors, don’t like to put all their eggs in one basket because if you put all of your work in one facility, if something goes wrong, then you’re stuck. But Chris just wanted to work with Double Negative. We did the entire movie here which is really - it is a pretty extraordinary accomplishment. Double Negative’s first Oscar came with Christopher Nolan’s 2010 science-fiction thriller Inception. Their latest project with the director stretched imaginations and fuelled creativity. How awesome is this, we used Cassini images to represent Saturn, and on the big-screen this makes us feel so small. Double Negative have recently published two scientific papers with the world’s leading astrophysicist Professor Kip Thorne. They have turned science-fiction into science fact by creating the most accurate depiction of a black hole ever seen. Everybody’s involved in this process to make it as great as possible and a good experience to everybody who works on it. I think on this movie particularly we achieved something quite extraordinary. Well, the Academy agreed. There you go! That’s it. It weighs about 10lb, it gets a bit hard holding on to it all night like that! So, with the addition of a television and animation division, as well as new offices abroad, this London company looks set for world domination. Brenda Emmanus, BBC London News. Time for me to wish you a very good night. And hand you over to Wendy Hurrell for a look at the weather. Thank you. Well, we have got some changeable weather on the cards, not least in terms of temperature. Cold to mild over the next few days and back again! That will happen a few times, I think. back again! That will happen a few times, Ithink. Out times, I think. Out there at the moment, temperatures are falling to A Celsius, they might go lower than that. Tomorrow night, in the same spots, we will be looking at 9 Celsius. A bit of clear sky in the east at the moment. We will lose that. The cloud is working in from the west. With that, the temperature will pick up through the night. It will bring us one or two outbreaks of rain. A bit of a drizzly, damp start to the day for the rush hour. It does clear away through the afternoon. We will have some sunshine. Eventually, round about nightfall, temperatures will be up at 12 degrees. For Thursday, nightfall, temperatures will be up at 12 degrees. ForThursday, it at 12 degrees. For Thursday, it is just about mild, after a mild night. Once the rain has come through, we are going to see it turn much colder through the afternoon. Tomorrow the winds will be lighter, generally speaking there will be more cloud around. Overall, it shouldn’t be such a bad day. This ugly mass of cloud has been around for quite some time now. It’s falling apart this area of low pressure and in its place, this area of cloud. There is a bit of mild air heading our way for the middle part of the week. You can see where the rain is through tonight. And to the far north of the country, so in northern and eastern Scotland, I think the skies will stay clear here and temperatures will dip below freezing. Let’s stick with the mild air first of all. This is the rush hour. You can see there is a bit of rain dotting around across the south of the country. Not too much. If anything, it is going to be mostly drizzle. 6 or 7 Celsius for most of us here. 5 Celsius at this stage in Belfast. You can see rain still encroaching from the west at this stage. And across the north and the east of Scotland we have some frost first thing. At least it will be sunny. The westerly to south-westerly winds will bring more cloud through the course of the day. Most of the rain - it won’t be heavy - will fall across the north-western areas. Across the hills of Wales, the Midlands, the South East, there could be some breaks in the cloud. The peak of the mild air is going to be crossing the country during Wednesday night. 10 degrees the overnight low. A cold front on Thursday, this band of rain here, early in the day, will waft away all of that mild air and we will be back into that fresher stream from the North Atlantic. A Celsius in Glasgow and a five-degree drop in Plymouth. At least there will be some sunshine. Friday won’t be such a bad day. Then, the weather will change as we head into the weekend. By the time we get to Sunday, it looks as though we will have a big low whistling across the UK. You know, you’re not a victim. You’re a failure. As a wife, as a mother. I told you to be careful with that girl! Robbie! # Everybody wants to rule the world. # # Welcome to your life... # This is not England. This is a godforsaken corner of a godforsaken country. You don’t work, you don’t eat! # There’s no turning back... # I will lie with the woman I love and you may hang me for it. Convict women belong to my soldiers. I’ll come to you tonight. # Everybody wants to rule the world. # I will not always be a convict. A new seven part drama... Four women are entering the great adventure of childbirth. Hear your waters go now, Anna. They’re all going about it in very different ways. SHE MOANS Forjo, there’s no doctors or midwives. It’s the hospital thing that I think is the madness, actually. Anna wants all the medical intervention money can buy. My obstetrician owns my birth. I’m going to have enough to do once the baby comes. Why should you suffer like somebody did 100 years ago? Lisa’s hanging onto her baby’s placenta... Kati’s eating it. That looks pretty nice, doesn’t it? I couldn’t think of anything more revolting. But you eat meat. But it’s not like my baby’s placenta. Four women, all determined to have the birth they want. Other women do judge you. We have so many choices in our lives now so why can’t we choose also how we’re going to give birth? Lovely, thank you. Oh, yummy, yummy. You’re not going anywhere. Childbirth - the perfect topic for ladies who lunch. My first labour was more than 30 hours. Phew! Yeah. Every labour was just horrendous. I’m hanging onto the kitchen worktops going, ""Grr!"" Like this. He said, ""what’s the matter?"" ""Uh-huh, I’m having a baby."" Soaking it up and putting a brave face on it is 31+-year-old Anna. She’s expecting her second child in a few weeks. I mean, I originally thought I was dying, cos I didn’t think anyone could actually go through this much pain and survive it. I’m completely for drugs in childbirth. Why should you suffer like somebody did 100 years ago? Why should you suffer? That’s not why they created these drugs. If you’re relaxed and stress free, then the baby... If you’re relaxed, it makes a big difference. Of course they are. You know, some women can just drop a baby... In the supermarket. Yeah. Water births. Women lying in this horrible water that they give birth in, which I think is disgusting. Oh, what, water births? Water births. Yeah, I don’t like the idea of that, you see. Oh, neither do I. Somebody else’s primordial soup. I don’t want to give birth in that. You see these women go, ""Oh, oh, oh,"" and their husbands are kissing them and a baby comes out and it’s all subdued music. It’s all lovely, yeah, yeah. It’s not like that. That’s not real. Wakey-wakey. Yeah. It’s not like that at all. Anna’s birth will be a more predictable affair. ",,

Still, better make sure! To the watching media it has all been great fun. But the man in the suit insists it is supposed to be very realistic. TRANSLATION: Istudied how the leopard moves. The most important thing is not to look like the real animal, but to move like the real animal. Still, not everyone is convinced. Was it scary, he asks this little boy.

Some amazing pictures to share with you now from South Korea, where the ground literally collapsed beneath the feet of these two pedestrians in Seoul. They were swallowed up as the pavement gave way and had to be rescued by the fire brigade. You’ll be glad to hear they survived and suffered only minor injuries. It’s not yet clear what caused the ground to collapse, although the role of a nearby construction site is being investigated. But nothing is confirmed whatsoever. Briefly the main news again - But nothing is confirmed whatsoever. Briefly the main news again - the BBC learned the three schoolgirls from London have crossed into Syria about three days ago. It is feared they are in the control of the group Islamic State. Thanks for watching. Good morning. Our weather Islamic State. Thanks for watching. Good morning. Ourweather is Good morning. Our weather is on the turn to something more cloudier and also mielter as well. That process starts on Wednesday. We have the mild out in the Atlantic now. This colour here is where the mild area is, pushing towards us throughout the day. It won’t be with all of us today, at least to begin with. You will notice a frost through the night and into the morning across Scotland and north-east England, but contrast that with towards south-west England - contrast that with towards south-west England -10 degrees as we start the day. But it is in the milder air where weave the cloud. Outbreaks of rain and heavier bursts around in the morning, certainly for the first few hours, but eases off in intensity and becomes light rape and drizzle across south-west England and parts of Wales,tyly for the hills at 8:00. A few splashes of rain to the south and east but already signs of the cloud thinning towards the east of the wesh mountains and across the West Midlands and to the east of the Pennines. Should be frost-free in Northern Ireland, outbreaks of rain, a bit of cloud in western Scotland but a dryer, drieter start for many and as I said very cold in some parts of the north-east with temperatures at -5 or minus six. The cold air will hold on throughout the day, not especially warm, but elsewhere we see the cloud thin and break at times. A bit of sunshine, a lot more cloud than recent days, but into the afternoon, a good part of Scotland, Northern Ireland, western England and Wales will be predominantly cloudy. Outbreaks of rain and drizzle, the heaviest across parts of Scotland. Snow on the mountains, the Grampians, fora short while but that is ease later. Temperatures across southern and western areas 10-12 degrees. The warm air is behind this front which pushes through on Wednesday night. It could hover at 10 degrees for some through the night and into the morning. The weather front pushes southwards reintroducing colder air. Thursday starts with outbreaks of rain, clouds into the south-east corner into the afternoon, and then sunnier weather develops and colder weather very best. Colder weather was we go into Friday. A scatter around here and there. The milder air tries to push back in again on Saturday but then into Sunday we keep a very close eye on this - a developing and quite deep area of low pressure potentially for Sunday, which could bring some very strong winds and heavy rain to many parts of the country. Bye for now. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Mike Embley. British police says they have received information that three London schoolgirls, missing from their homes since last week, have successfully made their way to Syria to join Islamic State. The BBC understands that the girls were smuggled across the border from Turkey four or five days ago. At least 70 Christian men, women and children are believed to have been abducted by Islamic State militants in north-eastern Syria. The kidnappings took place after militants seized villages from Kurdish forces. Syrian forces had launched offensives on Sunday, led by American air strikes. At least 27 people have been killed in two suicide bombings in northern Nigeria. However, the country’s President Goodluckjonathan has claimed the tide has turned in the fight against the Boko Haram Islamist militants. He said rapid progress was being made in recovering territory seized by the group in the north-east. Sir Malcolm Rifkind is to stand down as an MP in the upcoming election. He has acknowledged he may have made errors ofjudgement in apparently offering his services to a private firm for cash. Now on BBC News, all the latest business news live from Singapore. A volatile day on Asian markets as US Federal bank chiefjanet Yellen urges flexibility over interest rates. A meal, time with friends, or a shower? What would you give up to be able to surf the Internet on your mobile phone? Hello, and welcome. You are watching the Wednesday edition of Asia Business Report on BBC World News. I am edition of Asia Business Report on BBC World News. Iam Rico BBC World News. I am Rico Hizon. The chair of the US Federal reserve, jarrett, a janet Yellen, has made a clear interest rates in America will not go up until the middle of the year at the earliest. They have helped markets rise to record levels overnight. She emphasised the US recovery was on course, though not yet secure. Michelle Fleury reports. And she was feeling under pressure, she didn’t show it. janet Yellen runs the central bank of the world’s largest economy. Decisions have the power to affect us all. As she began two days of hearings, she was clear. Long-term unemployment has declined substantially. Fewer workers are reporting they can find only part-time work when they would prefer full-time employment. And the pace of quitting, often referred to as a barometer of Labour market opportunities, has recovered nearly to its prerecession level. At the body that sets interest rates, the Federal open market committee, or FOMC, is not declaring victory yet. Not with wage growth stunted and muted. The committee considers it unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the target range for the Federal funds raised for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings. janet Yellen’s remarks were designed to give the central bank flexibility as it comes closer to raising interest rates, in case of risks, including those from abroad. Foreign markets are facing a number of challenges that could restrain economic activity. In China, economic growth could slow more than anticipated. And it wasn’t just lawmakers listening closely. On Wall Street, investors liked what they heard. Stocks closed at fresh highs. janet Yellen used her first day of testimony to provide greater clarity on the timing of the first interest rate hike. Most investors here on Wall Street still think that such a move is likely injune or September. But whenever America’s Central Bank does increase interest rates on the world’s largest economy, it will be the world ‘s first such increased since 2006. Kolodjashnij in other market moving headlines, the bailout programme. The measures offered by Greece include sector in exchange for a four month extension of its bailout. Meanwhile Chinese manufacturing seems to be edging up to a four month high. HSBC studies also show export orders shrinking at their fastest rate in 20 months. Burbury’s flash purchasing managers index or PM I read 50.1 for the month, a fraction above the 50 point level which indicates growth in activity. Asian markets are reacting with volatility to those developments, as investors digests the PMI numbers from China and janet Yellen’s statement on interest rates. Currently you have the Nikkei five in positive territory but only marginally, while the ASX All Ordinaries index is higher by about 18 points. The Hang Seng is lower by 15 points as they await a crucial Budget from the... From Parliament, in about 30 minutes because time. And all of the major Wall Street indices soaring to new record highs overnight with the Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 in record ground. And within the next half-hour, Hong Kongis And within the next half-hour, Hong Kong is due to release its Budget and reveal whether and how it will reflect the months of pro-democracy protests and pressure to address social concerns. Struggling on low wages were what housing, old age benefits, and education to be on the agenda, while the business community hopes for tax incentives. I was joined earlier by an analyst from Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government is certainly not top of the popularity polls, that is for sure, as was witnessed by two months of protests last year. So I think there is a lot of pressure and incentive on the government to come forward with the lot of freebies and giveaways that perhaps can be construed as buying itself some votes. So I think we are going to expect to see certain I-off rebates that are going to be handed out, rebates on public housing rents, for example, rebates on taxes, rebates on rates payable on property. And secondly there will be more permanent measures which will be quite significant. I think Tom for example, we are going to see that the young benefit and the old benefit, for example, there will be a raising, Ithink, of Child allowances in the tax code, and there will be a significant increase in benefits as well. OK, that is bridging the gap to in the rich and the poor. What about the competitiveness of Hong Kong? Which it may have lost during the protests late last year? I’m not sure it lost a lot of competitiveness during the protest. I think there are other reasons for that. For example the very high cost of doing business in Hong Kong, particularly on the housing and property front, I think is very negative. Also an education. So I am expecting to see Budget proposals to improve and increase education, particularly for the international level, and I am expecting to see, certainly, supplements or something to help bring down the cost of housing, and increase the supply of housing, going forward. This is a long-term problem, not a short-term one. Peter Church house on the Hong Kong Budget which will be released in around 25 minutes’ time. Shares and Hewlett- Packard Shares and Hewlett-Packard have fallen as earnings for the january quarter show a revenue decline of more than 4%. Sales of desktop computers declined sharply from one year ago levels. The company says the result reflects a week demand from its services from corporate customers. How attached to you to your smartphone? For many of us, being online all the time is now as familiar as taking online all the time is now as familiaras taking a familiar as taking a shower or eating Breakfast. But what would you be willing to give up for a mobile Internet connection? That question was part of a study which we will hear more about in a minute. At first, let’s see how people here in Singapore answered. ~ I use my phone i USE my pi’10Iâ1â VâI’y could a up a meal a day for at! Yes. If there is one thing I have to give UP If there is one thing I have to give up to use my Internet on my phone, that would be meeting my friends. I would give up having Internet to be able to shower, because that is important to me. No, I definitely wouldn’t give up showering. Personal hygiene is very important to me. I use my phone in the shower though, because I listen to the radio while a shower. I wouldn’t give up Internet for showering. I mean, I have to shower every day. I wouldn’t give up anything. I needed. I can’t live without it -- I would give up anything. I live without it. Whatever you yourself would have answered, there is no doubt that mobile Internet is indeed a rapidly growing market. Revenue in the top five Asia-Pacific countries, five Asia- Pacific countries, Australia, five Asia-Pacific countries, Australia, China, India, japan, South Korea, stands at 300 billion US dollars, more than the US and than twice the 5 biggest European countries combined. By 2017 revenue is expected to more than double to $622 billion. Philip Hammond she spoke to are represented from the Boston consulting group which is behind the study and asked him which market is growing the fastest in Asia. the fastest-growing is India, and India is growing from a very low base but the forecast is that the mobile Internet will triple between today and 2017, in size. The biggest is China. Which at 1.4 5 billion dollars of revenue today is already the bigger than the European five. So it actually represent a very, in the next three years. Now what did this mean for companies in that region and how they go about their strategies? So for companies operating in the region I think there are couple of big paperweights. One of them is that as a go to market Avenue, the mobile Internet represents a tremendous opportunity to connect with your customer. So figuring out the best way to do that, whether you are an online retailer or whether you are a newspaper, whatever business you are in, figuring out how to use the mobile Internet is a fantastic opportunity to generate growth for your business. And then secondly, it creates an opportunity for people to think about developing mobile Internet based businesses. Now you have also asked people what they would be willing to give up in order to maintain their access to the mobile Internet. Some of those answers are quite interesting. Well, we found some very surprising answers. In China, 30% of people said they would be willing to give UP said they would be willing to give up both sex and showering, rather than giving up the mobile Internet. And similarly in South Korea, it was 30% of people willing to give up sex and 20% showering. So I think people are fairly attached to their phones. Interesting study. Thank you for investing your time with us. I am Rico Hizon, you have been watching Asia Business Report. The top stories this hour: British police say they have received information that three London schoolgirls who disappeared last week have made their way to Syria. Islamic State militants are reported to have abducted as many as 150 people from Assyrian Christian villages in north-eastern Syria, following fighting with Kurdish forces. The leader of the Green Party, Natalie Bennett, has apologised to colleagues for what she called an excruciating’ performance in a radio interview about the party’s election priorities. She struggled to answer questions about the Greens’ plans to build 500,000 new homes. Our political correspondent Vicki Young reports. We’ve all had them, the kind of days which start with high hopes and expectations, but end up being, well, ones you’d rather forget. For Natalie Bennett, this was a chance to showcase the Green Party’s best policies. This is going to be our biggest, boldest campaign ever. Politicians need to have facts at their finger tips. Instead, Ms Bennett had what she described as ""an excruciating mental brain fade"", as she struggled to explain the party’s policy on housing during a radio interview. Right, what we’re looking at, in terms of the figures here. Yeah. What we need to do is actually... Ah... We’re looking at a total spend of £2.7 billion. But what is the total cost of 500,000 homes? Um... It’s about a cost of £60,000 per home. How are you going to pay for the land? Right, well what we’re looking at doing is... Is, basically... COUGHING. Are you alright? Sorry, yes. As you can probably hear, I’ve got a huge cold. I’m terribly sorry to hear that. Yeah. Later she told me she hadn’t been at her best. I didn’t do a greatjob this morning, I had a brain fade. That happens. What I’m aiming to do is to face up to that and then move on. Natalie Bennett’s cold may explain today’s performance, but she has been under fire before for giving vague answers. How can you hope to raise £45 billion... People are very welcome to have a look at the Green Party website and see how the figures are worked out. You would make it legal for people living here to be a member of Al-Qaeda or ISIS or the IRA. You’d make it legal to be a member of a terrorist organisation, correct? Exactly. What we want to do is make sure we’re not punishing people for what they think, for what they believe. The Greens are enjoying a surge in popularity, and with that comes greater scrutiny. And you’d expect a party leader to be across policy details. For those who’ve turned to the party in recent months, looking for an alternative to the main Westminster parties, well maybe they won’t care too much about a couple of bad interviews. Vicki Young, BBC News, Westminster. Much more on that our website. And you can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. I’m @BBCMikeEmbley. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. Hello, I’m Marc Edwards and this is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up on this programme: Advantage Barcelona - Luis Suarez puts Manchester City to the sword in the Champions League. Davis Love III has been named the next US Ryder Cup captain to take on Europe at Hazeltine next year. Master Marquez is back - the Spaniard sets the pace at Moto GP testing in Sepang. Hello, thanks forjoining us. We’re going to kick off with the first leg of the Champions League last 16 ties, where Barcelona have beaten Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad courtesy of a Luis Suarez brace. Sergio Aguero was on target for the home side. Earlier on, I spoke to our football correspondent, john Bennett, for his take on the match in Manchester. Barcelona WE FE B Barcelona were a class above in the first half, and join Barcelona. He has had a mixed start to his career at has been involved in in his first 23 Barcelona games. He scored nine, the rest were assists. Two excellent finishes as well, and Manchester City were completely played off the park in the first 45 minutes. The second half was a different story. Certainly early on jecko had a great chance for City and wasted that tunt, then Sergio Aguero got a goal back for Manchester City, gave them hopein back for Manchester City, gave them hope in the tie and perhaps the comeback was on. They came back Bayern Munich earlier in the season - were they going to come back against Barcelona? Not this time, as they received a bookable offence from a ridiculous challenge. Then drama right at the end - Lionel Messi won a penalty. Zabaleta with the foul, Messi steps up - surely it’s going to be 3-1? No! The save is made, rebounds back to Lionel Messi, he has an open goal and a diving header and it goes wide. So an unbelievable game. Should have been 3-1 to Barca. So perhaps Manchester City will see themselves as fortunate that it was only 2-1. There we can see confirmation of that result. In the other Tuesday night tie, Serie A champions juventus beat Bundesliga strugglers Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at home. Goals from Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata for the Italians and Marco Reus on the scoresheet with what could prove to be a crucial away goal for Dortmund. Monaco will take on Arsenal in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie at the Emirates Stadium in London on Wednesday. That’s after the French side reached the knockout stages for the first time in ten years. It’s a club that Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger knows well, the Ligue 1 side giving the Frenchman his big break in management in the late 1980s. just to warn you, Ben Smith’s report does contain some flash photography. Arsene, who Arse ne, who read the Frenchman arrived at Arsenal in 1996. Well, nearly 20 years later, he is Arsenal’s longest-serving manager and he is Arsenal’s longest-serving managerand their manager and their most successful. But thisjourney to manager and their most successful. But this journey to north London began in the south of France. It’s the start of my career and I didn’t know how long I would be in thejob and where I would be, you know? And it’s my first chance to be in a big club. I was very young and you are always grateful for that. On the Cote did’ Azur he is revered for the games he won and the young French superstars he ushered in. As a coach he commanded respect. You can see the personality and strong character he has got. He is a gaffer who knows exactly what he wants. He really brought the club to a different level. When he was the gaffer here. The calm waters hee belie turbulent time for the Principalities Football Club. Since Wenger left, 16 managers have come and gone as the club went from a Champions League final to the brink of France’s third tier. The club’s famous stadium is here in Monaco where one in three of the 36,000 residents are millionaires. If I cross over the road I walk over the border and into France - and that’s where Monaco are determined to win the title once again. Russian money has renewed their hopes. Last season, the This will be an emotional first reunion come kick-off, there will be no room for sentiment. Monaco have experience of playing English sides. They’ve done it ten times in Europe, winning five and losing two, but this is their first competitive game against Arsenal. Dimitar Berbatov is a player who knows a thing or two about the Premier League, having spent time with Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Fulham. He thinks Arsenal are the favourites. We know it’s going to be a difficult game, obviously. We are the underdog in this game, and Arsenal are the favourite to win it, but we came for a good result and hopefully we can achieve it. We prepare well for the game, and because I spent here a couple of years, I told my team-mates - and they know - it’s going to be a tough game. The chairman of the European Clubs’ Association has warned they would expect financial compensation for any seasonal disruption during the Qatar World Cup. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was speaking out after a FIFA task force recommended playing the 2022 tournament in November and December, to avoid the Gulf state’s hot summer. Richard Conway reports from Doha. The tag line for this World Cup from the Qatari organisers is that they want to deliver ""Amazing"" as they put it. But what the European clubs and leagues expected was that they would deliver a summer tournament. Now, thatjust isn’t going to happen now. The decision that has been made by FIFA’s task force will see, subject to that ratification next month, which I believe will be a formty, this World Cup moving to late November and to late December. That will be a historic first for the World Cup to go along with the historic first of taking a World Cup into the Middle East and into an Islamic country. The European clubs and leagues have been very vocal today. They’ve demanded compensation. They don’t feel that they should be the ones that have to PPV they should be the ones that have to pay the price for what they believe is FIFA’s mistake. For the Qataris, they are delighted. There is a palpable sense of relief here in Doha tonight that they through that now the situation is a little clearer, there is a milestone on this path towards a World Cup, and they are looking forward to the next seven years of starting to build this World Cup and then delivering it in 2022 - albeit in winter time. The PGA of America has announced that Davis Love will captain the United States Ryder Cup team at Hazeltine next year. The 1997 US PGA Champion skippered the American side in 2012 lose to Europe in what became known as ""The miracle at Medinah"". This group is about a team winning. We’re building a team of captains. We are building a family that’s going to pull together. We’re like a football team, like a basketball team - like Dean Smith’s teams that always brought back the players in the summer and taught the younger players how to play. A lot of respect and a lot of love with that, and that passion will come out and we’ll have a lot more fun. We’ll give ourselves a better chance to succeed. Defending MotoGP champion Marc Marquez returned to the top of the pre-season testing timesheets at the Sepang circuit in Malaysia on Tuesday. On the second day of the penultimate test before the season begins, the Spanish Repsol-Honda rider set the pace. Marquez was one of only two riders to break the two minute mark as he claimed the top spot. |,m I’m happy because, you know, the problem from yesterday has gone, and thatis problem from yesterday has gone, and that is important, and we start to try a few things and, you know, we didn’t have time to try everything, so tomorrow we will continue. Maybe I will not have time to do the long run - we will see. But the priority and the most important is finishing this test with everything clear for Honda. Now to rugby union. Wales have made four changes to their 6 Nations side to face France on Saturday. Coach Warren Gatland welcomes back George North, after the winger suffered concussion in Wales’ defeat to England. Samson Lee, Luke Charteris and Scott Baldwin have also been drafted into the starting 15. Wales head to Paris looking to repeat their win from 2013 and captain Sam Warburton says these are the games every player lives for. ~ I would much rather a game like this against France where it is a must-win game compared to playing, you know, a tier three or tierfour nation at home where you are expected to win by 15 points. It’s much more exciting - there’s a lot more tension on the training ground and a little bit of - it’s a good energy. It is a much more enjoyable test to be involved in. It is really exciting as players to have a game like this coming up on the weekend, against a top team, away from home as well. It is a massive challenge but it is one which you really enjoy playing in. World number three Andy Murray is through to the second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships after a straight sets victory over Gilles Muller- Murray’s Luxembourg opponent taking 30 points to finally hold serve in the third game of the first set. Murray eventually came through 6-4, 7-5 in1 hour and 45 minutes. Next up, he will play world number 50, joao Sousa. You can get all the latest sports news at our website - that’s bbc.com/sport. But from me, Marc Edwards, and the rest of the Sport Today team, goodbye. Our weather will be turning to something cloudier, but also milder. That process starts through Wednesday. We have got the weather out in the Atlantic. Mild air is pushing towards us throughout the day. You will notice a frost through the night into the morning across parts of Scotland. Contrast that with Southwest England. 10 degrees as we start the day. It is in the milder air that we have the cloud and outbreaks of rain. It uses off and becomes light green and drizzle across south-west England and parts of Wales. A splash of ring to the south and east. ~ --8 -- afew -- a few splashes of rain to the south and east, but clouds thing across parts of the West Midlands and the pen nice. Should be frost-free in Northern Ireland, outbreaks of rain and a bit of cloud in western Scotland but a dry and bright start for many and very cold in some parts of the north-east with temperatures at -5 or minus six. The cold air will hold on throughout the day here, not especially warm, but elsewhere we will see the cloud thin and break at times. Not a lot of sunshine but cloud over the days. Some outbreaks of rain and drizzle, the heaviest of which across parts of Scotland. Snow on the mountains for a short while but that will ease back to rain later and temperatures across some southern and western GCFOSS SOTTIE SOUtiâ1âI’Iâ1 and WâStâI’Iâ1 GFESS across some southern and western areas 10-12 degrees. The warm air is really behind this front which pushes through well and truly for Wednesday night. Heavier rain on this weather front as it pushes southwards through Thursday, reintroducing colder air. So England and Wales start Thursday, cloudy, outbreaks of rain, some of which will be heavy. Clears away from the south-east corner into the afternoon, then sunnier weather develops, colder weather and a scattering develops, colder weather and a scattering of showers for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Those being a mixture of rain, sleet and also snow. Temperatures through the afternoon probably lower than you start the day - 4-9 degrees at the very best. Into colder weather as we go into Friday. Dryer and brighter weather to come on Friday. Showers scattered around and a blustery day. The milder area tries to push back in on Saturday from the Atlantic but on Saturday we keep an eye on this, a developing area of low pressure potentially for Sunday which could bring strong winds and heavy rain to many parts of the country. Bye for now. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Mike Embley. Our top stories: The BBC tracks the three London schoolgirls who have crossed into Syria to join Islamic State. No word on the fate of dozens of Christians abducted by Islamic State militants after fighting in north-eastern Syria. Two bombings in northern Nigeria kill at least 27, but the president says the tide has turned in the fight against Boko Haram militants. And how many manatees can you fit in a storm drain? It’s not a joke, but it does have a happy ending. The BBC has learnt that the three missing schoolgirls from East London crossed into Syria about five days ago. British counter terrorism police have also confirmed they believe the girls, Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, are already in Syria. It is feared they’re under the control of the extremist group Islamic State. They travelled to Istanbul in Turkey a week ago. Sources inside Syria have told the BBC the girls crossed near the Kilis border crossing. It is believed they were helped by people smugglers. Our correspondent james Reynolds has the details from Istanbul. Tonight, it seems clear that schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase have made it through Turkey, and into Syria. Contacts tell the BBC that the three are with a smuggler affiliated to the so-called Islamic State. The three flew out of Gatwick a week ago, during half-term. Amira had told her father that she was going to a wedding. Sources tell us that the three girls, and the smugglers, prepared for the crossing near Kilis on the Turkey-Syria border. The smugglers claim that they got the girls into Syria four or five days ago. The girls covered their faces, and the smugglers managed to avoid Turkish surveillance, focussed on other crossings much closer to IS- held territory. The British police say that they told Turkey about the girls within a day. But Turkey insists that the UK didn’t move quickly enough. TRANSLATION: A country such as Britain, which is famous for Scotland Yard, has not closely followed these three girls despite there being concerns about them. We were informed three days after they left Heathrow and came to Istanbul. No-one stops you, or even notices you, when you leave Istanbul’s main airport. We don’t yet know exactly where the girls headed after this. But Istanbul’s bus station provides a simple and discreet route down to the border. It is incredibly easy to get the bus from Istanbul all the way to the border with Syria. A ticket only costs about £20, and the journey takes about 14 hours. One to Gaziantep. Do I have to show you my passport? No passport, OK. So you can buy a ticket to Gaziantep and you don’t have to show yOUIâ p8SSpoI’l. All you need is money. One former Turkish diplomat tells us that it is now time for his country to take a clear step. We should close the borders, that I believe, if we can. Because we don’t have any relations with Syria. No diplomatic relations. We don’t have an embassy there. We don’t have any official representative there. And we discourage our own people to go there. The British authorities represented here at the consulate say that they will continue to work with their Turkish counterparts. But it is hard to see what, if anything, either government can now realistically do. Inside Syria, the three schoolgirls are out of reach. james Reynolds, BBC News, Istanbul. The Christian men, women and children believed to have been abducted by Islamic State militants on Tuesday be higher still, with one group putting the number at 150. province, near the cities of Tal Tamr and Hassakah. The abducted people are thought to be members of the Assyrian Christian minority. Christians are believed to have constituted about 10% of Syria’s 22 million people, before the uprising began four years ago. Of those, 40,000 are Assyrians. They have been based in the region for centuries, but their numbers have fallen dramatically recently because of persecution. The largest concentration of Assyrians in Syria is in Hassakeh province, where the kidnappings took place, but there are also smaller communities in Aleppo, Homs and Damascus. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross is an American counter-terrorism scholar and analyst at defence of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank. Good to talk to you. What do you think is going on here? What are Islamic State up to? It is not clear that this is a major change in their strategy. They have been persecuting religious minorities including Christians for quite sometime. This is also around the area where they committed those atrocities last year against the Yazidis, basically embarking on a project of genocide against them. The fact that they have captured this area should be understood in the context of the fact that they have just had a brutal beheading of dozens of Coptic Christians. That is going to influence us in a few ways. Obviously that these men, women, and children may be killed and it is obvious the Islamic State may try to leverage that to sell them off as hostages, eventually. And part of the point, I gather, maybe to attract the attention of the West, perhaps to draw the West further into this conflict. How is the West likely to respond, do you think? It is possible that is the intention, but not entirely clear. It is hard to read, sometimes, what precisely they are doing. If example this relates more to their financial needs, and the available evidence shows that an Islamic State is in fact hurting financially, then it could be a little bit different than being about us. In terms of how the West response, I don’t think it is going to be that different than what we are already doing. The United States and its allies, UK and other coalition partners, are engaged in a bombing campaign. And I think that it needs more strategy. But this isn’t the kind of thing that is necessarily going to make us more strategic in the fight against the Islamic State. And it is not as though there is any lack of atrocities. I mean, people were saying the same thing when the jordanian pilot was burnt to death. That this may be designed to draw the West End, what are we going to do? In the same thing, to quote spinal tap, they have turned up to 11 in terms of the atrocities that they have committed, and they have been if a while. And do you see these atrocities as a sign of the strength of Islamic State, or its weakness -- Spinal Tapp. strength of Islamic State, or its weakness -- SpinalTapp. I weakness -- Spinal Tapp. I would say neither. They have been engaged in massive atrocities for quite sometime. My own view is that the Islamic State is very vulnerable, and one of the recent they are very vulnerable is because of all the atrocities they have committed. -- one of the reasons. They are in a declining phase and are committing atrocities, and I think the escalation in atrocities is basically designed to keep topping what they have already done. They have a very... Strategic is a bad word to use, but they have a sense of drama, of how to terrorise people, keep them watching, and keep them horrified. Thank you very much. My pleasure. The Nigerian President Goodluck jonathan says the tide has turned in the fight against Boko Haram. He said Nigeria’s army and allies were making rapid progress in recovering territory seized by the Islamist group in the north-east. But his comments came after 27 people were killed in two suicide bomb attacks on bus stations. The blasts occurred in Kano, the largest city in the north, and in the town of Potiskum. Laura Westbrook has the details. This is the aftermath of another suicide bomb attack in Nigeria, the result of a strike on a major bus station in the northern city of Kano. It seems that the two bombers came as passengers from outside the city, so they came in, were driven in as passengers, in the process of moving out. After arriving at the motor park, that was the time they decided to detonate the bomb. A witness there describes the attack. TRANSLATION: I am a union member. I came here to collect my union fees. I saw the two guys, and the way they looked, I did not trust them. But I did not pay attention since I don’t work here. After I reached the branch office, I suddenly heard the blast and saw many people on fire. This was the second strike in a day. just hours earlier there was a blast in the town of Potiskum. A witness said the bomber blew himself up while trying to board a bus. Nigeria’s President Goodluck jonathan blamed Boko Haram for the attacks. He said this. The Nigerian military said they have taken back the border town of Baga. These military exercises were held in Chad over the weekend, to prepare a joint task force to fight the Islamist militants. More than 10,000 people were killed by Boko Haram last year. The tide may be turning. What is clear though is this is going to be a long, hard fight. President Obama has vetoed a Republican backed bill which would have approved the Keystone XL oil pipeline. First proposed more than six years ago, the pipeline would connect the long-standing process for evaluating the project. It is just the third veto of Obama’s presidency. A massive clean-up operation is under way in California where a commuter train slammed into a truck which had been abandoned on the tracks. Three carriages were sent tumbling onto their sides when the accident happened about 120 kilometres outside of Los Angeles. 28 people were injured. The BBC’s David Willis has more. The sprawling wreckage of an early-morning commuter train bound for Los Angeles, after it collided with a lorry left abandoned on the track. Amateur video, taken minutes after the crash, shows a giant fireball and the vehicle engulfed by flames. The collision split the scorched vehicle in two, and catapulted part of it several yards down the line. The lights went out, and itjust seemed like slow motion, seemed like it took forever. We were doing about 60 mph. The gates were down. Engineer definitely had his emergency brake set. We were slowing down as we hit them. 28 were taken to hospital- some suffering head and spinal injuries. Among of those who escaped injury was the lorry driver who is currently helping police with their enquiries, but it seems he may simply have taken a wrong turn. One of our patrol officers saw what he believed to be a disoriented male walking approximately 1-2 miles south of the accident scene on Rice Avenue. He was not injured in the incident, however, he was taken to a local hospital for observation and treatment. As rescue workers search for trapped passengers, the entire LA area metrolink system was shut down. A federal investigation into the crash is now under way. Hundreds of climbers are waiting to find out whether they can scale Mount Everest. They were forced to abandon their expedition last year when local Sherpas went on strike over the deaths of 16 colleagues. Authorities promised that permits would be valid for at least five years but the climbers say they are now in limbo while the Nepalese government decides whether to honour its promise.

Sea levels north of New York City rose by 128mm in two years, according to a report in the journal, Nature Communications. Coastal areas will need to prepare for short term and extreme sea level events, say US scientists. Climate models suggest extreme sea level rises will become more common this century. jianjun Yin is a co-author of the report. He joins me now from Arizona. What do you think is going on here? So the report is out and it indicates that from 2009 to 2010 coastal areas from New York City to Newfoundland jumped by more than 100mm on average. So, this extreme US sea level rise rate did not happen before in the data history and our statistical analysis indicates that this event was a one-in 850-year event based on our data. So it is very, very unusual. So why do you think it happened and why do you think it happened on this stretch of coast? Our analysis indicates that this extreme sea level event and the inter-annual timescale was caused by the change in the ocean, especially the 30% downturn of the Atlantic and Mediterranean circulation in 2009 and 2010. So in addition, the very negative oscillation index also contributed to this extreme sea level rise. Do you expect it to happen again, and more widely? Yes. Actually, the climate model results projection indicates an increase in magnitude and the frequency of extreme inter-annual sea level rise events along the north-east coast of North America over the 21st century in response to the increase in the greenhouse gas concentration. I have to wonder why it’s taken a relatively long time to establish that this happened. You’re talking about events that started in 2009. Yes, so because during these two years, the ocean circulation changed in the Atlantic Ocean and also the AO index was also very negative. All right, thank you very much. Much to ponder there. Very good to talk to you. Thank you. While we’re on the subject of the American coast- here’s the story of a very unusual rescue mission. A group of manatees, the marine animals sometimes called sea cows, has been saved after becoming stuck in a storm water drain in Florida. Lucas de jong brings you the full story of the rescue. Trapped, cramped and unable to go anywhere. 19 manatees swam into this open storm water pipe in Florida - a pipe big enough to get into but too small to get around in -- to turn around in. As night draws in, the fight for freedom goes on. I thought they were coming in and going out- I didn’t really think anything of it until this. This is terrible. To rescue them all access teams cut up and split open large parts of the pipe. This is a rare situation but, as America’s temperatures drop, the manatees search for warmer water in shallower areas. manatees search for warmer water in shallowerareas. Using shallower areas. Using diggers one by one, they are pulled out and checked. Forthe most by one, they are pulled out and checked. For the most part they’re OK - bruised bumped and bleeding, but alive. After a short drive, the open water waits. but alive. After a short drive, the open waterwaits. (CHEERING) open water waits. (CHEERING) crowds open waterwaits. (CHEERING) crowds cheer as each one is carried down and released. 19 manatees went in - and 19 made it out. Let’sjust take you live now at Stevenville Texas and the court house there and we have had a result from the murder trial of the ex-marine accused of killing the American Sniper author Chris Kyle and another man. We understand that he hasjust been found guilty. I don’t know if we’re going to be listening into this judgement - going to be listening into this judgement- one second. If you please stand, again. Having received an accepted the jury’s verdict in this matter, by statute I will now imposing sentencing in this matter- confinement for life in the Texas department of criminaljustice without the possibility of parole. That’s the verdict of this court and thejudgement accordingly. You may be seated this time again. I will continue as your attorney in this matter with regard to your rights to appeal, and that includes a direct appeal to the Eastland Court of Appeals - that’s the home of the Eleventh Court of Appeals which is the court for this jurisdiction, and also your right to file a discretionary appeal to review with the Court of Appeals in Texas. You will remain in custody to this time why sentence should not be imposed. enterjudgement and remand your custody. The judge there in Stevenville Texas. As you probably gathered, Eddie Ray Ruth has been found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. just to help you with the background here, this, of course, is the murder trial of the ex-Marine Eddie Ray Ruth. He had admitted killing Chris Kyle and his friend in 2013 but he pleaded not guilty. A defence witness testified he suffered from skrits foreign I cannot and was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings. The prosecution said whatever issues he suffered were caused through alcohol and marijuana abuse. Now, let’s take you to something very different indeed, frankly. japan is probably the most earthquake-prepared country in the world. It has systems that automatically shut down gas pipelines when a tremor strikes. It even has a system that can put the brakes onjapan’s high-speed bullet trains within seconds of detecting a shock wave. But what happens if a quake damages a zoo and some of the dangerous animals escape? Well, they have thought of that too. Our correspondent, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, reports from an earthquake exercise at a zoo just outside Tokyo. It is a cold and sunny winter day in Tokyo and families are out enjoying the animals at Tama Zoo. Then, over the loudspeaker, an announcement. From the sleepy tone you might be hard put to tell, but this is a warning. There has, she says, been an earthquake and an animal has escaped. So, the earthquake has apparently damaged some of the cages and at least one wild animal has managed to escape. Apparently it’s coming in this direction. We’ve been told we need to get out of here as soon as we can. Zoo staff are rushing to set up nets to prevent the animal getting any further. Then from around the corner it appears. A man in a catsuit? The zoo staff tries to block him, but the snow leopard attacks. A man is down and the leopards slinks off, looking slightly guilty. A few minutes later he has nearly made it to the zoo’s front gate, but they set up another barrier and this time there is no escape. A dart is fired. The snow leopard stumbles. He’s down. Still, better make sure! To the watching media it has all been great fun. But the man in the suit insists it is supposed to be very realistic. TRANSLATION: I studied how the leopard moves. The most important thing is not to look like the real animal, but to move like the real animal. Still, not everyone is convinced. Was it scary, he asks this little boy. You’re not scary at all, he answers. Of course, it might be a little different if it had been a real earthquake and one of these real big cats was on the loose instead. That’s it for now it shall thanks for watching -- thanks for watching. Good morning our weather is on the turn in the next us 24 hours to something a good deal cloudier and also milder as well. That process starts through Wednesday. We have the mild air out in the Atlantic at the moment, this dome of yellow colour here, this is where the mild air is pushing towards us throughout the day. Now, it it won’t be with all of us today, at least to begin with. You will notice a frost through the night and into the morning across parts of Scotland and north-east England and could get down as low as -5 or -6 to begin with. Contrast that with south-west England - 10 with. Contrast that with south-west England -10 degrees as we start the day. But it is in the milder air where we have the cloud. Outbreaks of rain, light and patchy, certainly in the Palavi Fiu hours but eases off in intensity and it becomes light rain and drizzle across south-west England and parts of Wales. Stilla south-west England and parts of Wales. Still a few splashes of rain to the south and east but already signs of the cloud thinning to the east of the Welsh mountains across parts of the western Scotland Midlands and to the east of the Pennines. It should be frost-free in Northern Ireland, a grey start here, outbreaks of rain and cloud in western Scotland but a dry and bright start for many and, asl said, very cold in some parts of the north-east, with temperatures of -5 and minus six. Now, the cold air will still hold on here throughout the day. Not especially warm. But elsewhere we see the cloud thin and break at times. A bit of sunshine. A lot more cloud than recent days but into the afternoon a good part of Scotland, Northern Ireland and western England and Wales will be predominantly cloudy, outbreaks of rain and drizzle, the heaviest of which across parts of Scotland. Snow on the mountains for a short while and temperatures across some southern and lâl’|'Ipâlâ8lUlââS BCFOSS SOITIE SOUli’IâI’l’I BFEBS southern areas 10-12 degrees. The warm air is really behind this warm front which pushes through well and truly for Wednesday night. Temperatures could hover around 10 degrees for some through the night and into the Thursday morning. Heavier rain, though, on this weather front as it pushes southwards through Thursday, reintroducing colder air. So England and Wales start Thursday cloudy, outbreaks of rain, some of which will be heavy, clears away from the south-east corner into the afternoon and then sunnier weather develops, colder weather and a scattering of showers for Scotland and Northern Ireland, those being a mixture of rain, sleet and also snow. Temperatures through the afternoon, well, probably lower than you start the day, actually. 4-9 degrees at the very best. Hold on to that colder weather as we go into Friday. A lot of dry and bright weather to come on Friday. A few showers scattered around but quite a blustery day. The The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Mike Embley.

Now on BBC News, all the latest business news live from Singapore. A volatile day on Asian markets, as US Federal bank chief janet Yellen urges flexibility over interest rates. A meal, time with friends, or a shower? What would you give up to be able to surf the internet on your mobile phone? Hello, and welcome. You are watching the Wednesday edition of Asia Business Report on BBC World News. I am Rico Hizon. The chair of the US Federal reserve, janet Yellen, has made it clear interest rates in America will not go up until the middle of the year at the earliest. That clarity helped markets rise to record levels in New York overnight. Ms Yellen emphasised the US recovery was on course, though not yet SECUFE. Michelle Fleury reports. If she was feeling under pressure, she didn’t show it. janet Yellen runs the central bank of the world’s largest economy. Her decisions have the power to affect us all. As she began two days of congressional hearings, she was clear- the economy is making progress. Long-term unemployment has declined substantially. Fewer workers are reporting they can find only part-time work, when they would prefer full-time employment. And the pace of quits, often referred to as a barometer of labour market opportunities, has recovered nearly to its prerecession level. But the body that sets interest rates, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is not declaring victory yet. Not with wage growth stunted and muted. The committee considers it unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the target range for the Federal funds rate for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings. Ms Yellen’s remarks were designed to give the central bank flexibility as it comes closer to raising interest rates, in case of risks, including those from abroad. Foreign economies are facing a number of challenges that could restrain economic activity. In China, economic growth could slow more than anticipated. And it wasn’t just lawmakers listening closely - on Wall Street, investors liked what they heard. Stocks closed at fresh highs. janet Yellen used her first day of testimony to provide greater clarity on the timing of the first interest rate hike. Most investors here on Wall Street still think that such a move is likely in june or September. But whenever America’s central bank does increase interest rates in the world’s largest economy, it will be the world’s first such increase since 2006. In other market-moving headlines, the European Finance Commissioner says an immediate financial crisis has been averted by the eurozone’s approval of changer to Greece’s bailout pI’OgI’8lTIl’|'Iâ. The measures offered by Greece include combating tax evasion and reforming the public sector in exchange for a four-month extension of its bailout. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturing seems to be edging up to That is according to a private survey. The Purchasing Managers Index or PMI reached 50.1 for the month, a fraction above the 50-point level, which separates growth and activity in a contraction. Asian markets are reacting with volatility to those developments, as investors digest the PMI numbers from China and janet Yellen’s statement on interest rates. Currently you have the measure indices in Asia in positive territory -- indices. Including in Hong Kong. As we go to air, the finance chief is in parliament delivering the budget for the territory. Residents are struggling on low wages hope housing, old age benefits and education are on the agenda. The business community wants tax incentives. For the latest, let’s cross the Hong Kong and speak with Peter Church house. So far, what we have heard is cash put into peoples pockets in an effort to boost consumption -- Churchouse -- people’s. That’s right. There are three areas they are doing that. Firstly, incentives to cut fees for the tourism industry. Secondly, rebates for citizens on public housing rents and rates. Thirdly, increasing the child benefit allowance quite dramatically. And increasing old age payments significantly as well. Three areas I would think putting money in people’s pockets. What else would you like to see from this budget? I think what I would like to see is more comprehensive proposals to plan for the long-term retirement system in Hong Kong. And secondly, I would also like to see some fundamental reforms to the tax regime. And thirdly, I would like to see some serious proposals on improving and lowering the cost of housing and increasing the supply of housing in Hong Kong. If we look at the economic forecast for 2015 it is wide-ranging, from 1-3%. In 2014, a slowdown impacted by the Chinese economy. That’s correct, and, let’s face it, China hasn’t been great with forecasting in the past for economic growth or its own budget surpluses and deficits. I think he is forecasting a significant slowdown in the coming year - lowering the lower bound of the forecast to 1% GDP growth. The upper bound at 3%. My own feeling is we will more likely be in the 1-2% and in the 3% range, given the slowdown we are seeing in the global economy and also in the Chinese economy. Peter Churchouse, thank you so much for your insights on the Hong Kong budget for 2015 - he joined us from our Hong Kong’s studios. How attached are you to your smartphone? For many of us, being online all the time is now as familiar as taking a shower or eating Breakfast. ~ -- breakfast. But what would you be willing to give up for a mobile internet connection? Well, that question was part of a study which we will hear more about in a minute. But first, let’s hear how people see this in Singapore answered. I use my phone very frequently. I could give up a meal a day for it. Yes. If there is one thing I have to give up to use my internet on my phone, that would be meeting my friends. I would give up having internet to be able to shower, because that is important to me. No, I definitely wouldn’t give up showering. Personal hygiene is very important to me. I use my phone in the shower though, because I listen to the radio while I shower. I wouldn’t give up internet for showering. I mean, I have to shower every day. I would give up anything. I need it. I can’t live without it. Whatever you yourself would have answered, there is no doubt that mobile internet is a rapidly growing market. Revenue in the top five Asia-Pacific countries - Australia, China, India, japan, South Korea - stands at 300 billion US dollars, more than the US and than twice the 5 biggest European countries combined. ~ -- five. By 2017, revenue is expected to more than double to $622 billion. Philip Hammond spoke to a representative from the Boston consulting group which is behind the study and asked him which market is growing the fastest in Asia. The fastest-growing is India, and India is growing from a very low base, but the forecast is that the mobile internet will triple between today and 2017, in size. The biggest is China. Which at $1.45 billion of revenue today is already the biggest in Asia. It is actually bigger than the US market, and also bigger than the European five. So, it actually represent a very, very big mobile internet market already. And that is forecast to more than double in the next three years. Now what did this mean for companies in that region and how they go about their strategies? So, for companies operating in the region, I think there are couple of big take aways. One of them is that as a go to market avenue, the mobile internet represents a tremendous opportunity to connect with your customer. So, figuring out the best way to do that, whether you are an online retailer or whether you are a newspaper, whatever business you are in, figuring out how to use the mobile internet is in order to maintain their access to the mobile internet. Some of those answers are quite interesting. Well, we found some very surprising answers. In China, 30% of people said they would be willing to give up both sex and showering, rather than giving up the mobile internet. And similarly in South Korea, it was 30% of people willing to give up sex and 20% showering. So, I think people are fairly attached to their phones. Let’s have a quick recap of the markets - we have seen most of them rising in midday trading due to janet Yellen’s statement that it could be months but for the Fed hikes interest rates. There is the Chinese PMI survey coming in better than expected. Thank you for investing your time with us. I am Rico Hizon, bye for now. ~ Iam Mike I am Mike Embley in London with the main news stories this hour. The top stories this hour: Islamic State militants have abducted 150 from a Syrian Christian villages in north-eastern Syria where there has been fighting with Kurdish forces -- Assyrian. The leader of the Green Party, Natalie Bennett, has apologised to colleagues for what she called an excruciating’ performance in a radio interview about the party’s election priorities. She struggled to answer questions about the Greens’ plans to build 500,000 new homes. Our political correspondent Vicki Young reports. We’ve all had them, the kind of days which start with high hopes and expectations, but end up being, well, ones you’d rather forget. For Natalie Bennett, this was a chance to showcase the Green Party’s best policies. This is going to be our biggest, boldest campaign ever. Politicians need to have facts at their finger tips. Instead, Ms Bennett had what she described as ""an excruciating mental brain fade"", as she struggled to explain the party’s policy on housing during a radio interview. Right, what we’re looking at, in terms of the figures here. Yeah. What we need to do is actually... Ah... We’re looking at a total spend of £2.7 billion. But what is the total cost of 500,000 homes? Um... It’s about a cost of £60,000 per home. How are you going to pay for the land? Right, well what we’re looking at doing is... Is, basically... COUGHING. Are you alright? Sorry, yes. As you can probably hear, I’ve got a huge cold. I’m terribly sorry to hear that. Yeah. Later she told me she hadn’t been at her best. I didn’t do a greatjob this morning, I had a brain fade. That happens. What I’m aiming to do is to face up to that and then move on. Natalie Bennett’s cold may explain today’s performance, but she has been under fire before for giving vague answers. How can you hope to raise £45 billion... People are very welcome to have a look at the Green Party website and see how the figures are worked out. You would make it legal for people living here to be a member of Al-Qaeda or ISIS or the IRA. You’d make it legal to be a member of a terrorist organisation, correct? Exactly. What we want to do is make sure we’re not punishing people for what they think, for what they believe. The Greens are enjoying a surge in popularity, and with that comes greater scrutiny. And you’d expect a party leader to be across policy details. For those who’ve turned to the party in recent months, looking for an alternative to the main Westminster parties, well maybe they won’t care too much about a couple of bad interviews.

Coming up on this programme: Advantage Barcelona - Luis Suarez puts Manchester City to the sword in the Champions League. Davis Love III has been named the next US Ryder Cup captain to take on Europe at Hazeltine next year. And world number three Andy Murray is through to the second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships. Hello, thanks forjoining us. We’re going to kick off with the first leg of the Champions League last 16 ties, where Barcelona have beaten Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad courtesy of a Luis Suarez brace. Sergio Aguero was on target for the home side. Earlier on, I spoke to our football correspondent, john Bennett, for his take on the match in Manchester. Barcelona were a class above in the first half, and their star man was Luis Suarez - his first game back in England since leaving English football, since leaving Liverpool to join Barcelona. He has had a mixed start to his career at the Camp Nou, but look at this stat- 21 goals he He has had a mixed start to his career at the Camp Nou, but look at this stat- 21 goals he has been involved in in his first 23 Barcelona games. He scored nine, the rest were assists. Two excellent finishes as well, and Manchester City were completely played off the park in the first 45 minutes. gave them hope in the tie and perhaps the comeback was on. They came back Bayern Munich earlier in the season - were they going to come back against Barcelona? Not this time, as they received a bookable offence from a ridiculous challenge. Then drama right at the end - Lionel Messi won a penalty. Zabaleta with the foul, Messi steps up - surely it’s going to be 3-1? No! The save is made, rebounds back to Lionel Messi, he has an open goal and a diving header and it goes wide. So an unbelievable game. Should have been 3-1 to Barca. So perhaps Manchester City will see themselves as fortunate that it was only 2-1. It was a very important save. I think the must control our emotions. We had more chances to try and win. It was very difficult. There we can see confirmation of that result. In the other Tuesday night tie, Serie A champions juventus beat Bundesliga strugglers Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at home. Goals from Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata for the Italians and Marco Reus on the scoresheet with what could prove to be a crucial away goal for Dortmund. Monaco will take on Arsenal in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie at the Emirates Stadium in London on Wednesday. That’s after the French side reached the knockout stages for the first time in ten years. It’s a club that Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger knows well, the Ligue 1 side giving the Frenchman his big break in management in the late 1980s. just to warn you, Ben Smith’s report does contain some flash photography. Arsene, who read the headline when the Frenchman arrived at Arsenal in 1996. Well, nearly 20 years later, he is Arsenal’s longest-serving manager and their most successful. But this journey to north London began in the south of France. It’s the start of my career and I didn’t know how long I would be in thejob and where I would be, you know? And it’s my first chance to be in a big club. I was very young and you are always grateful for that. On the Cote did’ Azur he is revered for the games he won and the young French superstars he ushered in. As a coach he commanded respect. You can see the personality and strong character he has got. He is a gaffer who knows exactly what he wants. He really brought the club to a different level. When he was the gaffer here. The calm waters hee belie turbulent time for the Principalities Football Club. Since Wenger left, 16 managers have come and gone as the club went from a Champions League final to the brink of France’s third tier. The club’s famous stadium is here in Monaco where one in three of the 36,000 residents are millionaires. Russian money has renewed their hopes. The last year they invested a lot with players. This will be an emotional first reunion for Wenger and Monaco. But, come kick-off, there will be no room for sentiment. Monaco have experience of playing English sides. They’ve done it ten times in Europe, winning five and losing two, but this is their first competitive game against Arsenal. Dimitar Berbatov is a player who knows a thing or two about the Premier League, having spent time with Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Fulham. He thinks Arsenal are the favourites. We know it is going to be a difficult game. We are the underdog in this game. Arsenal are the favourite. But we came for good results. Hopefully we can achieve it. We have prepared well for the game. I told it. We have prepared well for the game. Itold my game. I told my teammates and they know it is going to be a tough game. Now news from the English Premier League - Chelsea say they’re extemely disappointed and called for more player protection, after the FA’s decision to only reduce Nemanja Matic’s suspension from three games to two, following an appeal. Matic picked up a straight red in Saturday’s 1-all draw with Burnley, after he retaliated against Ashley Barnes for a challenge, which Barnes was cleared for. Chelsea maintain the Serb was unjustly punished for what they say was a career-threatening tackle. It means Matic will miss Sunday’s Capitol One Cup Final against Spurs at Wembley. The PGA of America has announced that Davis Love will captain the United States Ryder Cup team at Hazeltine next year. The 1997 US PGA Champion skippered the American side in 2012 when the USA threw away a 10-4 lead on Sunday afternoon to lose to Europe in what became known as ""The miracle at Medinah"". This group is about a team winning. We’re building a team of captains. We are building a family that’s going to pull together. We’re like a football team, like a basketball team - like Dean Smith’s teams that always brought back the players in the summer and taught the younger players how to play. A lot of respect and a lot of love with that, and that passion will come out and we’ll have a lot more fun. We’ll give ourselves a better chance to succeed. World number three Andy Murray is through to the second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships after a straight sets victory over hold serve in the third game of the first set. Murray eventually Next up, he will play world number 50, joao Sousa. And fourth-seeded Tomas Berdych, a finalist at Dubai the last two years, saw off the challenge of France’sjeremy Chardy in straight sets 7-6, 6-4. That win the Czech’s 499th of his career. Later on Tuesday, the top seed Novak Djokovic also won his first round match. He beat Vasek Pospisil in straight sets 6-4, 6-4. Defending MotoGP champion Marc Marquez returned to the top of the pre-season testing timesheets at the Sepang circuit in Malaysia on Tuesday. On the second day of the penultimate test before the season begins, the Spanish Repsol-Honda rider set the pace. Marquez was one of only two riders to break the two minute mark as he claimed the top spot. I’m happy because, you know, the problem from yesterday has gone, and that is important, and we start to try a few things and, you know, we didn’t have time to try everything, so tomorrow we will continue. Maybe I will not have time to do the long run - we will see. But the priority and the most important is finishing this test with everything clear for Honda. Now to rugby union. Wales have made four changes to their 6 Nations side to face France on Saturday. Coach Warren Gatland welcomes back George North, after the winger suffered concussion in Wales’ defeat to England. Samson Lee, Luke Charteris and Scott Baldwin have also been drafted into the starting 15. Wales head to Paris looking to repeat their win from 2013 and captain Sam Warburton says these are the games every player lives for. I would much rather a game like this against France where it is a must-win game compared to playing, you know, a tier three or tier four nation at home where you are expected to win by 15 points. It’s much more exciting - there’s a lot more tension on the training ground and a little bit of - it’s a good energy. It is a much more enjoyable test to be involved in. It is really exciting as players to have a game like this coming up on the weekend, against a top team, away from home as well. It is a massive challenge but it is one which you really enjoy playing in. You can get all the latest sports news at our website - that’s bbc.com/sport.

I’m Mike Embley. Our top stories: A former US Marine is convicted of the killing of American Sniper author Chris Kyle. The BBC tracks the three London schoolgirls who’ve crossed into Syria to join Islamic State. Two bombings in northern Nigeria kill at least 27, but the President says the tide has turned in the fight against Boko Haram militants. The UK becomes the first country approving laws allowing the A former Marine has been found guilty of the murder of US Navy Seal Chris Kyle, who wrote American Sniper, and B SâCol’Id ITIBFI, ata -i-EXBS QUIT FBFIQE. Eddie Ray Routh was sentenced him to life in prison without parole. His defence lawyers had claimed he was psychotic at the time of the shootings two years ago. But prosecutors said Routh was aware of what he was doing when he gunned the pair down in 2013. Our correspondent, Alastair Leithead, is in Los Angeles and joins us now. Help us with the background to all of this. This was a couple of years ago in a shooting range in Texas. Chris Kyle, very well-known the US and around the world, as American Sniper, the blockbuster movie out at the moment is based on his autobiography. And then with more confirmed kills than anyone else in the US military. He was working with people suffering from PTSD, calling the gun ranges, talking about his experiences. On this occasion he went with a friend, capital field, and they took Eddie Ray Routh to the shooting range and at that point, after Chris Kyle emptied his rounds from his weapon, the men were both killed at close range with a multiple number of bullets, and then the man went away from them. There was no doubt this happen. The question was whether or not Eddie Ray Routh was insane. That was his defence in pleading not guilty. The iury defence in pleading not guilty. The jury tookjust two defence in pleading not guilty. The jury took just two hours after the summing up of a case to find him guilty of murderand summing up of a case to find him guilty of murder and he has then been told he will spend the rest of life in jail without parole. been told he will spend the rest of life injail without parole. This has been about the psychological impact of conflict, hasn’t it? Of course, it was something Chris Kyle dealt with. He was reaching out to veterans as part of his way of helping them recover. Hundreds of thousands of troops who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq suffer from returned from Afghanistan and Iraq sufferfrom PTSD in this returned from Afghanistan and Iraq suffer from PTSD in this country. The prosecutors allege this was not insanity. It was just cold, calculated capital murder, which is of course what the jury decided it was - they supported what the prosecutor said. was - they supported what the prosecutorsaid. His prosecutor said. His defence lawyers said he was a paranoid schizophrenic and shouldn’t be jailed for this and they will be appealing. Enormous attention paid to the trial, partly because of the story, partly because of the film - this is a big deal. It is, yes, Clint Eastwood directed this film, American Sniper, which was nominated for Oscars. It won an Oscar at the weekend. As I said, it was based on his, Chris Kyle’s biography. Someone who was certainly a war hero before that. Unmistakably as a result of this film. Huge attention in the US to this case which has been going on for the last couple of weeks - it has been televised. Thank you very much. Let’s take a look at the moment the verdict was read out. Thejury The jury has returned to the courtroom at this time. I have been advised the jury has reached a verdict, is this correct? And perform to the Bailiff, please, Mammon -- hand -- ma’am. Mr Routh, Week, thejury, find the defendant, Eddi Ray Routh, guilty of B felony of capital murder. The verdict is signed by thejury -- the of capital murder. The verdict is signed by the jury -- the felony. You may be seated at this time. The verdict from Texas. The BBC has learnt that the three missing schoolgirls from East London crossed into Syria about five days ago. British counter terrorism police have also confirmed they believe the girls - Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase are already in Syria. It’s feared they’re under the control of the extremist group, Islamic State. They travelled to Istanbul in Turkey a week ago. Sources inside Syria have told the BBC the girls crossed near the Kilis border crossing. It’s believed they were helped by people smugglers. Our correspondent, james Reynolds, has the details from Istanbul. Tonight, it seems clear that schoolgirls Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase have made it through Turkey, and into Syria. Contacts tell the BBC that the three are with a smuggler affiliated to the so-called Islamic State. The three flew out of Gatwick a week ago, during half-term. Amira had told her father that she was going to a wedding. Sources tell us that the three girls, and the smugglers, prepared for the crossing near Kilis on the Turkey-Syria border. The smugglers claim that they got the girls into Syria four or five days ago. The girls covered their faces, and the smugglers managed to avoid Turkish surveillance, focussed on other crossings much closer to IS- held territory. The British police say that they told Turkey about the girls within a day. But Turkey insists that the UK didn’t move quickly enough. TRANSLATION: A country such as Britain, which is famous for Scotland Yard, has not closely followed these three girls despite there being concerns about them. We were informed three days after they left Heathrow and came to Istanbul. No-one stops you, or even notices you, when you leave Istanbul’s main airport. We don’t yet know exactly where the girls headed after this. But Istanbul’s bus station provides a simple and discreet route down to the border. It is incredibly easy to get the bus from Istanbul all the way to the border with Syria. A ticket only costs about £20, and the journey takes about 14 hours. One to Gaziantep. Do I have to show you my passport? No passport, OK. So you can buy a ticket to Gaziantep and you don’t have to show yOUlâ p8SSpoI’l. All you need is money. One former Turkish diplomat tells us that it is now time for his country to take a clear step. We should close the borders, that I believe, if we can. Because we don’t have any relations with Syria. No diplomatic relations. We don’t have an embassy there. We don’t have any official representative there. And we discourage our own people to go there. The British authorities represented here at the consulate say that they will continue to work with their Turkish counterparts. But it is hard to see what, if anything, either government can now realistically do. Inside Syria, the three schoolgirls are out of reach. james Reynolds, BBC News, Istanbul. The Christian men, women and children believed to have been abducted by Islamic State militants on Tuesday in Syria are still missing. At least 70 people were taken in dawn raids, but the figures could be higher still, with one group putting the number at 150. The kidnappings took place in the northeast of the country, after the militants seized villages from Kurdish forces in the Hassakah province, near the cities of Tal Tamr and Hassakah. The abducted people are thought to be members of the Assyrian Christian minority. Christians are believed to have constituted about 10% of Syria’s 22 million people before uprising began, four years ago. Of those, 40,000 are Assyrians. They’ve been based in the region for centuries, but their numbers have fallen dramatically recently because of persecution. The largest concentration of Assyrians in Syria is in Hassakeh province, but there are also smaller communities in Aleppo, Homs and Damascus. I spoke tojoshua Landis, Director of the University of Oklahoma’s Centre for Middle East Studies. He gave us more details on the situation on the ground. This entire front, under Assyrian, this provides a frontier between the Kurdish province of Hassakeh and ISIS controlled territory below it -- Hassakeh. Fora long ISIS controlled territory below it -- Hassakeh. For a long time those villagers were left alone. There were ISIS incursions into the territory. Some people were told to take their crosses off their churches. As the situation heated up, and on Sunday, the US bombed about eight strikes near the territory, helping the Kurdish Peshmerga move south, these Christians got wrought into the fight -- Christians got wrought into the fight-- brought. They have into this militia against ISIS. real value. Christians are valuable to the West and they have now taken notice. Christians are vulnerable targets - what will likely happen to these people? That’s a good question - some people speculate there might be a trade in prisoners because there are quite a few ISIS prisoners taken by the Kurds. On the other hand, we haven’t seen trades go on in the past like this, especially with high-value Christians, that will be an international spotlight. More likely, when we saw with the japanese, they ask 200 million. The same amount of the japanese gave the Iraq to fight ISIS. -- gave the eruption is the same with America and thejordanians. -- gave the accrued Iraq. and thejordanians. -- gave the Iraq. jordan, the US, lined up against them. That might be the case, hopefully not, with these Christians. Nigerian President Goodluck jonathan says the tide has turned in the fight against Boko Haram. He said Nigeria’s army and allies were making rapid progress in recovering territory seized by the Islamist group in the north-east. But his comments came after twenty-seven people were killed in two suicide bomb attacks on bus stations. The blasts occurred in Kano, the largest city in the north, and in the town of Potiskum. Laura Westbrook reports. This is the aftermath of another suicide bomb attack in Nigeria, the result of a strike on a major bus station in the northern city of Kano. It seems that the two bombers came as passengers from outside the city, so they came in, were driven in as passengers, in the process of moving out. After arriving at the motor park, that was the time they decided to detonate the bomb. A witness there describes the attack. TRANSLATION: I am a union member. I came here to collect my union fees. I saw the two guys, and the way they looked, I did not trust them. But I did not pay attention since I don’t work here. After I reached the branch office, I suddenly heard the blast, and saw many people on fire. This was the second strike in a day. just hours earlier there was a blast in the town of Potiskum. A witness said a bomber blew himself up while trying to board a bus. Nigeria’s President Goodluck jonathan blamed Boko Haram for the attacks. He said this. Nigeria’s president blamed them. He said this. These military exercises were held in Chad over the weekend, to prepare a joint task force to fight the Islamist militants. More than 10,000 people were killed by Boko Haram last year. The tide may be turning. What is clear though is this is going to be a long, hard fight. The United Kingdom has become the first country in the world to legalise the creation of IVF babies using DNA from three people, following a vote at the House of Lords. It means some women who carry inherited diseases will now be able to have healthy children. The fertility regulator is to decide how to license the procedure. Our health reporter, james Gallagher, explains how it might work. It isa It is a modified version of IVF. Instead of using sperm from one man and a egg from a woman mother is another egg involved. The reason we try to do this is because inside a woman’s egg is mitochondria - it turns food into energy that cells can use. In some women, this might appropriate isn’t effective, so they use the egg from the donor with all of the parent’s genetic information. The healthy mitochondria comes from the donor and the healthy DNA from the parent. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come: How many manatees can you fit in a storm drain? It isn’t a joke but it does have a happy ending. First, the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The South China Morning Post leads with possible changes to Hong Kong’s election law for the 2022 choice of chief executive. Proposals include expanding the electoral college. China’s mega-rich are watching the yuan as it weakens against the dollar. Financial authorities are trying to ensure the rich keep their money in China.

And in the International New York Times, the unveiling of the new 20-euro bill which has transparent hologram technology, intended to defeat counterfeiters. This is BBC News. The latest headlines. A former US Marine has been convicted in the deaths of American Sniper author Chris Kyle and Kyle’s friend at a shooting range two years ago. British police say they’ve received information that three London schoolgirls who disappeared last week have made their way to Syria. Staying with that story - and trying to fight the pull that extremism can have on teenagers is something authorities still need to tackle. By leaving you are kind of saying, ""I don’t believe in God’s power, I You are saying, ""I’m going to take action and go out there and do something"", but what can you do if you are 15 years old and in secondary school? I was shocked at first and I was really disappointed as well. This girl told me she knew a girl who had attended a north London mosque who had felt driven to take up jihad. She felt like she couldn’t be British and a Muslim at the same time. She felt this place wasn’t home for her. She used to wear a veil and every time she went out people would point at her and make silly comments about her face and everything, so she had enough of this country. And I think she was easily, easily influenced by other people. The first new edition of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in more than a month goes on sale on Wednesday. It’s only the second time it’s been published since an attack in january that killed 12 of its staff. The front page features depictions of figures such as the Pope and former president Nicolas Sarkozy chasing a dog with the magazine in its mouth, and the words ‘Here We Go Again’. The print run of 2.5 million is ten times higher than before the attack, that was carried out by two Islamist gunmen in Paris. Eight people have been shot dead by a gunman at a restaurant in the Czech Republic. The gunman later turned the gun on himself. A ninth victim, believed to be a waitress, suffered chest wounds and is in a serious condition in hospital. Rob Cameron has this report from Prague. Armed police surround this pub - popular with locals, it’s now a crime scene. It’s reported each victim was shot in the head - the gunman a local man in his early 60s. He was carrying two pistols. Neighbours said he was mentally unstable. TRANSLATION: Police were under fire from the offender and closed off the area. When the operation unit came in, the offender committed suicide. Police made it impossible for the offender to leave the building and move with two loaded guns around the town. So, what more do we know about him? A TV station came forward saying he had called them minutes beforehand. He told them to send a news team to the scene - he said he was being bullied and persecuted. He promised revenge. Police now say his victims were already dead by the time he made that call. Officials confirm the man was unemployed, had no criminal record and owned a gun licence. Guns are not uncommon here - hunting is a popular hobby. But gun crime is rare - this is the worst mass shooting in the country’s history. A massive clean-up operation is under way in California where a commuter train slammed into a truck which had been abandoned on the tracks. Three carriages were sent tumbling onto their sides when the accident happened about 120 kilometres outside of Los Angeles. 28 people were injured. The BBC’s David Willis has more. The sprawling wreckage of an early-morning commuter train bound for Los Angeles, after it collided with a lorry left abandoned on the track. Amateur video, taken minutes after the crash, shows a giant fireball and the vehicle engulfed by flames. The collision split the scorched vehicle in two, and catapulted part of it several yards down the line. The lights went out, and itjust seemed like slow motion, seemed like it took forever. We were doing about 60 mph. The gates were down. Engineer definitely used the brake, had his emergency brake set. We were slowing down as we hit them. 28 were taken to hospital- some suffering head and spinal injuries. Among of those who escaped injury was the lorry driver. He is currently helping police with their enquiries, but it seems he may simply have taken a wrong turn. One of our patrol officers saw what he believed to be a disoriented male walking approximately 1-2 miles south of the accident scene on Rice Avenue. He was not injured in the incident, however, he was taken to a local hospital for observation and treatment. As rescue workers search for trapped passengers, the entire LA area metrolink commuter system was shut down. A federal investigation into the crash is now under way. It means possession would not result. President Obama has vetoed a Republican backed bill which would have approved the Keystone XL oil pipeline. First proposed more than six years ago - the pipeline would connect Canada’s tar sands to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. But the White House said the congressional move circumvented the long standing process for evaluating the project. It is just the third veto of Obama’s presidency. While we’re on the subject of the American coast, here’s the story of a very unusual rescue mission. A group of manatees, the marine animals sometimes called sea cows, has been saved after becoming stuck in a storm water drain in Florida. Lucas de jong brings you the full story of the rescue. Trapped, cramped and unable to go anywhere. 19 manatees swam into this open stormwater pipe in Florida - a pipe big enough to get into but too small to to turn around in. As night draws in, the fight for freedom goes on. I thought they were coming in and going out - I didn’t really Using diggers, one by one they are pulled out and checked. For the most part they’re OK - bruised, bumped and bleeding, but alive. After a short drive, the open water waits. (CHEERING) Crowds cheer as each one is carried down and released. 19 manatees went in - and 19 made it out. japan is probably the most earthquake prepared country in the world. But what happens if a quake damages a zoo and dangerous animals escape? Well they have thought of that - Rupert Wingfield-Hayes reports from an earthquake exercise at a zoo just outside Tokyo. It is a cold and sunny winter day in Tokyo and families are out enjoying the animals at Tama Zoo. Then, over the loudspeaker, an announcement. From the sleepy tone you might be hard put to tell, but this is a warning. There has, she says, been an earthquake and an animal has escaped. So, the earthquake has apparently damaged some of the cages and at least one wild animal has managed to escape. Apparently it’s coming in this direction. We’ve been told we need to get out of here as soon as we can. Zoo staff are rushing to set up nets to prevent the animal getting any further. Then from around the corner it appears. A man in a catsuit? The zoo staff tries to block him, but the snow leopard attacks. A man is down and the leopards slinks off, looking slightly guilty. A few minutes later he has nearly made it to the zoo’s front gate, but they set up another barrier and this time there is no escape. A dart is fired. The snow leopard stumbles. He’s down. Still, better make sure! To the watching media it has all been great fun. But the man in the suit insists it is supposed to be very realistic. TRANSLATION: Istudied how the leopard moves. The most important thing is not to look like the real animal, but to move like the real animal. Still, not everyone is convinced. Was it scary, he asks this little boy. You’re not scary at all, he answers. Of course, it might be a little different if it had been a real earthquake and one of these real big cats was on the loose instead.

A former US marine has been found guilty of the murder of Chris Kyle, whose life story was made into the film, American Sniper. Eddie Ray Routh had been taken to a shooting range by Kyle in an effort to help him cope with symptoms of post-traumatic stress brought on by his military service in Iraq. British police says they’ve received information that three London schoolgirls missing from their homes since last week have successfully made their way to Syria to join Islamic State. The BBC understands that the girls were smuggled across the border from Turkey four or five days ago. At least 27 people have been killed in two suicide bombings in northern Nigeria. However, the country’s president, Goodluckjonathan, has claimed the tide has turned in the fight against the Boko Haram Islamist militants. He said rapid progress was being made in recovering territory seized by the group in the north-east. Now on BBC News, it’s time for HARDtalk. Welcome to HARDtalk. I’m Stephen Sackur. Draw up a list of the greatest living filmmakers, and my guest today would surely occupy a prominent place. Werner Herzog is reponsible for some of the most wildly beautiful images captured on celluloid. If you have seen Fitzcarraldo, you won’t have forgotten the steamship being hauled over a mountain. He is seen as the film industry’s obsessive genius, the director who once threatened to shoot his lead actor to prevent him quitting. After five decades making movies, is Werner Herzog’s love of film as intense as ever? Werner Herzog, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you. Let’s start with the word ""passion"". You have been making films for the best part of five decades. Does your passion for film burn as bright as ever? It hasn’t stopped. There is some sort of a fire within, and in a way, I can say I haven’t had a career. Because career means planning, and ""what do I do after that step?"" It is always, I keep saying, it is like burglars in your kitchen in the middle of the night. You wake up at 3:00am in the morning, and something stirs, and there are five burglars. And the one who carries the most vehemence at you, with an axe in his hand, ora knife ora gun, so you have to deal with that one first. And that is how my film projects are coming at me. And I have, in recent years, I have made more films. And just counting them, which is silly. We have made more films than before, and some of them bigger. You mentioned Fitzcarraldo, I am just releasing now a big, epic film, which was shot in the desert in Morocco. Queen of the Desert, with Nicole Kidman. I have done documentaries, but I have done other things, which are overlooked quite often. I have written books, and I have a suspicion that my prose may outlive my films, like Conquest of the Useless, or Of Walking In Ice. I have run my own film school. I am going to stop you there, because there is so much... And acting as a villain... I will stop it. I will get to the acting as a villain later on too. Even the list you have just given me of the artistic endeavours you are still undertaking, so many of them, I am just wondering whether your style has changed? Do you think - there is this word ""mellowed,"" and people often attach it to age. Do you think you have mellowed, as an artist, with age? It doesn’t look likely. Because if you look at the films I have made just a few years ago, Bad Lieutenant, people think I am this possessed filmmaker who has not an ounce of humour in all my films. There is humour, including Fitzcarraldo, including the instance when I came close to shooting my leading actor, or Grisly Man. There is an intensity which has not been there before. You have also mentioned, you have started teaching young filmmakers. And I wonder - imagine I am one of your young students, -- listening to Werner Herzog’s view If there are just a few words that you could give to a student like me, as to what matters most for successfully making a good movie, what would you say? I think self-reliance. Everybody is complaining how the industry is stupid, they cannot get the money together. And so I say roll up your sleeves, work as a bouncer in a sex club, in a lunatic asylum, half the year. You earn ten or $20,000, and you can make a feature film today. There is no excuse anymore. And then, of course, read, read, read, read, read. If you don’t read, you will never make a great film. And I do have mandatory reading lists, but it has nothing to do with cinema. It has to do with poetry, beginning in antiquity, in Rome, Virgil, Georgics, about life in the country. Old Nordic poetry, even the commission report on the assassination of Kennedy. It is mandatory. So a broad mind matters? Yes, conceptual thinking. And those who are ready to break the rules, who are ready to learn from me how to pick a safety lock, how to forge a document. You see a film like Fitzcarraldo would never be possible without massive forgery. At the time Peru was a dictatorship. All of a sudden, along the river, I had to move my ship. I was stopped, shot at. And I demanded an explanation, and I didn’t get an explanation. I was only told, ""Where is your shooting permit?"" And I said - of course, I made it up - ""It is in Lima, and it will ""take me three or four days until I can bring it to thejungle."" So, four days later I come with a very elaborate, beautiful document, written in antiquated chancellery sort of diction, in Spanish, on notary paper, and it says the El Presidente de la Republica, the President of the Republic. It allowed me literally... And a complete fake. A complete fa ke. It was signed by the President of the Republic, stamped, the Notary of the President signed it as well. And the Interior Minister signed it. So, then I said, ""You let me pass now?"" And he looks at me, and looks at the document, and salutes and says pass on. So, rule-breaking is a part of the recipe for successful filmmakers? Yes. And you have constantly, through your career, focused on this word ""courage."" And you have juxtaposed courage against cowardice in the way you go about making a film. But what I want to push you on, you mentioned Fitzcarraldo, is that you can take courage to an insane extent. You can push your crew, your actors, the people around you, to the point where they are putting their lives on the line. And many would say you did that with Fitzcarraldo. I did that with my life, with no-one else’s. That is a myth which has been created. But let’s put it into normal terms. Yes, I have done films that nobody else would have done. How do you move a very, heavy steel boat over a mountain, with the help of 1,100 ""savage,"" in movie terms, native Indians? But it was not insanity, because I knew I could move it over the mountain. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I have read, and maybe it was folklore, that one of your cinematographers had his hand smashed when filming the steamship, when he was going over the rapids. Another was bitten by a deadly snake, and lost part of his leg. Chopped off with a chainsaw, because it was one of our lumber men, who worked barefoot, cutting trees for moving the ship over the clear part, strip of the forest. He was bitten by the most venomous snake in the world. And you have something like, very few seconds to make up your mind what to do. Our doctor and our medical camp was too far away for reaching it within minutes. It was something like 20 minutes away. So he picked up the chainsaw that had stopped, and started it up again, like an outboard engine of a boat. And just looked at it, and chops off his foot. Oh my God. And survived. No movie is, surely, worth that sort of trauma. It is not, and when you do a film, you have to be very, very careful that these things are not happening. But things happen when you build a bridge, for example. Yes, you have accidents. But none of them was directly related to the shooting of the film. There were extreme precautions. For example, some of the hoses snapped, and when that happens there is some sort of a whiplash effect, that can decapitate one or several persons. So when we moved the ship, there was, far and wide, nobody around. I was around, nobody else. Well, when you talk of extremes, and things snapping, another thing that famously snapped on one of your sets was your own temper, with your good friend and lead at that time in some of your most famous films, Klaus around the first bend of the river. And I am just wondering whether, actually, that was entirely facetious, or whether there was a part of Werner Herzog that could imagine shooting an actor? I have never done it, and the funny thing is that both of us simultaneously plotted to murder each other, with beautiful plots. Like great screenplays of detective and crime stories, we plotted. But in this case, well, I was unarmed. I didn’t have a rifle in my hand. However, I had confiscated his Winchester, a really serious Winchester, a few nights before. He had a hut a little bit higher than the extras and, you have to imagine, a thatched roof. And the extras, 45 of them, are laughing in this hut after shooting. And they are playing cards, and Klaus Kinski has a tantrum. These people are laughing. And all of a sudden, nobody knew what got into him, he shot through, he fired three shots through the hut, through the walls. That he didn’t kill anyone was a miracle. He only shot the middle finger away from one of the extras. That is when I had to confiscate the rifle, and I had it. Did you? Honestly, now, it is many years later, did you ever consider going to get that rifle and pointing it at him? That is hard to say in retrospect, I find it very funny. I find it very funny, it is a hilarious incident. There was a grain of seriousness about it, and he realised, he realised there was a task there that was beyond him and beyond me. We had to fulfil a duty which was way beyond us. So in light of it, we laughed and talked and drank champagne over all of this. And you see, you have to - I think the important thing is how do you walk away from such a thing? Ten minutes later. You did. We walked away from it and embraced and laughed, and laughed until the end of history. And of course, that movie, like so many of your best-known films, was set in an extreme environment. A very harsh environment. And that seems to me to be a theme of your work. Notjust in your movies, your fictional films, but also in your documentary work. You love pushing yourself, and featuring subjects who are pushing themselves, to the very limit in terms of their relationship with the natural world. Only if they are willing to do this. You see, I would never force anyone. That is a myth that I am pushing people to the brink of what they can do, to their physical existence. Yes, when you are shooting in rapids, we saw the ship going through the rapids, there was nobody on board. It looked spectacular, and then it didn’t look that dangerous. And we said, let’s be onboard the ship with cameras. So whoever wants to, under that free will, come with me. And one of us had this camera on his shoulder, and flew through the air and smashed down on the deck, with the camera in his hand, which was something like 20 kg, and its split his hand apart. Yes, this happens. But I suppose. .. And he never minded. He never minded. That was part of a bigger deal. Yes, we do risk certain things, but we do not impose it on anyone else. I suppose I am also thinking in the context of a more recent documentary film you made, Grizzly Man, which took the home movie material filmed by the extraordinary figure, Timothy Treadwell, who lived for years in a remote part of Alaska with grizzly bears, and tragically ended his life eaten, along with his girlfriend, I... Nobody deserves to die like this. But what I am getting at, and so many of your movies wrestle with this, is your view of the natural world. Because clearly you love it. You have spent so much of your life working in it, and yet yours is not a sort of benign view of nature. Yours is a very raw, dangerous - sometimes you have even talked about the murderous capacity that there is within nature. It is unsentimental, it is not a Walt Disney World view of nature, it is unromantic. That is quite obvious. I can say it in short, I love nature, I love wild nature, but most of the time, against my betterjudgement. It seems to me, unlike a lot of modern moviemakers, they are somewhat obsessed with computer-generated images, special effects, and the extraordinary fake, breathtaking visions that can be created by man and computer. You get your breathtaking visions and your beauty and your stunning visual effects from nature itself? Yes. It is how you experience nature and approach it. Sometimes, I say it is a metaphor. You know, we are all alone and exposed in the world. It is a strange attitude to the world, it somehow reveals itself to those who travel on foot. It is hard to communicate it. Nobody travels on foot nowadays. But I have done it, and I’m not like a movie now, a young lady who walks the Pacific Trail, I’m not a Trail hiker. You are not talking about Wild. Not like a backpacker. ~ travel, basically, without luggage. One walk I know you did many years ago, which has lived in my memory, was a walk around the border of Germany. Yes. I briefly want to talk about Germany. You came to fame, I guess, in the 1960s and the 1970s as part of a German new wave of filmakers, like Fassbinder and Wim Wenders. You looked unflinchingly at the post-Nazi Germany that was emerging. Now, you don’t seem to really make films about Germany, your native land, at all. Have you lost interest in Germany? No, it has always interested me. Although, I must say, I’m more Bavarian than German. Like Scottish and British! I’m more like the Scotsman for the Bavarians. I’ve always been fascinated by the country, and fascinated by the, somehow, incomprehensible barbarism. I still have not fully understood it. And I’m trying to come to grips... Does that mean, as an artist, when you think about Germany, you are still thinking about Nazis, Hitler’s legacy, rather than about some of the challenges facing Germany today? For example, its place in the modern European Union? Or the role of immigration? Germany is embedded. It’s very funny, seeing it from the outside, from the West Coast of the US, when the European Union was awarded the Peace Nobel Prize, I remember the German press was grumbling, they all wanted a photo opportunity. It was self celebratory. The euro is in chaos, Greece is giving everyone a difficult time. It was just grumbling and mumbling, and discontent. And I thought, you idiots. You blaring idiots. The European Union is the largest, biggest practised peace project that this history of this world has ever seen to. Period. You think people forget that? Celebrate it. And yet you, as you’ve alluded to, you’ve decided to live your life in California, in the United States. To me, that’s interesting. Obviously, it is the home of the biggest movie industry in the world. But Europe has so little in common with Hollywood. I thought, could Werner Herzog ever make Fitzcarraldo II? Could he ever make, what they call in Hollywood, a ‘star vehicle movie’? Built around one of the world’s biggest Hollywood stars? They can’t do what I did. Let’s caution. I do live in Los Angeles, I don’t say Hollywood. In 20 years, I’m happily married in Los Angeles. In California, my wife and I lived in San Francisco. We thought, we have to go to the place, the city with the most substance in the United States. It was very, very clear, Los Angeles, very quickly, it was clear. It is the most honest place. It has the glitz and glamour of Hollywood at the surface, but look under it, in Southern California, many things that decide the world, the trends of the world, I don’t speak of trendy things, but serious things, like collective dreams of the world in cinema, video games, computer, Internet, free speech movements, accepting gays and lesbians as an integral part of a dignified society. So you see California as a very vibrant, COl’Ilâl’|'Ipolâ8I’y pl8Câ. . . Yes, but all of the stupidity is there as well. Ah well, let’s get to stupidity in a moment... Five-year-old children going to yoga classes... Hippies and new age... Pseudo-philosophy. You talk about all of that as though you aren’t part of it. But it seems to me you have a dilemma. Hang on, let me finish. You have made movies from time to time that have involved Hollywood lTIOl’Iây, studio money. I’m thinking of Rescue Dawn, the extraordinary story of an American German pilot captured in Vietnam. When you made that movie, the New Yorker wrote a fascinating piece about how time and again you were frustrated by demands of the producers, the vast crew sent from Hollywood, there were millions of dollars at stake. Can you work with Hollywood or not? I can deal with it, and we have interesting points of meeting. There is a borderline, although sometimes, there might be friction. But, I’m better than Hollywood in some respects. Hollywood is basically the real big Hollywood, the special effects star value, all of the stars want to work with me as well. An easy position for me now, vis-a-vis Hollywood. But I’m good at storytelling. I have a suspicion I’m good at storytelling, and that is a basic and fundamental part of filmmaking. If you don’t have that big films, function. That is why Hollywood looks in my direction as well, it is totally fine. It’s interesting you say that, Hollywood looks in my direction, yOU Say. I don’t mean to sound impertinent, the one award you’ve never won, you won Best Picture at Cannes with Fitzcarraldo, but you’ve never won an Oscar for your directing. Does that rankle with you? Number one career I didn’t have. If I ever won an Oscar or not, it doesn’t make a film better or worse. It just doesn’t. It has to come naturally. You don’t spend sleepless nights over this. I enjoy seeing that colleagues of mine who are really good get Academy Awards, wonderful. I don’t need it. Because, you see, I’ve made enough films. I don’t need it really badly. Like some 24-year-old kid, I’ve made 70 films now. At the beginning, you said you haven’t stopped. Not so long ago, you said ""I think cinema can express our collective dreams more than any other medium."" Is that still true today? In the world you described of special effects and computer games? Whatever it is, yes. There is a great bandwidth of cinema, including all of the big action movies from Hollywood, from films like Star Wars, you just name it. It is good to see that. It is good for me to see that there is a wonderful type of movies like Fred Astaire, the most artificial and strange, weird films, they are wonderful. So movie magic, for you, that lives on? There is awe, magic, and I am going to hang on in. Werner Herzog, we hope so. Thank you for being on HARDtalk. Thank you very much. Our weather will be turning to something cloudier, but also milder. That process starts through Wednesday. We have got the weather out in the Atlantic. Mild air is pushing towards us throughout the day. You will notice a frost through the night into the morning across parts of Scotland. Contrast that with Southwest England. 10 degrees as we start the day. It is in the milder air that we have the cloud and outbreaks of rain. It uses off and becomes light green and drizzle across south-west England and parts of Wales. A splash of rain to the south and east. We could start with a frost to begin with. It should be frost free in Northern Ireland. But a dry and bright start for many. Temperatures -5 in some places. Cold air will still hold on throughout the day. Not especially warm. Elsewhere we will see the cloud break. A lot more cloud in recent days. It will be predominantly cloudy, with some outbreaks of rain and drizzle. A bit of snow on the mountains for a short while. Temperatures 10-12 degrees. Temperatures could hobble around 10 degrees for some. Heavy rain as it pushes south through Thursday. Introducing cold air. England and Wales will start cloudy. Then sunny weather develops, colder weather and a scattering of showers. Temperatures for the afternoon will be lower than we started. Colder weather as we go into Friday. Dry and bright weather to come. Quite a blustery day. The milder air tries to push back on Saturday. On Sunday we keep a close eye on this. A developing area of low pressure for Sunday that could bring some strong winds and rain. Hello, you’re watching BBC World News. I’m Adnan Nawaz. Our top story this hour: A verdict on the American Sniper killings. A former US Marine is convicted of killing Chris Kyle and his friend. Kyle’s memoir inspired the Hollywood film. Welcome to the programme. Other stories that we are keeping across In business: On a path to raise interest rates - Fed chiefjanet Yellen says the bank can be flexible. US stocks rise to record levels betting this is not imminent. And trying to balance the books - it is Budget day in South Africa. Will the government garner some much-needed confidence? The man accused of killing Chris Kyle, whose story inspired the Hollywood movie American Sniper, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole. A jury in Texas found Eddie Ray Routh guilty of killing the US navy marksman, along with his friend, Chad Littlefield. The killings took place at a shooting range two years ago. Our correspondent Alastair Leithead is in Los Angeles, and joins us now. Eddie Ray Routh had pleaded insanity, and yet importantly, on the day that he was arrested, he said to arrange that he understood what he had done. So if you could just remind us of what did happen that date? There was no debate over what happened, and that was that Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield took Eddie Ray Routh to a shooting range, about 100 kilometres or so from Fort Worth in Texas. This was part of things that Chris Kyle was doing, helping veterans who had issues with post-traumatic stress disorder. He did a lot of work with that. And that the shooting range, basically, Eddie Ray Routh waited until Chris Kyle had finished shooting his rounds, and then he shot both men a number of times, before then running away from that shooting range. Police went to see him, there was a car chase. But the issue in all of this was whether or not he was insane. That was the case that his defence lawyers were putting, that he was a paranoid schizophrenic and that he was insane at the time and therefore should be not guilty on the grounds of insanity. At the prosecutor disagreed. The prosecutor said that this was a cold, calculated capital murder. And it took thejuryjust calculated capital murder. And it took the jury just two hours to agree with that way that the case was presented and to find him guilty of capital murder. And the judge then automatically set that would result in life in prison without the possibility of parole. Well the law has had its day, in the wider public was there any discussion about whether this could ever have been a fair trial, whether this could ever have been a fairtrial, given the high-profile film that is in cinemas the moment? That’s right. Of course, this is a film based on Chris Kyle’s life, the Clint Eastwood film which won an Oscar over the weekend. And of course that has been an incredibly popular film course that has been an incredibly popularfilm in the US. It has brought discussion over the role of military heroes, whether this is obviously a real-life case of a man who is said to have killed a record number of combat and is in his four tours in Iraq -- number of combatants. It has also raised the issue of PTSD in the US. Hundreds of thousands of troops have come back from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who are now suffering from PTSD at various ages and levels. And as I say, this is something that Chris Kyle was involved were trying to help. He suffered himself, coming back into real life having left the US Navy SEALs. And so yes, there has been much discussion of the poster manic stress, over whether that was a factor in his killing. And there is much discussion going on at the moment about this case, on all the TV news channels, of course, in the US as well. We will be following a very. Because Chris Kyle was a military hero, but also, of course, because of the success of American Sniper, the book and the movie. Thank you very much indeed. Police here in London say they have received information that three schoolgirls, who disappeared last week, have made their way to Syria. It is feared they are already under the control of the Islamic State james Reynolds has the latest from Istanbul. Sultana and Amira Abase have made it through Turkey, and into Syria. Contacts tell the BBC that the three are with a smuggler affiliated to the so-called Islamic State. The three flew out of Gatwick a week ago, during half-term. Amira had told her father that she was going to a wedding. Sources tell us that the three girls, and the smugglers, prepared for the crossing near Kilis on the Turkey-Syria border. The smugglers claim that they got the girls into Syria four or five days ago. The girls covered their faces, and the smugglers managed to avoid Turkish surveillance, focussed on other crossings much closer to IS- held territory. The British police say that they told Turkey about the girls within a day. But Turkey insists that the UK didn’t move quickly enough. TRANSLATION: A country such as Britain, which is famous for Scotland Yard, has not closely followed these three girls despite there being concerns about them. We were informed three days after they left Heathrow and came to Istanbul. No-one stops you, or even notices you, when you leave Istanbul’s main airport. We don’t yet know exactly where the girls headed after this. But Istanbul’s bus station provides a simple and discreet route down to the border. It is incredibly easy to get the bus from Istanbul all the way to the border with Syria. A ticket only costs about £20, and the journey takes about 14 hours. One to Gaziantep. Do I have to show you my passport? No passport, OK. So you can buy a ticket to Gaziantep and you don’t have to show yOUlâ p8SSpoI’l. All you need is money. One former Turkish diplomat tells us that it is now time for his country to take a clear step. We should close the borders, that I believe, if we can. Because we don’t have any relations with Syria. No diplomatic relations. We don’t have an embassy there. We don’t have any official representative there. And we discourage our own people to go there. The British authorities represented here at the consulate say that they will continue to work with their Turkish counterparts. But it is hard to see what, if anything, either government can now realistically do. Inside Syria, the three schoolgirls are out of reach. james Reynolds, BBC News, Istanbul. As this story shows, trying to fight the attraction extremism can have The Nigerian President Goodluck jonathan says the tide has turned in the fight against Boko Haram. He said Nigeria’s army and allies were making rapid progress in recovering territory seized by the Islamist group in the north-east. But his comments came after 27 people were killed in two suicide bomb attacks on bus stations. The blasts occurred in Kano, the largest city in the north, and in the town of Potiskum. Laura Westbrook reports. This is the aftermath of another suicide bomb attack in Nigeria, the result of a strike on a major bus station in the northern city of Kano. It seems that the two bombers came as passengers from outside the city, so they came in, were driven in as passengers, in the process of moving out. after arriving at the motor park, that was the time they decided to detonate the bomb. This was the second strike in a day. Nigeria’s President Goodluck jonathan land Boko Haram for the attacks. He said the days of mourning victims of incessant terrorist attacks in the country will soon be over. Last Saturday, Nigerian troops seized the border town of Baga from Boko Haram. The Nigerian military said air strikes are under way Nigerian military said air strikes are underway in are under way in the north-east, including the town where the first -- group first declared a comfort. They seize large numbers of weapons in fighting near the town of Garambu. These military exercises were held in Chad over the weekend to prepare a joint task force to fight the Islamist militants. More than 10,000 people were killed by Boko Haram last year. Withjust a month to Nigeria’s election there is increasing pressure on the president to deliver on his promise to stop militants. What with these recent attacks, the fear is, violence against unarmed civilians will not stop any time soon. And Sally is here with all the business news. Why are you not leading with Greece?

The sprawling wreckage of an early-morning commuter train bound for Los Angeles, after it collided with a lorry left abandoned on the track. Amateur video, taken minutes after the crash, shows a giant fireball and the vehicle engulfed by flames. The collision split the scorched vehicle in two, and catapulted part of it several yards down the line. The lights went out, and itjust seemed like slow motion, seemed like it took forever. We were doing about 60 mph. The gates were down. Engineer definitely used the brake, had his emergency brake set. We were slowing down as we hit them. 28 were taken to hospital- some suffering head and spinal injuries. Among of those who escaped injury was the lorry driver. He is currently helping police with their enquiries, but it seems he may simply have taken a wrong turn. One of our patrol officers saw what he believed to be a disoriented male walking approximately 1-2 miles south of the accident scene on Rice Avenue. He was not injured in the incident, however, he was taken to a local hospital for observation and treatment.

If you’re someone who’s easily distracted you should perhaps give this next idea a miss. Our technology reporter, Dave Lee, has been given a first look at some remarkable new aviation technology that seeks to truly put our minds to use. put your mind to it, like fly a train for example. I’ve come to an airstrip on the outskirts of Lisbon, Portugal, to see some groundbreaking technology in action. This is new know, controlling the drones using just his brainwaves, all thanks to the skull cap that is constantly monitoring his brain activity. It’s a slightly unsettling demo as the growing buzz is up in the sky, struggling valiantly against the wind. It’s the first time it has been shown in public but researchers say it is the starting point for something much bigger. This is some literal blue sky thinking. Researchers say this technology could be eventually be used to power commercial flights around the world, removing the need to even have a pilot. That could seem far-fetched, but didn’t someone say that about driverless cars? It’s where it’s going, right? Technology is evolving, regulations are evolving. Both things are going at the same time and we’re learning with the technology and technology is learning from the possibilities. Obviously it’s going to happen, but the question is not if, when. The possibility of travellers being happy getting on a plane without a pilot is probably a step too far, at least for the next few generations. But the dream here is brain powered technology could, in the short-term, enable those with disabilities to control aircraft. Do I look good? Keen to see if the software was as simple as they claimed, back at the offices of the company I asked to try out a simulation. The premise is simple, once the craft is airborne I can concentrate on efforts to get this ball to go up for left or down for right. Normally people have training for this. right. Normally people have training forthis. I noticed my line as right. Normally people have training for this. I noticed my line as I’m talking especially is going up and down. Is that because I haven’t disciplined my brain yet to control it? Pretty much now it’s mostly random. Eventually what you will be able to do is control your intention as to which way to go. You will figure it out, we can’t tell you. It certainly wasn’t easy and I wondered what would happen if I fell asleep, had a seizure or let my mind wander a bit. There are various things in place to prevent bad things from happening essentially. If you were using this in a real-life scenario you would have a set of rules for operating the system to stop people getting tired, exactly like he would have in a plane. A lot needs to change before this kind of system is used in anything other than highly controlled test runs in the Portuguese countryside. Researchers on this project say the technology is almost ready, but perhaps the bigger question is are we? Sport now and Barcelona beat Manchester City in the first leg of their last 16 tie in the European Champions League on Tuesday. while the night’s other match also ended 2-1 asjuventus beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in Turin. john Bennett watched City versus Barca. Luis Suarez was the star man, his first game in England after leaving for Barcelona from Liverpool. He’s had a mixed start to his career at The Nou Camp, but look at this that, he’s been involved in 21 goals in his first 23 Barcelona games. He has scored nine and the rest were assists. Two excellent finishes as well and Manchester City were played off the park in the first 45. Second-half it was a different story. Early on Dzeko had a great chance for City, wasted that opportunity. Then Sergio Aguero got a goal back for Manchester City to give them hope in the tight, perhaps the comeback was on. They came back against Bayern Munich early in the season, would they comeback against Barcelona? Not this time because Gael Clichy was sent off for a second bookable offence, a ridiculous challenge, he is out of the second leg. Then drama at the end, Lionel Messi won a penalty, Zabaleta with the foul. Messi steps up, butjoe Hart makes the save, it rebound is back to Messi, he has an open goal, a diving header but it goes wide. Should have been 3-1 to Barca, perhaps Manchester City will see themselves as fortunate that it was only macro 21. The US PGA has announced that Davis Love III will captain the United States Ryder Cup team at Hazeltine next year.

It is a cold and sunny winter day in Tokyo and families are out enjoying the animals at Tama Zoo. Then, over the loudspeaker, an announcement. From the sleepy tone you might be hard put to tell, but this is a warning. There has, she says, been an earthquake and an animal has escaped. So, the earthquake has apparently damaged some of the cages and at least one wild animal has managed to escape. Apparently it’s coming in this direction. We’ve been told we need to get out of here as soon as we can. Zoo staff are rushing to set up nets to prevent the animal getting any further. Then from around the corner it appears. A man in a catsuit? The zoo staff tries to block him, but the snow leopard attacks. A man is down and the leopards slinks off, looking slightly guilty. A few minutes later he has nearly made it to the zoo’s front gate, but they set up another barrier and this time there is no escape. A dart is fired. The snow leopard stumbles. He’s down. Still, better make sure! To the watching media it has all been great fun. But the man in the suit insists it is supposed to be very realistic. TRANSLATION: Istudied how the leopard moves. The most important thing is not to look like the real animal, but to move like the real animal. Still, not everyone is convinced. Was it scary, he asks this little boy. You’re not scary at all, he answers. Of course, it might be a little different if it had been a real earthquake and one of these real big cats was on the loose instead.

US stocks rise to record levels, betting this is not imminent. And trying to balance the books - it is budget day in South Africa. Will the government garner some much-needed confidence? Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Sally Bu ndock. Also in the programme: There has been a rebound in China’s factories. Rico Hizon will have the details. US central bankerjanet Yellen made it clear interest rates in America won’t go up until the middle of this year at the earliest. That clarity helped markets rise to record levels in New York. The Fed chief was giving her semi-annual testimony on monetary policy, in which she emphasized that the US recovery was on course, though not yet secure. Michelle Fleury reports from New York. If she was feeling under pressure, she didn’t show it. janet Yellen runs the central bank of the world’s largest economy. Her decisions have the power to affect us all. As she began two days of hearings, she was clear. The economy is making progress. Long-term unemployment has declined substantially. Fewer workers are reporting they can find only part-time work, when they would prefer full-time employment. And the pace of quits, often referred to as a barometer of labour market opportunities, has recovered nearly to its prerecession level. But the body that sets interest rates, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is not declaring victory yet. Not with wage growth stunted and muted. The committee considers it unlikely that economic conditions will warrant an increase in the target range for the Federal funds raised for at least the next couple of FOMC meetings. Miss Yellen’s remarks were designed to give the central bank flexibility, as it comes closer to raising interest rates, in case of risks, including those from abroad. Foreign economies are confronting a number of challenges that could restrain economic activity. In China, economic growth could slow more than anticipated. And it wasn’t just lawmakers listening closely. On Wall Street, investors liked what they heard. Stocks closed at fresh highs. janet Yellen used her first day of testimony to provide greater clarity on the timing of the first interest rate hike. Most investors here on Wall Street still think that such a move is likely in june or September. But whenever America’s central bank does increase interest rates in the world’s largest economy, it will be the world ‘s first such increase since 2006. Has been a long time rates went up in the US. So markets around the world are now betting that interest rates are headed higher towards the end of the year in the US. For reaction in Asia, let’s go to Rico Hizon in Singapore. So markets all thinking about janet Yellen, but also news out of China. That’s right, Sally. Asian stocks were volatile for the most part factory output index about to be released but the have digestive that interest rates in America won’t go up until the middle of this year at the earliest, and China’s purchasing managers index was better than expected. Manufacturing activity edged up to 50.1 and that is a four-month high in China, and snapped two consecutive months of contraction. The purchasing managers index reading, which read about 50 means an expansion, while anything below suggests a contraction. And these developments, all put together, have given some support to investors in Asia who were worried about the deteriorating global output. And also helping gains here to a certain extent, news that eurozone partners had approved Rhys’s reform plan. So in late Asian trading japan is flat as investors ta ke in late Asian trading japan is flat as investors take profits as investors ta ke profits after stocks gained fresh 15 year highs but the likes of Australia, japan, China, Singapore and Korea are all in positive territory today. Thank you very much, we will see you again soon. Markets boosted to a degree. It is budget day in South Africa, and its finance minister has a difficult task ahead, of balancing the books. The country’s economy is struggling to grow above 2%, and public debt is on the rise. joblessness is still a chronic problem, with unemployment at nearly 25%, and recently South Africa’s credit rating was downgraded. Lerato Mbele has more from johannesburg. All eyes will be on South Africa’s Parliament today as the Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene delivers his Budget for 2015. He is expected to provide some answers as to why it is that the South African economy has weakened further in the past year. And probably come up with solutions on how to stimulate growth, keep investors’ money in the country, and create jobs. investors’ money in the country, and createjobs. Here create jobs. Here at this market, informal traders eke out a living each day. They are concerned about the possibility of rising taxes such as VAT, rising prices, and the volatile currency which is impacting how they run their businesses. Eric is one such trade. What would you like to hear the Minister say? I am expecting a lot. As you can see behind you, I am running a business. So we are hoping we can have more money to implement our business. There is nojobs and we are struggling to make a living by this business. Thank you very much. Supporting small business is a big theme in South Africa but the one thing holding the minister back will be the steady supply of electricity. In the past few weeks there have been rolling outages in the country as the national utility company failed to complete its maintenance programme. In a recent speech, president has pledged over $2 billion to finance the problems at the national utility company. Locals will also be concerned about whether taxes will rise and foreign investors will be watching to see whether the minister can create a business friendly environment where their investments are safe from volatile markets, Labour unrest, and xenophobic attacks. And our team will keep you up-to-date today as that Budget speech is delivered later, and of course there will be a lot more information on that on our website. So look at that as well. In other news: The EU Finance Commissioner has said the eurozone’s approval of changes by Greece to its bailout programme has averted an immediate financial crisis. But Pierre Moscovici warned that the deal was only the starting point for talks on how Athens would implement the reforms, in return for a four-month extension of its funding arrangements. Hewlett Packard, the world’s second-biggest computer maker, has forecast worse-than-expected full-year results, blaming a strengthening US dollar. The firm also said its revenue for the quarter ending injanuary was $26.8 billion, down 5% from a year earlier. And net income fell to $1.37 billion, from $1.43 billion a year earlier. The firm saw its shares fall more than 6% in after-hours trading on the news. HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver and chairman Douglas Flint are facing a grilling by MPs over allegations that the bank’s Swiss branch helped wealthy customers dodge tax. The bank bosses are due to appear before the House of Commons Treasury Committee just days, after it was announced that Mr Gulliver received pay and bonuses of £7.6 million last year, despite a 17% fall in profits. Let’s have a look at those markets. Ricco was mentioning the stories affect in Asian trade today. And todayis affect in Asian trade today. And today is Wednesday, we have the markets in Shanghai open again following their long break for the lunar New Year holiday. As you can see, japanjust down lunar New Year holiday. As you can see, japan just down slightly but is hovering at 15 year highs. Hong Kong doing well off the back of that is about China’s manufacturing sector and let’s look at the close in the US. As we have mentioned, fresh record highs for markets on Wall Street. And of course this followed a good day in Europe because of the agreement about Greece. The FTSE is not prepared for the launch of crucial pension freedoms in April. The head of the Association of British Insurers, Huw Evans, will say today that critical pieces of the jigsaw will not be in place in time. Our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz has more. George Osborne and other ministers seldom waste an opportunity to dig UP seldom waste an opportunity to dig up the new pension freedoms, with the launch looming and the election close behind. Pension savers will be able to use their nest eggs as they like, from 55. Subject to some income tax. But Huw Evans, who speaks for the insurers who manage many pensions, will say today this. Guidance, online, over the Guidance, online, overthe phone or face-to-face, is being promised to hundreds of thousands who might need it each year, but insurers complained that there is no phone number yet to complained that there is no phone numberyet to direct number yet to direct people to. Nor do insurers know how face-to-face sessions will work. There is no detail on numbers who will use the guidance or likely waiting times, or on rules for dealing with customers hungry for help. It is a tight timetable for insurers to get themselves ready anyway. But the Treasury said this. To ease any To EBSQ any pI’âSSUI’â, is also telling people there is no need to rush to take advantage of their pension freedoms. The two people in the studio with me are talking about barbecues in Turkey. We will explain that in a few minutes for international visitors. Actually, no, you will be with us. At 6am you will not. Coming up at 6:00am on Breakfast, Louise Minchin and Bill Turnbull will have all the day’s news, business and sport. They’ll also have more on tougher regulations to clamp down on cold callers that are to be announced by the Government today. They aim to make it easier to prosecute companies responsible for nuisance calls. Last year more than 175,000 complaints were made to the Information Commissioner’s Office about nuisance calls. I’m Adnan Nawaz. The top stories this hour: A former US marine has been found guilty of killing Chris Kyle, whose story inspired the Hollywood movie American Sniper. Eddie Ray Routh was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Kyle had taken Routh to a shooting range to try to help him overcome symptoms of post-traumatic stress caused by his military service in Iraq. There has been much discussion over post-traumatic stress, over whether that that was a factor in his killing. And there is much discussion going on at the moment about this case on all the TV news channels here in the US, of course, as well. They have been following it very closely because Chris Kyle was a military hero, but also of course because of the success of American Sniper, the book, and that movie. British police say they have received information that three London schoolgirls missing from their homes since last week have successfully made their way into Syria to join successfully made their way into Syria tojoin Islamic State. The BBC understands the girls were smuggled across the border from Turkey four or five days ago. At least 27 people have been killed in two suicide bombings in the north of Nigeria. However the country’s President Goodluckjonathan has said the tide has turned against the Islamist militants Boko Haram. He said rapid progress was being made in recovering territory seized by the group in north-east Nigeria. Britain has become the first country in the world to legalise the creation of babies using the DNA from three people. The treatment replaces defective genes to prevent certain inherited diseases. Opponents including some religious groups says its approval is part of a slippery slope towards designer babies and eugenics. A barbecue or Christmas turkey? Everything will be come apparent in our newspaper review. What’s making headlines around the world? The Guardian has an article about British troops being deployed to Ukraine. The military trainers won’t be sent to conflict zones in the east, but the paper reports the move will intensify the standoff with Russia. Shares rocket to record high, that’s the headline in the Daily Express. The current surge in the FTSE 100, tops the previous record set during the dot-com boom more than 15 years ago. In America, signs that zero interest rates are coming to an end. The US edition of the Financial Times has Federal Reserve chairwoman janet Yellen cautiously optimistic about the performance of the American economy. The International New York Times has the historic relationship thaw between the United States and Cuba. But will it create bigger racial and class divide on the Caribbean island? There’s an apparent rift within French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. After the terror attack targeting its newsroom, the publication is now selling fast. In the Wall Street journal, there are claims staff members are divided over the windfall. And with the 2022 Qatar World Cup final possibly being held on December 23rd, what will be more important- football or Christmas? ~ I think Ithinkl joining us is Lawrence Gosling, editor-in-chief of Investment Week. Good morning. This is a really big story, British troops going to Ukraine. It looks like the UK territory and now the UK has deployed the Guardian describes Ukraine to provide military support for the anti- Putin forces in this scenario. It’s potentially quite worrying, albeit Putin said the other day on television that there will not be a war in the Ukraine between Russia and the Ukraine. But it makes you feel very nervous. The PM said Britain would be the strongest poll in the tent in his speech. Which is a, kind of, rather odd expression in the context. Part of the politics is the UK is wanting to look like it’s taking a strong stance against Russia. just before an election? just before an election, Prime Minister Cameron has been very strong in leading the economic sanctions against Russia which, until recently, had looked like they had played some part in causing a bit of an ease off in the problems there. Interesting piece of politics. Let’s look at the Daily Express, the first time we have looked at this picture in this particular paper review. This is the front page of the FT as well and other newspapers. The express’s angle on this, giving millions of savers and pension holders a huge shot in the arm. The express is correct. If you have an investment, a pension, an ISA or something like that, which is linked to the stock market and shares, looking at the valuation today it has gone up, so that’s good news. In stock markets we all look for highs and lows, with just about to breakdown the 7000 barrier for the just about to breakdown the 7000 barrierfor the FTSE, which is a number that everybody in the market looks for as a sign of confidence. Is it a sign of confidence, that’s the question, or is this another bubble waiting to burst? Last time this happened we have the dot com bubble that burst, which had a huge impact at the time. It’s a good question. It’s a small bubble. There’s no reason why shares should be as high as they are, the economy is in reasonable shape, nothing fantastic, nothing compared to the dot com bubble period. There is a fear in the market there could be a small correction. In the FT, how important is it that interest rates go up? Why is it so bad the way they are at the moment? If interest rates stayed too low for too long we risk falling into the deflation period. That’s where all prices fall back. At the moment we are in good deflation because things like the price of oil has dropped, and that is good for most consumers. If it stays too low for too long, is why the whole interest rate thing is. And the US normally leads the way on this sort of thing. How is janet Yellen doing? -- big in best is. Issue managing it right in terms of global expectations? -- big investors. She is playing a blind of a game. She is managing the situation so well. -- a blinder. She is picking her words carefully, giving clear signals, albeit not explicit signals. There’s no volatility after her statements, a good sign? A great sign. She is saying what the markets are thinking, that’s always good when the two are largely in sync. I did a postgraduate degree in Latin American politics, I lived in Chile for a year. The story on the International New York Times is about the financial gap between white and nonwhite, you can take it all across Latin America. In Santiago, the Chilean capital, the height differential because of how people took and nutrition, basically eight, the height differential between whites and nonwhites is six inches on average. That’s interesting. You know very well, and I’ve been to Cuba as well, is a broad ethnic mix there. Again, as we all know, there’s a large exiled Cuban population in Florida, and other parts of the US. There is remitting money back to, sending money back to, either. This is about pumping $1 billion-$3,000,000,000 into the Cuban economy. The cap on this is going to be removed. Where is the inequality and wealth going to go? Probably the same people it was going to go to originally but in large sums, so that will create an inequality in wealth. The poorer parts of Cu ban inequality in wealth. The poorer parts of Cuban society will probably become even poorer. A brief comment on Charlie Hebdo because we want to have some time for the football. They have a problem they did not expect, a massive windfall because they are selling more magazines than ever before. The publication was pretty much bust two months ago and now it is flourishing and staff want shares in the company. The 40% shareholder is saying no, he is one of the cartoonists and he says money can make people crazy. It’s ironic and tragic it is developing into a row over money. Finally the Daily Telegraph. It could be that the 2022 World Cup final is on the 23rd of December, the cartoonist, Matt, has the three wise men saying: It is rare breed because you think it’s a good idea to have December. Ido, for a couple of reasons. One of the mandates of FIFA is to spread football globally. It had to go to the Middle East at some point, we always knew the weather issue would be a problem. I don’t see this as a particular problem. And football, especially in Europe, is almost a 52 week a year sporting opportunity. I actually quite like the idea of having a breakfrom opportunity. I actually quite like the idea of having a break from the normal Premier League /European competitions in Novemberfor this. competitions in November for this. We competitions in Novemberfor this. We all enjoy... Football fans like me enjoy the African Cup of Nations. Apart from anything else, and I’m the most ignorant of the three for -- by a long way, the conditions will certainly help England? You are certainly getting desperate there. We should disregard that from the equation. Can Ijust not fly the flag? I’m of the same opinion, England’s game is not good enough. We are talking about the economy, Christmas, briefly, would people be spending as much money on food and wine with this coming up? They will spend more because the food you buy during a World Cup tournament is different. It is normally burgers. Will it be burgers and Turkey all burgers and goose? Mould lager? Interesting. We will try that if we ever get a chance -- or burgers. Half the world trying to get home after the World Cup final on the 24th? Interesting. Our weather will be turning to something cloudier, but also milder. That process starts through Wednesday. We have got the weather out in the Atlantic. Mild air is pushing towards us throughout the day. You will notice a frost through the night into the morning across parts of Scotland. It could get down to -5 or -6 in some spots. Contrast that with south-west England. 10 degrees as we start the day. It may be light and patchy with heavy bursts around in the morning. It uses off and becomes light green and drizzle across south-west England and parts of Wales. Particularly in the hills around 8am. A splash of rain to the south and east. We could start with a frost to begin with. In the east of the Pennines we should have a frost to begin with. It should be frost free in Northern Ireland. But a dry and bright start for many. Very cold in some parts of the north-east. Temperatures -5 in some places. Cold air will still hold on throughout the day. Not especially warm. Elsewhere we will see the cloud break. A bit of sunshine. A lot more cloud in recent days. Into the afternoon a good part of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales will be cloudy. It will be predominantly cloudy, with some outbreaks of rain and drizzle. A bit of snow on the mountains for a short while. That will ease down to rain later. Temperatures 10-12 degrees. Temperatures could hover around 10 degrees for some. Heavy rain as it pushes south through Thursday. Reintroducing cold air. England and Wales will start cloudy. It will clear from the south-east corner in the afternoon. Then sunny weather develops, colder weather and a scattering of showers. Temperatures for the afternoon will be lower than we started. 4-9 degrees at the very best. Colder weather as we go into Friday. Dry and bright weather to come. A few showers scattered here and there. Quite a blustery day. The milder air tries to push back on Saturday. On Sunday we keep a close eye on this. A developing area of low pressure for Sunday that could bring some strong winds and rain. Iam marooned...here. Ohhhh! Ow, ow, ow. This is my frankly brilliant plan. Where are they?! Ohh! Ooh! Good lad. # MasterChef is big and bold... # Sweet, sour, salty and hot. # Back again, or so I’m told... # Make it fiery, be bold. # Mix up, one, two, chop, chop, three, four # Can contestants do enough? # Your fondant potato is buttery and soft. # The competition is mighty tough. # Ohh! Ooh! Good lad. Any reason you’re shaking like that? Cos I’m terrified. Let battle commence. Hello, this is Breakfast, with Bill Turnbull and Louise Minchin. A clampdown on cold callers. Companies could be fined up to £500,000 and prosecuted afterjust a single complaint. A change in the rules will mean people bothered by unwanted calls will no longer have to prove distress before they take action. Good morning, it’s Wednesday, the 25th of February.

Greater Manchester is to become the first English region given full control over health spending.

And Kate will be here with a full weather forecast in half-an-hour. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Greater Manchester is to become the first English region to get full control of its health spending, as part of a significant extension of devolved powers. Ten councils will take over the local NHS budget from April next year, and integrate it with social care, which they already run. The combined budget will be worth about £6 billion a year and will give them full control over hospitals, GPs’ surgeries and drop in centres. Our health correspondent, Dominic Hughes, reports. How to deliver better care to an ageing population with growing health needs. One idea is to integrate health and social care and to let the local NHS manage its own budget. How is it going today? That is what’s being proposed in Greater Manchester. At his surgery in Stockport, this GP says patients will benefit. To bring together and co-ordinate everything for Greater Manchester is something people have dreamt about for decades. And what we could do now is at long last move Greater Manchester from having some of the highest spend on healthcare, but some of the worst health outcomes in the country, to having Greater Manchester have some of the best health outcomes in the country over a period of time. In the past, many decisions on how to spend the NHS budget were taken by civil servants in London, in Whitehall. Under these changes, those decisions will now be taken here in Greater Manchester. The region is to be handed control of its entire £6 billion NHS budget. It’s understood the Treasury will transfer that spending power to ten local councils and NHS providers from April 2016. The decision will affect all of Manchester’s 2.7 million inhabitants. It’s devolution on a scale never seen before in the Health Service. For example, if a doctor has a patient who is suffering from being in a cold, damp house, he or she could, for the first time, prescribe proper home insulation and proper heating for that home. This could be the first time that the state works properly for all of its people. The integration of health and social care already happens in Northern Ireland. Scotland will start the process this year. But some are warning there are potential problems. There’s risks of further organisational change, when the NHS has onlyjust recovered from the last big upheaval. I think there are major issues about money when the NHS and care system are struggling to cope as it is. And there’s some important questions about who will be accountable for this resource under the new arrangement. What happens when the money runs out? But patients in Stockport backed the idea. They can’t rule from London any longer. We should have everything local. If decisions are moved to local areas, then that’s going to be of benefit for local people. Labour accuses the Government of creating a two-tier NHS in England, but the debate around devolving power and money is moving fast. Dominic Hughes, BBC News, Stockport. Our assistant political editor, Norman Smith, is in Westminster. The question is, why George Osborne is doing this and why now? jane, it’s a big move for the Health Service. This is a big move politically, too. It is an attempt by the Chancellor to wrong foot Labour, to shoot some prized Labour foxes. Fox number one is Labour’s big idea for the NHS. Why? Labour’s big idea is to bring together health and social care and the Chancellor can say, ""I’m doing it in Manchester."" Number two, devolution, handing Manchester."" Number two, devolution, handing out powers from Westminster. Why? George Osborne says I’m creating the Northern Powerhouse, giving Manchester greater control over their NHS. But it comes with a risk. The risk is that George Osborne shoots himself in the foot. Why? The fear is, this will be seen as yet another NHS reorganisation. It reminds voters of the ghost of Andrew Lansley. Labour are now trying to go on the attack and say it risks the break-up of the NHS. Thank you. There’ve been fierce exchanges in the Commons this lunchtime about the issue of second jobs for Mps. Ed Miliband called on David Cameron to vote in favour of a cap on the amount a politician can earn from work outside Parliament. Mr Cameron said he doesn’t rule out further changes - but insisted important safeguards are already in place. It follows the ""cash-for-access"" row involving two former foreign secretaries, Sir Malcolm Rifkind and jack Straw. Our Political correspondent Carole Walker reports. Two former Foreign Secretaries, Sir Malcolm Rifkind and jack Straw, under investigation after they were secretly-filmed apparently offering to work for a private company for cash. Both deny any wrongdoing. Sir Malcolm said his work as an MP and committee chairman left him plenty of time for otherjobs. In the Commons, the Labour Leader called on the Prime Minister to back his party’s motion banning MPs from paid directorships or consultancies. The difficulty with his specific proposal is that it would allow for instance someone to be a paid trade union official but it wouldn’t allow someone to run a family business, or a family shop. Like many of his proposals, it’s not thought through. Ed Miliband came back with an unexpected offer. Let’s agree now that we’ll rule out anyone being a paid trade union official, a paid director, a paid director, ora paid consultant. Say yes and we can restore the reputation of this House. At the moment, MPs are banned from working as paid advocates for anyone else inside Parliament. But the Code of Conduct is less clear on what they can do outside the House. They must avoid conflict between personal and public interest. Be open and frank about their financial interests. And avoid damaging the reputation and integrity of the Commons. So, as they seek to restore their muddied reputations, should MPs be allowed second jobs at all? People shouldn’t have second salaries at all. Personally, I would ban it. It is not a full-time job. There’s a huge commitment in it and you work all hours and all days. But there is plenty of time in which you can do other things. The rules won’t change in this Parliament, but MPs may now have to consider all this again after the election. And Carole is in Westminster. The ferocity of those exchanges, does that show us how toxic almost this issue of cash for access has become? Yes, indeed. Frankly, the sight of MPs arguing over whatjobs they should or should not be allowed to do, in addition to theirjobs as Members of Parliament, are not going to impress many voters who will say that if somebody is employed on £65,000-plus a year to work as an MP, to represent their constituents, they should be doing that full-time and putting all their efforts into that. Many MPs who do have second jobs say that it takes them outside the Westminster bubble, it keeps them in touch with the sorts of problems that many families are facing in their real lives. So, there is a political divide on this. But many MPs do agree on one thing. They would rather be talking about something else altogether with that election looming in May. Thank you. 175,000 people made a formal complaint last year about cold calls. From April, it should be easier to clamp down on the companies that make them, or send nuisance texts. At the moment, it has to be proved that the call has caused substantial distress - but the government says that threshold will be lowered, and penalties will include fining companies up to half a million pounds. Our business correspondent Emma Simpson reports. The curse of the cold-call, millions of us get bombarded at home or on the move. This morning, I spoke to Martin Shelley. He’s retired and the unwanted calls are never-ending. In an average day, I get three or four, if not more, unsolicited calls on my landline. It is between somebody with something to sell and they are usually dressing up selling as some kind of Government grant, energy conservation, loft insulation, window replacement, so it intrudes in your life horribly. That is despite the fact that Martin signed UP despite the fact that Martin signed up to this scheme that is supposed to stop unwanted calls. Last year, there were more than 175,000 complaints about nuisance calls and texts. But rogue companies ignore the rules. Now, the Government is clamping down. It’s lowering the threshold for prosecuting nuisance callers. Companies could also face fines of up to £500,000 and the Government wants to hold senior executives responsible for unwanted calls and texts made by their firms. This is much more of a deterrent for firms. We believe that if in the past they were only fined if there was substantial damage or distress. Now, it’s an offence just doing it. Many think the Government could be doing more including the body representing legitimate companies. For example, the displaying of the caller identification that would help identify these companies and there needs to be more effort by the telecoms companies and the regulators to try to track down from a technical perspective these calls that are being made from overseas. It’s certainly not the end of the line for cold-callers, but come April, it will be easier to punish those companies who break the law. Emma Simpson, BBC News. New figures show that the number of zero hours contracts in the UK has increased, from 1.4 million to 1.8 million. The numbers are based on a survey of businesses last August by the Office for National Statistics. Our Employment Correspondent john Moylan is with me. What’s behind a fairly substantial rise? The figures suggest that the prevalence of these contracts that don’t guarantee a minimum number of hours are on the rise. The headline figure that you mentioned there, the £1.8 million, that compares to EIA EI.8 million, that compares to EIA million last time. The EI.8 million was measured during a two-week period in the summer. That is when you get a lot of seasonal work, in tourism and farming. There is no doubt there has been an impact. It seems these contracts are rising. We did get another figure today. The number of people who think they are on the contracts, again that was up significantly, 20%, up at £697,000, 2.3% of the workforce. It suggests there is a rise going on. But there has been a big controversy around these contracts. Lots of publicity. It may well be there aren’t more people on the contracts, just more people who now know they are on the contracts, so the trend suggests that the rise in this kind of flexible, though insecure way of working is increasing. Given that then, what reaction? Inevitably, employers’ groups like these flexible contracts. They say they have protected the UK from high levels of unemployment. The Government recognises there has been abuse of these contracts. Some employers have been forcing people to work exclusively for them on these contracts. They will ban that. Labour today say they will ban exploitive zero hours contracts and will give people who work regular hours the right to fixed-hours contracts. Unions who represent workers have said that these figures today sum up everything that’s gone wrong in the UK’s labour market. Thank you. World football’s governing body, Fifa, says it will not pay compensation to European clubs unhappy about plans to play the 2022 Qatar World Cup in November and December. Fifa’s Secretary General, jerome Valcke, also said no apology was necessary for the scheduling of the tournament, which will severely disrupt a number of European leagues. Our sports news correspondent Richard Conway is in Doha. Yesterday we had the decision that the World Cup would be moved from the summer to the winter. Today the men who must now build a dream in Qatar told the world about their plans. Anyone hoping for a sign of contrition perhaps given the controversy that the issue has generated, they were soon to be disappointed. My report contains some flash photography. The cold wind that blows through Qatar at this time of year often creates sandstorms. But this decision to move the World Cup from summer to decision to move the World Cup from summerto winter has decision to move the World Cup from summer to winter has whipped up a ten person within the footballing world. The biggest tournament of the game will be played at a time of year when the British fans and players are more accustomed to conditions like this. The world governing body though the leaves it had no option and today they were in no mood to offer sympathy to those who object. We are bringing all the people to enjoy the sporting and the financial result of the World Cup. So why apologise. I definitely do not feel I have to apologise for the decision which has been made yesterday. To confirm that the World Cup will not be played in summer but in winter. Organisers of the cat or World Cup say that their tournament will be like no other. In spite of the grand promises, the big European teams remain unconvinced of why they should be the ones to bear the brunt of the switch to the winter. The impact of the decision will be felt across three seasons but the domestic season will be put on hold for at least six weeks, significantly in the run-up to the traditional Christmas and New Year games. It is so disruptive to English football, British and European football. It messes up the calendar completely and will be difficult to deal with. It could affect all kinds of contracts and have all kinds of effects on clubs and their incomes in that year. So we are more than entitled to expect compensation. But those demands for compensation were swiftly dismissed today in Doha. There will be no compensation. They have seven years to reorganise the game for this World Cup. Some seven years before a ball has even been kicked, a World Cup organisers hope will fans, players, teams and nations in a celebration of football, is instead exposing the deep divisions of the game. Well we have read today that Fifa have been at talking to sponsors and broadcasters, they want to eliminate any kind of legal claims that will result from the switch. They are determined now to put this issue in the past. Our top story this lunchtime. Greater Manchester is to become the first English region given full control over health spending. And still to come - jailed for life - the killer of the real life American Sniper is sentenced to life in prison. Coming up in sport at 1.30. A thrilling finish at the Gabba as the Irish make it two wins from two at the Cricket World Cup. Ireland reached their target of 279 against the UAE with just two balls to spare. An opinion poll carried out for the BBC suggests that the majority of British Muslims oppose violence against people who publish images depicting the Prophet Muhammad. But just over a quarter of those questioned said they had some sympathy for the motives behind the recent terrorist attacks in Paris. Sima Kotecha reports. A new edition of the Charlie Hebdo magazine hits newsstands in France today. It was this magazine’s publication of a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad that led to gunmen storming its offices and killing 12 people. DISTANT SIRENS From conflicts in the Middle East to those attacks in Paris, negative stories involving Muslims are often in the headlines. So how has that left members of the Muslim community here in the UK feeling? The BBC commissioned a poll to try and find out. The results suggests that 68% of Muslims feel acts of violence against those who publish images of the Prophet can never be justified. But a quarter said they have some sympathy for the motives behind the recent shootings in Paris. Almost all those surveyed felt a loyalty to Britain and around half said they felt this country was becoming less tolerant of Muslims. Here in Bradford, people are still angry about what happened in Paris. The vast majority of Muslims are peace-loving, you know, they do their best to help their neighbours, to fit into society, to integrate. But that is completely being washed away by one or two individuals. Murder was not the answer, never in a million years, murder was not the answer. I’m completely against that. People shouldn’t be murdering in the name of Islam. Muslims here say they’re being unfairly scrutinised, that they’re being branded as extremists. They say they shouldn’t have to apologise for a tiny minority of fundamentalists. Some argue they must work harder to integrate, while the rest of the UK must work harder to eliminate prejudice. Seema Kotecha, BBC News. Officers from dish transport police have identified photographs of seven men they want to identify following scenes in Paris last weekend when Chelsea fans refuse to allow a man to board a train. The chairman and chief executive of HSBC will appear before a panel of MPs in the next hour to answer questions about a tax scandal at the bank. Earlier this month, it emerged that the Swiss arm of HSBC helped wealthy clients evade hundreds of millions of pounds in taxes. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed is here. What will the Parliamentary committee be wanting to hear from these men. It will be a piece of dramatic Theatre. The first time we have seen Stewart Gulliver, the chief executive, and the chairman Douglas Flint, in public since these allegations were revealed a number of weeks ago. Portstewart Gulliver, the key question will be, has he done enough to clean up the bank. These allegations date from 2005 two 2007, some years ago. You will be asked about whether there has been enough to get compliance and governance in order and he will be asked about the complicated payment structures. He had a Swiss bank account and one in Panama. He said it was for reasons of confidentiality. But Douglas Flint, the chairman, has been at the bank since the 1990s. What responsibility did he have and has he ensured that has been enough of a clean-up. And what are HMRC saying about the people not paying the tax. Well after the two men comes Lin Homer, and she will be asked by MPs why have they not been more prosecutions on this issue for customers of the bank in 2005 who evaded taxes. Initially they claimed there would be I2 prosecutions, there has only been one. I think she will be asked why that is the case. An increasing number of people over the age of 70 are being stopped from driving for medical reasons. In the last year, the figure rose by a third to nearly 13,000. Our correspondent, judith Moritz, has been speaking to one older driver who’s taking steps to ensure he remains safe on the road. These are things that upset me, bicycles. Since learning to drive in 1960, Bob has clocked up plenty of miles. Now, 76, he still gets behind the wheel every day, but he doesn’t take that for granted, and he has entered himself for a voluntary test to check he is still safe on the road. Everybody thinks they are a perfect driver. I always did, but I realised I am not. I started making one or two mistakes. Is it reassurance, what are you looking for? Peace of mind, as much as anything. Peace of mind, of knowing that I’m safe. Legally, drivers over the age of 70 have to renew their license every three years. All drivers must declare any medical conditions that may affect theirdriving. They can be prosecuted or fined £1,000 if they don’t. Of all those on the roads, the Institute of Advanced Motorists says it is the over 70s who make the safest drivers, causing the fewest injuries and often avoiding driving during rush hour and late at night. Until 18 months ago, George would park his car on the driveway. Now 82, he has come off the road, due to his health and eyesight. I’ve come to terms with it, and I realise I wouldn’t like to be involved in an accident causing somebody injury, because that’s the ultimate price of it. Itjust isn’t worth it. There are currently 38 million licensed drivers in Great Britain. The DVLA says it is not clear why there has been such a surge in the number of older drivers losing their licenses on health grounds. More than 400 children had a taser drawn on them by police in England and Wales in 2013 - that’s according to figures obtained by Radio Five Live under a Freedom of Information request. The figures also show that the a taser was fired in 37 of those incidents. The former Home Secretary David Blunkett, who introduced Tasers, says its now time for a review of their use. Sarah Corker reports. Described as a nonlethal weapon for police officers facing potentially dangerous suspects, the use of Tasers is growing and so is the concern about who they are fired on. The use of Tasers on children should be banned. And that includes just pointing a Taser at a child. Many of the children who come into contact with the police will be vulnerable, will have mental health conditions and police shouldn’t be pointing Tasers at children in this situation. In England and Wales in 2013, 431 children, 17 and under, had a Taser drawn on them - that’s a 38% increase on 2012. It was fired on children 37 times. The youngest aged 14. The Government argues the data may not be reliable as some of the ages of people Tasered are estimates. Officers are told to only use Tasers when threatened with violence, but they remain controversial. Critics argue they can deliver a 50,000 volt shock and can be dangerous if misused. So can it ever be justified to Taser a child? Now the man who first introduced them back in 2004, then Home Secretary David Blunkett, says we need to look again at the circumstances in which they are used. And the Chief Constable, leading a national review into how officers handle Tasers, says the figures show it is being used sparingly. It’s a deterrent to tell that person don’t make me use this, unless I have to. Then, very often that will de-escalate and take the threat away. When officers are faced with some of the most challenging situations, with firearms, with knives, where some people are threatening to hurt themselves, the age factor comes into their considerations but they can’t say this person’s I5, therefore I can’t Taser. And police officers say they need to be able to adequately protect themselves in scenarios like this that can be a reality on the streets. Sarah Corker, BBC News. The RAF Red Arrows have revealed a new design inspired by the Union flag on the tail fins of their world-famous displayjets. It’s the first change of livery since the 1960s. The team who featured in 80 displays across the globe last year are currently preparing for the new season. Nick Childs reports. For half a century they have delighted crowds around the country and around the world with their exceptional flying skills. Officially the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, they are known universally as the Red Arrows, one of the world’s premier display formations. They have been metaphorically flying the flag, now they really are. The new tail fin design inspired by the Union Flag was originally a one-off to mark the team’s 50th season last year. It is now being applied to all the team’s Hawkjet trainers to replace the three-striped livery that has been used since the 1960s. This year we have put a new tail fin on which signifies the next 50 years continuing to represent all of the RAF personnel protecting and defending the United Kingdom. The Red Arrows have been highly successful ambassadors, their breathtaking aerial ballets seen in over 4,500 displays in 56 countries. They have also become an indispensable spectacle at numerous national pageants and ceremonies. But they have endured tragedies as well. Including this crash at an air display in Bournemouth in 2011 in which the pilot died. There have been periodic scares about disbandment in various rounds of defence cuts but for now, the new look Red Arrows are training intensively for their new display season, expected to get under way in May. Nick Childs, BBC News. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today. Greater Manchester is to become the first English region given full control over health spending. In a moment, a full national weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first with all the day’s sport, here’s Will Perry at the BBC Sports Centre. The Irish remain unbeaten at the Cricket World Cup. After seeing off West Indies in style earlier in the tournament, they had a tougher challenge against the UAE this morning, Tim Hague reports. It is rare in World Cup history that Ireland have taken their seats as favourites for a match. Against the United Arab Emirates they were and began accordingly. The first four wickets fell early. While the Irish kicked their opponents when they were down, Anwar then made a century. The first man to do so from his country at the World Cup. How Anwar or any batsman would like the fortune that came Ed joyce’s way. Bowled but the bails didn’t fall. joyce’s luck could soon end and Ireland were in real trouble for a time before a half-century from Gary Wilson and a smashing fifty from Kevin O’Brien put them in with a chance. It went to the final over before the Irish nudged themselves over the line. Two wins from two for them, although they may prefer being underdogs again in the next match. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini says they can still beat Barcelona in their last 16 Champions League tie, despite losing the first leg 2-1 at the Etihad. Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez scored both goals for Barca. City rallied in the second half, Sergio Aguero gave them a glimmer of hope and the home side were let off the hook late on, Lionel Messi fluffed his penalty and the rebound in injury time. It means City will need to score at least twice in the return leg. Tonight, Arsene Wenger faces the club that give him his chance in football management. Arsenal take on Monaco at the Emirates, and after two decades in North London, our reporter Ben Smith has been back to where it all began for Wenger. Arsene Who was the headline in 1996. Well, nearly 20 years later, Wenger is Arsenal’s longest-serving manager and their most successful. This journey to North London began in the south of France. I didn’t know how long I would be in thejob. It was mY long I would be in thejob. It was my first chance to be at a big club. I was very young. You are always grateful for that. I was very young. You are always gratefulfor that. On the south coast, Wenger is revered for the trophies he won and the era of new French superstars he helped to usher in. Even as a young coach, he commanded respect. You can see the personality and the strong character. He is a coach who knows what he wants. In Monaco, one in three of the 36,000 residents are millionaires. If I cross over the road, I walk over the border and into France and that is where Monaco are determined to win the title once again. This will be an emotional first reunion for Wenger and Monaco. But come kick-off, there will be no room for sentiment. Davis Love III says he’s looking for peace and harmony in his Ryder Cup team after being confirmed as next year’s captain for the United States. The USA made the headlines for arguments within the team last time, and Love wants a different atmosphere at Hazeltine in Minnesota. And some news in this lunchtime. England full-back Mike Brown has been ruled out of Sunday’s Six Nations match in Ireland. That’s all sport for now. Back to you, jane. A former US marine has been sentenced to life in prison, after being convicted of murdering the US Navy Seal whose story inspired the film American Sniper. Eddie Ray Routh shot dead Chris Kyle, and another man, at a shooting range in Texas two years ago. The film based on Chris Kyle’s memoirs was nominated at the Oscars this weekend. Alistair Leathead reports from Los Angeles. There was no question over what Eddie Ray Routh did two years ago. It was just a question of whether he was, as his lawyers argued, insane and suffering psychosis at the time. The jury spent just two hours deliberating an answer before giving their statement to the judge to read out. We, thejury, find the defendant, Eddie Ray Routh, guilty of the felony offence of capital murder as charged. There was little reaction from Routh to the verdict. The jury agreed with the prosecutor that the killings at a Texas shooting range were cold, calculated capital murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. They were trying to kill our soldiers... Bradley Cooper plays Chris Kyle in American Sniper, Clint Eastwood’s Oscar-winning film based on his autobiography. The former Navy SEAL was a US war hero who killed a record number of enemy combatants in four deployments to Iraq. But he suffered personally and was helping other veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. He and his friend Chad Littlefield were trying to help Routh and took him to the shooting range where they were killed. The Littlefield family gave their response to the verdict outside the court. We just want to say that we’ve waited two years for God to getjustice for us on behalf of our son and, as always, God has proved to be faithful and we’re so thrilled that we have the verdict that we have tonight. Two years after murdering the American sniper, Eddie Ray Routh will now spend the rest of his life in prison. Alastair Leithead, BBC News, Los Angeles. Time for a look at the weather. Here’sjay Wynne. Hello. Good afternoon. There is a lot going on over the next few days, a very changeable spell of weather. A warm front moving in today will make things milder. With every change, you can expect some rain to Ci’13I’1gâ, YOU CSI’] expect SOTTIE I’3iIâ1 to TTIOVE change, you can expect some rain to move through. For the rest of the day today, it is turning that bit milder. We will get to II or I2 degrees down towards Plymouth. It is grey, some fog over the hills as well. Further east, it is that bit brighter, a bit of sunshine, and temperatures will probably rise a bit as we get on through the afternoon. Further west, we have a lot more cloud, some rain, some fog over the hills, and some snow over the higher ground of Scotland. The winds will be picking up here as well. Now, as we go on through the afternoon, into the evening, this band of rain is a warm front which will continue tojourney band of rain is a warm front which will continue to journey eastwards. So we will see some rain. The cold front follows on behind. It is more active. A spell of wind and rain for Scotland and Northern Ireland, pushing down into England and Wales by dawn. We are in this wedge of warm air across England and Wales. That will be the key feature of things tomorrow, a spell of wet and windy weather sweeps southwards. Most of the rain in the morning. Notice quite a lot of showers into Scotland and Northern Ireland. Temperatures will be dropping away all the while through the afternoon. So, turning increasingly cold. Then through the evening, it stays windy in the north and the west and we have lots of showers to come. Those will be wintry down to lower and lower levels. There is a risk of ice anywhere from Northern England northwards by dawn on Friday. So, a chilly start to Friday. A decent sort of day for much of England and Wales, particularly for central and eastern areas, that is where the best of the brighter weather will be. Showers into Scotland where it is quite windy. We have some rain waiting in the wings, which will be a feature of things on Friday night into Saturday. So quite an unsettled look to the weekend. It will be windy. Increasingly windy with spells of rain at time. Expect some rain this weekend. Probably not raining all day everywhere. Temperatures dropping away in the north and the west and those winds really picking up as well. There is a lot going on over the next few days. Keep an eye on the forecast. Now a reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Greater Manchester is to become the first English region given full control over health spending. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Alex Bushill. A needle exchange in Soho has told BBC London that more young men in the capital are using anabolic steroids than ever before. The South Westminster Drug and Alcohol Service - which runs the capital’s only specialist clinic - says those using performance enhancing drugs are getting younger and younger. Emilia Papadopoulos reports. At the height of his career in the ‘90s Greg Valentino had the world’s biggest biceps. With a circumference of 28 inches, these were the result of hard core steroid abuse. But it is notjust body- builders using performance enhancing drugs any more. City worker Andy has taken steroids for two years. He buys them from a dealer at his local gym. I started taking them because I felt I could not get any bigger training naturally. It was the next step for me. There is immense pressure to look good, it is part of the culture we live in. Andy, do you know any other people that take these? I know quite a few and they do not regret taking them either. They all want that big figure. Definitely our numbers are increasing. On a regular basis. I’ve been working with steroid users for about 16 years and when I first started working with them, guys were normally in their late 30s, a traditional body-builder. Now the average age is about 23. Anabolic steroids are class C drugs, they can be inhaled or taken as tablets. And there ae almost 100 types. While it is illegal to sell or distribute them, using them is not against the law. And they’re not hard to get hold of. An online search for ""buy steroids London"" brings up more than half a million results. Steroids might enhance performance and make muscles grow bigger, faster. But there is a list of potential side-effects, from hair loss and acne to depression, liver and heart problems. I think of it as a supplement. I use it with my protein shakes. Ido not think of it being a drug even though I know it is. The Department of Health told us it recognises steroid use is rising and it is giving local more funding to help tackle the issue. However if users like Andy remain casual about the side-effects, the problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. You can see more on that report this evening, when we hear from a mother of a teenager who died after taking steroids. That at 6.30pm this evening. Firefighters from across London have gone on strike this morning. The last strike was injune of last year. There will be a skeleton service run by private contractors across the capital. The Fire Brigade union says 5,500 firefighters have gone on strike this morning. The Government has said the strike action is unnecessary. Safer Travel At Night stopped and checked minicabs and taxis. London’s cyclists were involved in 12 road accidents every day over a four-year period, according to new research. Analysis of data sent to the police found that the worst hotspot for cyclists was the Elephant and Castle roundabout, followed by Trafalgar Square and Waterloo Road roundabout. The one thing we found is that two-thirds of the accidents that we looked at that had serious injuries in 2013 involved either heavy goods vehicles or vans, so the bigger the vehicle, the more vulnerable the cyclist is. Now it’s been feeling a little more mild today, so let’s get the weather with Kate. Good afternoon. Well after this morning’s rain it is an improving picture. We had quite a lot of cloud around, but we are starting to see it thin so we are having some bright spells through the afternoon. Certainly a drier picture as we head through the afternoon. Starting to feel a little milder. When we get the breaks in the cloud it is actually going to feel very pleasant. The temperatures could get around ten, maybe 11 degrees in central London. The cloud will start to thicken as we head into the evening and that ",,

Decisions about £6 billion worth of health and social care spending will rest with local politicians and clinicians from next year. We also want to have people in Manchester having greater control over their own affairs and we want social care and the NHS brought closer together. social care and the NHS brought closertogether. It closer together. It is a very exciting development. I am a bit worried because it does point to further break-up of the idea of a National Health Service. The Government’s released few details as yet, but we’ll be looking at how the Manchester plan could work. Also tonight: Infuriated by nuisance calls and texts? From next year, it’ll be easier to prosecute the companies that make them. South Yorkshire Police say the investigation into Cliff Richard has increased significantly and involves more than one allegation.

The verdict on neighbourhood teams by an internal police review seen by this programme. Figures show two cyclists have collisions every single hour in the capital. That is one suggestion to help tackle bed blocking. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. £6 billion a year of health spending is to be handed to Greater Manchester. It is the first English region to get full control of a merged health and social care budget from April next year. The Chancellor, George Osborne, has described it as a really exciting development. The independent health body, The King’s Fund, says it would be reform on a breathtaking scale but risks yet another NHS reorganisation. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, is in Salford taking a closer look at the plans. Making Manchester a northern powerhouse, the Chancellor’s plan to give the region more economic clout and control over public spending. Now it will involve handing over the full health budget. We have a National Health Service with a national mandate and national targets but we also want people in Manchester with greater control over their own affairs and we want to bring social care on the NHS closer together. It is a very exciting development. It involves bringing together social care with the NHS. The first time it has been done on this scale in England. In one part of Greater Manchester, they are already discussing bringing health and social care together talks are being held with the local council and other organisations about moving towards a genuinely integrated care system for adults. Now the idea will be extended and patients like what they hear. It is easy sometimes to pass it on and let someone else deal with it. If theyjoin it up, they are dealing with each other and then it becomes a better system. It is easier for people to be dealt with under one roof than having to go to different places. Under this ambitious plan for Greater Manchester, there will be a £6 billion budget. Ten local councils working with local NHS leaders will run health and social care together. It will cover 2.7 million people. This Stockport GP who runs a local health commissioning group is enthusiastic. The opportunity to provide better care and safer care is now ours to deliver on. It is a huge opportunity to achieve something that the NHS and social care have never achieved since the inception of the NHS. But if Manchester is given control over health spending, Labour wants to know what it will mean for the rest of the NHS. This has to be a solution that works for everywhere. If you are going to stick to the idea of a National Health Service, you cannot have a Swiss cheese NHS were some bits of the system operates to different rules or have different powers and freedoms. Health analysts say there are many unanswered questions. The plans are welcome but we need to be clear who will be accountable for the funds under the partnership arrangements and whether they can be implemented without a distracting reorganisation. Northern Ireland has already done it and Scotland is planning it. The big challenge for Greater Manchester is to make health and social care integration work. This is a tremendously ambitious plan and the devil will be in the detail. Yes, it is extremely ambitious. You have got central money being handed over to Greater Manchester. Adding to what is already controlled locally by health commissioning groups and GP Klima and so on. It is a really significant move on top of the volution announcements, handing control of volution announcements, handing control of areas like transport to Greater Manchester. Then you have theissue Greater Manchester. Then you have the issue of health and social care integration which is big stuff. Northern Ireland has been doing it for a few decades and it has not always been straightforward. Greater Manchester will involve more people and a bigger budget than Northern Ireland. Health professionals say it is the big prize, making health and social care work together, much more beneficial for patients, particularly the elderly. We need a lot more detail to be clear how it will work and we are promised that at the end of the week. Thank you. It’ll soon be easier to prosecute and fine companies that bombard people with cold calling and nuisance texts. At the moment, regulators have little power to take on the companies, even though 175,000 people made complaints last year. But from April, firms could face fines of up to £500,000. Our business correspondent, Emma Simpson, reports. The curse of the cold call, millions of us get bombarded at home and on the move. Martin, a retired civil servant, for him, they are never-ending. At the moment, I get three orfour calls a never-ending. At the moment, I get three or four calls a day. It is a real intrusion. Interrupts real intrusion. Interru pts everything. real intrusion. Interrupts everything. Although superficially everything. Although su perficially it everything. Although superficially it is just a moment avoiding everything. Although superficially it isjust a moment avoiding doing the things you are doing, it can be risky because sometimes I am doing something difficult or dangerous. That is despite the fact Martin signed up to the scheme that is supposed to stop unwanted calls. This could be the second unsolicited call I have had today. I was just about to do some filming when this happened. I kid you not. All of your debt written off for free. Press five now. She hasjust hung up on me. Last year there were more than 175,000 complaints to the regulator about nuisance calls and texts. The Government says it is clamping down. It is lowering the burden of proof for prosecuting nuisance callers. Companies could face fines of up to £500,000 and the Government wants to hold senior executives responsible for unwanted calls and texts main by their firms for unwanted calls and texts main by theirfirms -- made by their for unwanted calls and texts main by their firms -- made by their firms. If they were only fined if they were substantial damage under stress in the past, they thought, we could get away with it. Now it is an offence just doing it. Many people think the Government could do more, including the body representing legitimate companies. The displaying of the caller identification to help identify these companies and there needs to be more effort by the telecoms companies and the regulator to try to track down from a technical perspective the calls being made from overseas. It is certainly not the end of the line for cold callers, but come April, it will be easier to punish the companies who break the law. South Yorkshire Police say their investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has ""increased significantly in size"" and involves ""more than one allegation"". The 7lI-year-old singer was interviewed last year following claims of sex abuse involving a young boy. june Kelly is here. This hasjust broken in the last half hour. What more can you tell us? A bit of background. It emerged last summer that Sir Cliff Richard was under investigation over one allegation of historical sexual offence. The claim was he had sexually assaulted a boy and a 16th at a rally by the American evangelist Billy Graham in Sheffield in 1985. Cliff Richard was interviewed under caution at the time by detectives in South Yorkshire. He vehemently denied the allegation, describing it as completely false. In the past hour, it has emerged they are investigating more allegations. The confirmation came in a letterfrom the Chief Constable to the chairman of parliament’s Home Affairs Select Committee. The Chief Constable is saying it is an investigation which has increased significantly in size since the inception and Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers are aware. We have had a statement from the singer himself. He says, I have no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from. The police have not disclosed details to me. I have never assaulted anyone and I remain confident the truth will prevail. Thanks very much for that. More now on the three missing schoolgirls from East London who are now believed to have joined Islamic State extremists in Syria. The BBC learnt they had been smuggled across the Turkish border in the south of the country several days ago. Our correspondent, james Reynolds, has spoken to one people smuggler who told him how the girls were taken across the border. Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana got themselves into Syria with the help of smugglers. Those smugglers have worked out how to operate in this, and increasingly dangerous and ungoverned border zone. They sharing summation with one another. We have spoken to one smuggler who does not want to be shown. He did not get the girls into Syria himself but he claims he has learnt the details of how they got across. Did you meet the girls? TRANSLATION: The Isis member smuggled them into Syria. He works with us. I showed him the picture of the girls on my phone. He told me four orfive days ago the girls on my phone. He told me four or five days ago they entered Syria and joint Isis. They are from Britain. You showed this picture to your contact who smuggled them across and he confirmed that he saw this girl wearing glasses? He saw this one but those two had their faces covered. How easy would it have been for the person you know to take three British schoolgirls across the border without being caught by the Turkish authorities? 75% of the local district border is controlled by Isis. The Turks are scared of Isis and the route is under Isis control. How would the girls have been taken across? In a car? on foot? In a car. Theyjumped from the cart and across into Syria. I know the car and I know the driver and I know his name and I know the colour of the car. The girls get to the border fence, what happens on the other side when they get into Syria? The distance is not far. As soon as they cross into the Isis held area, Isis members were waiting for them. That is one account. But eight days after they left Gatwick, we have yet to hear from the girls themselves. The chief executive of HSBC has told MPs that the recent tax scandal at the bank was unacceptable, regrettable and had damaged HSBC’s reputation. Earlier this month, it emerged that the Swiss arm of HSBC helped wealthy clients evade hundreds of millions of pounds in taxes. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, reports. Minds have already been made up after renovations HSBC helped customers evade taxes. Today the men at the head of the bank made an appearance in the court of public opinion. Westminster. The chief executive told MPs he was sorry. I would like to put on the record an apology from both myself and from Douglas for the unacceptable events that took place in our private bank in Switzerland in the mid-2000s. It is an apology we want to make to you, our customers, shareholders, the public at large. Alongside him, the chairman who has held a senior position in the bank since the 1990s. It is completely unacceptable that some people are buried the law and others do not. I pay all of my tax and I find and others do not. I pay all of my tax and Ifind it tax and I find it abhorrent that others do not. Both men insisted the Swiss bank had changed and that it would be a red flag now if customers try to take out millions of pounds in unmarked cash. I have come out of the evidence session by Stuart Gulliver and Douglas Flint at the Palace of Westminster. There was certainly an apology, contrition, but what might frustrate MPs was there was no individual responsibility taken for the problems HSBC has faced across its business. Following the bankers, the turn of the head of the UK’s Revenue and Customs. She said there would be meetings next week with the Serious Fraud Office and police to look at whether criminal action was possible. We can share the stolen HSBC Swiss data with the law enforcement agencies and regulators for the pursuit of wider offences. The bankers left in blacked out cars after a sobering day of apologies. Caught on camera, it might be a while before we see them in public again. Our top story this evening. Greater Manchester is to become the first English region given full control of its health spending. And still to come. The secret role of the Natural History Museum in the Second World War. Later on BBC London. The extreme use of steroids. Concern over the number of people using the drugs in the capital’s gyms. Intelligence but not as we know it. The Google computers playing computer games better than humans. A BBC poll suggests that almost half of Britain’s Muslims feel the country is becoming less tolerant of them. 1,000 Muslims were surveyed over the last month to try and gauge their response to the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris last month in which seven people were killed by Islamist extremists. 68% oppose use of violence against those who publish images of the Prophet Muhammad. Two thirds said they oppose the use of violence against people who publish images of the Prophet Muhammad. 27% had some sympathy for the motives behind Charlie Hebdo attack. Almost all those questioned, 95% said they felt a loyalty to Britain. Our correspondent Sima Kotecha reports from Bradford. Bradford. Home to more than 100,000 Muslims. Most are of Pakistani origin. But, it is this country they call home. A group of college students having some time off before lectures. Like many here, they feel a strong loyalty to Britain. I’m a very proud British Muslim as much as I love Islam, I love Britain itself because of the culture and diversity is immense. Especially where we live in Bradford itself. But a new poll found almost half of Britain’s Muslims feel this country is becoming less tolerant of them. Islamophobia is making it a difficult place in which to live. It angers me because I was born here. I am as much British as any other white person who lives in this country. These Muslim British women are passionate about their faith. They believe the media’s fuelling prejudice. I feel whenever there’s an issue, a crime an an example, the media’s very quick to highlight that ~ I can’t understand the logic behind that. Muslims here say they are being unfairly scrutinised. They are being branded as extremists. They say they should not have to apologise for a minority of fundamentalists. The poll was conducted in the weeks following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Two thirds of Muslims surveyed said violence against those who publish pictures the profit can never be justified. Murder is not the answer, never the answer. I am completely against it. People should not be meddling in the name of Islam. just over one quarter said they had some sympathy for the motives behind the attacks. They know how much we love our profit. If they didn’t put that photo out... It was just our profit. If they didn’t put that photo out... It wasjust poking fun, wasn’t it? It’s not poking fun, though. Fun, to limit, but not the profit. I disagree with anybody dying, 100%, nobody deserves to die, but it would not have happened if people didn’t put that photo out. That’s what I believe. They were provoking it. That’s what they got. This soup kitchen is run by a group of Muslim volunteers. They say it shows how integrated the community is. The vast majority of Muslims are peace-loving, you know, doing their best to help their neighbours, to fit into society, to integrate. But some from the younger generation are struggling to mix. It is a concern for me when people say what is the point in engaging in British society when often we are attacked and feel marginalised? It creates apathy and, secondly, you don’t know what it can lead to. The poll paints a picture of British Muslims embracing British life. Some argue to live here peacefully it must be a two-way street. Integration on their part and acceptance by the rest of the UK. And you can get a full breakdown of the poll’s findings online at bbc.co.uk/news. The driver of a bin lorry which crashed in Glasgow killing six people will not be persecuted. He is understood to have been unconscious when his lorry careered out of control. james, fatal accident enquiry has now been launched. What more can you tell us about that? Well, Fiona, as you say, it was before Christmas and this street was packed with Christmas shoppers when the bin lorry travelled about 300 metres down the street before ending UP metres down the street before ending up against the wall here just in front of dream Street Station. The police investigated that straightaway, the file was passed to the prosecution service, the Crown Office in Scotland, who have now decided that they should be no criminal charges against the driver. Norwill there criminal charges against the driver. Nor will there be any receding for breaches of health and safety against Glasgow City Council, which operated this bin lorry. The Crown Office said I can’t comment on suggestions driver might have a heart attack, but that will now be part of a fatal accident enquiry which relatives say they hope will take place as soon as possible. james, in Glasgow, thank you. Researchers from some of the world’s top universities have joined forces to try to put a value on the world’s nature reserves and parks. They attract eight billion visits per year. The research suggests the economic benefit of these open spaces far outweighs the amount spent protecting them. And calls for more money to be invested in them. Our Correspondent Claire Marshall sent this report from the Peak District. It’s the excitement of such a different view. This morning, these children were in Sheffield, now they are in the Peak District National Park. How have you found it being out and about in the countryside? Really calm and relaxing. I like the country because you have the wind blowing and you can just go on walks UP blowing and you can just go on walks up the hill. And see Rivers. Has it made you want to come back and be outdoors? Yes, a lot. Our partner the national treasures but according to today’s report, they need much more funding and it’s notjust the UK. The research shows that there are 8 billion visits worldwide to protected national areas and these could generate revenues of up to £388 billion but less than 6 billion is spent on safeguarding such sites. Nature reserves benefit people in all sorts of other ways as well. In terms of soaking up calm and the climate and absorbing floodwaters and reducing risks of flooding downstream is, so there’s all sorts of benefits. This isjust one. The budget at the park has been cut by 30% over the last four years. This is one of the most popular trails National Park, each year hundreds of thousands of people come and enjoy it, but there is no central government money to set it up and now there is none for maintenance. Its expense of now it’s down to the park authority to find the money. It costs money to run parks like this. This is the responsibility of a chief executive. How have you had to adapt a falling income? There is a consequence of having less funding and we have had to lose people. We are focusing on how we can deliver as much with what we have and look at opportunities for bring in income. This report asks the question got home do you put a price on nature and who should pay? They were known as Churchill’s Secret Army. Agents from the Special Operations Executive who worked behind enemy lines during the Second World War. Tonight some of the few surviving veterans are gathering for a dinner to mark the organisation’s 75th anniversary. Our Security Correspondent Gordon Corera has been catching up with some of the veterans. Usually home to dinosaurs, the Natural History Museum seems an unlikely place to host a dinner for veterans of wartime sabotage. Today, this is the mammal gallery, but during the war, it was top-secret station 15 B. These pictures show how it was used to display gadgets like booby traps and exploding turnips for SOE agents. Some of the devices hidden in everyday items can now be seen in the Imperial War Museum. This catalogue describes just some of the gadgets that SOE used in the war ranging from concealed radios and weapons to exploding rats and cowpats that could blow up German armoured vehicles. This dramatisation made just after the war but featuring real agents gives a feel for their work. A 92-year-old American, over Ao nights dinner, is one of those who parachuted behind enemy lines in France. Well, we accomplished our missions, we made it unpleasant for the Germans, so unpleasant that they actually withdrew from our department. Back in Britain, radio operators were vital to keep in touch with agents in the field. I dreamt in Morse code. In London’s rather exclusive special forces club, one operator recalls a run-up to D-Day. Wejust got club, one operator recalls a run-up to D-Day. We just got a very, club, one operator recalls a run-up to D-Day. Wejust got a very, very busy. With the message coming in, they were blowing up bridges from the South of France on the western side. Once the tourists have gone, 1+0 nights dinner, the gadgets will be on display one more time. Although the veterans will have to do check-in their cloaks and daggers at the door. Time now for a look at the weather. Milder, didn’t it? 11+ degrees in South Wales but it’s been a roller-coaster ride and that’s the way it will remain because temperatures will dip tomorrow. We have a north-westerly, nearer 7 degrees, Polly going to stay at that mark on Friday, as well. -- probably. The first weather front not producing much rain but the next one, the cold front, much more active. The rain will be heavy in northern Ireland and Scotland. In between, the last of the cold air, double figures in England and Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland, it turns colder but at least early in the morning we should have some sunshine in between the showers. A wet start around the borders. Heavy rain in the north-west of England and very little rain the other side of the Pennines for the rush hour but a wet start and a windy start across Wales and the south-west of England. Not much rain through the Midlands, the south-east, but it will be very misty with some extensive hill fog around, too. A great start. Through the day, the rain, still heavy, at times, will go to the south-east, not clearing until probably early afternoon. Away from here, the sunshine streaming down on the north-westerly wind, showers in the north-west increasingly wintry over the hills and it will feel colder. 5-6. In the north-west, this is where we will have some icy patches around overnight and into Friday. A chilly start, eastern areas, dry and bright with some sunshine. Further west, clouding over with signs of more rain. Changeable weather. Overthe weekend, spells of rain, the heaviest on Saturday night, where it will turn rather windy. It will be cooler after that with some showers. That is all from us. Goodbye from me. Tonight on BBC London News. Overstretched and less visible. The verdict on neighbourhood teams by an internal police review seen by this programme. They are no longer policing the streets as they should be. They have an increased workload which means they are now more often behind the desk than out on the street. Scotland Yard insists the new system is driving down crime down in the capital. Also tonight. Every hour, two cyclists are involved in collisions on London’s roads. The Wimbledon mechanic who says it’s a miracle he’s alive after his heart was punctured by an axel grinder. All I could see was just the hole, no blood, but I could feel that something was quite seriously wrong. From Paloma Faith to Sam Smith, the London musicians hoping for a win at tonight’s Brit Awards. Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. First tonight. A review of the biggest shake-up to policing in the capital has found that local officers are overstretched and less visible in the communities they’re supposed to serve. Faced with huge budget cuts, two years ago the Met transformed its neighbourhood teams. The internal report seen by this programme says changes are needed to make it work better for Londoners. Scotland Yard and City Hall have told us the new policing model is helping to reduce crime. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Nick Beake has this exclusive report. Islington this lunchtime and white smoke is filling a supermarket. Neighbourhood officers who had been on patrol nearby try to work out what has happened. We are told it is down to a faulty smoke machine which is supposed to stop intruders. This upon my work is what many Londoners say they want to see the Met doing. But local policing has and gone a huge shake-up because of cuts. There were six people in every team. Now, it’sjust two. But were six people in every team. Now, it’s just two.

An internal report seen by BBC London has found that this new way of policing London’s communities has reduced crime and boosted confidence. But there is concern that many Londoners are not seen their police out and about in the way that the idea.

The worst place for collisions is here, Elephant and Castle roundabout. Obviously, it is dangerous. I think it would be good if they redesigned it. It’s such a major thoroughfare if you’re going anywhere in south London. As well as Elephant and Castle, other blackspots are Trafalgar Square, Waterloo Road and the Lambeth Bridge Roundabout. Analysis of police data shows that there is a cycling collision every two hours across London. I think they should make those junctions far clearer for cyclists and for motorists so we can protect the cyclist on the road from the vehicles. There’s a lot that can be done and lots that is being done, but we just need to do it quicker and get cyclists protected. This insurance company also looked at its top 100 claims for cycling collisions across the UK. Of those, 64 were commuters, 37 involved vans, 35 involved HGVs. Of the incidents that took place at night, it’s claimed that 33% of the cyclists did not have lights. Work has started to create safer segregated cycle lanes. This is Mile End. Today, it’s emerged, though, that this year there has also been an underspend again in London’s cycling budget. Some have concerns about the rate of progress. You are looking at a huge underspend potentially again. Why is this and why aren’t you able to get the money out the door to be spent on these cycling projects that London wants and the boroughs want to progress? You do have to be mindful of the fact that there is a lot of controversy attending these things. There are all sorts of people who either don’t want them or don’t want them in the particularform in which we have designed them. I think we are going the right way. Campaigners say, statistically, cycling isn’t dangerous. They also say safer roads can’t come quickly enough. Photographs of seven men, thought to be Chelsea fans, have been released by police investigating racist chanting at St Pancras Station. It happened last Wednesday, 24 hours after a similar incident on the Paris Metro involving Chelsea fans. Police say anyone who can identify the men should come forward. A double decker bus crashed into a bus stop in Tottenham this morning but fortunately no one was injured. Transport for London said there the incident which happened on Broad Lane just after 11 am. Scotlan Yard said the bus driver was being checked over. The Prime Minister has been urged to set up an inquiry into the the events surrounding the three girls from East London who are now believed to be in Syria. Speaking in Parliament, Rushnara Ali, the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow asked for the inquiry to ensure schools, families and mosques are better guided as to how they can protect young people. What I have done is ask the Home Secretary to look urgently with the Transport Secretary at all the protocols we have in place about young people, about travelling and what airlines do and what we can do. My understanding is that the police did respond relatively quickly in terms of informing the Turkish authorities and what the Turkish deputy prime minister has said about a three day delay is not accurate. The Mayor of Tower Hamlets has told the High Court he wanted to be elected freely and fairly on the basis of his decency and character. Lutfur Rahman was concluding his evidence after four days before a special election court where he’s been accused of electoral fraud. Our political editor Tim Donovan has been following the story and can tell us more. Yes, for three days, he had Yes, forthree days, he had been cross-examined by the barrister representing four local people in Tower Hamlets, petitioners who were trying to get lost’s election overturned. Today was his chance to answer questions from his own barrister, to put the record straight the way he sees it. Last year’s election victory was entirely jet it. Did you break every rule in the book? No. Eg use bribery to win? No. Iwanted the book? No. Eg use bribery to win? No. I wanted to win and I did win fairly and freely. I wanted support for my decency and my character. He said there had been smears and false allegations, but not one allegation had been proved. What about the claim that he improperly got religious leaders to support him? This was a claim that he had persuaded 100 Imams to support him. Wielding undue spiritual influence was the claim. He said that was absolutely not the case. Religion was important to him personally, but he would never have used religion in this way. Besides, no imam would have been able to persuade people to vote like this. Did he say anything about his political future? There was one insight into the political complexities here. He was askedif political complexities here. He was asked if there was any chance of reconciliation with the Labour Party. He stood and one last year as an independent, having been expelled from Labour. He revealed that there had been discussions since he won last year about being reunited with Labour, coming back into the party. But these proceedings have put a stop to that. Thank you. A man whose heart was pierced in three places when an angle grinder fired into his chest has praised the medical team who saved his life. Mark McOuoid from Wimbledon has been told it’s a miracle he survived after doctors performed surgery normally carried out on teenage victims of stabbings. Sonja jessup has been to meet him. This ‘s piece in the centre was weird it penetrated my heart. They had to open up my chest to get to my heart. Mark is still coming to terms of how close he came to death. He was helping fit a door frame when the angle grinder he was using backfired into his chest. There was a hole the size of my finger, a little hole in the centre of my chest, no blood. But I could feel that something was quite serious. It was very serious. Doctors realised they had just minutes to save his life. Be cut between the ribs from side to side and open the chest up. He had three small holes in his heart. Our cardiothoracic colleagues were able to sort those holes up. Normally these procedures are carried out on teenage victims of stabbings. But this is the first time a patient has survived. just five years ago, Mark would probably have died. By having this network in London, starting with the Ambulance Service, all the way through to discharge, these other guys we are trying to save. His 15-year-old daughter thinks it is our medical. She is now thinking about a career as a nurse on a paramedic. Mark does not know whether he can go back to hisjob restoring classic cars. But he does know that without a quick thinking medical team, he does know that without a quick thinking medicalteam, he would he does know that without a quick thinking medical team, he would not be here to do. Without all those people, I would be here to do. Without all those people, Iwould not people, I would not be here now. I would just be another statistic. Still to come. Intelligence, but not as we know it. Up for awards at the Brits. We’re on the red carpet talking to favourite to win best female There’s concern over the number of young men in the capital using anabolic steroids. The performance enhancing drugs aren’t illegal to take, but there can be serious side effects. The Home Office estimates that 60,000 people in the UK have used the drugs but the heath watchdog claims the true figure is far higher. And BBC London has found evidence to suggest that steroid use is happening here in the capital’s gyms. Emilia Papadopolous reports. At the height of his career in the '90s, Greg Valentino had the world’s biggest biceps. With a circumference of 28 inches, these were the result of hard-core steroid abuse. But it’s not just bodybuilders using dI’UgS any ITIOI’â. City worker Andy has taken steroids for two years. He buys them from a dealer at his local gym. I started taking them because I felt I could not get any bigger training naturally. It was the next step for me. There is immense pressure to look good, it’s part of the culture we live in. Andy, do you know any other people that take them? Yes, I know quite a few and they don’t regret taking them either. Here, for example, is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars when the movie first came out in 1980. And here is the same Luke Skywalker when the movie was reissued in the mid-1990s. Young men turning to steroids appears to be a growing trend in the capital. One needle exchange in Soho said it is seeing more steroid users than ever before. Definitely, our numbers are increasing on a regular basis. I have been working with steroid users for about 16 years and when I first started working with them, guys were normally in their late 30s, bodybuilders. Now the average age is about 23. Anabolic steroids are class C drugs. They can be injected or taken as tablets and there are almost 100 different types. While it is illegal to sell or distribute them, using them is not against the law and they are not hard to get hold of. An online search for buy steroids London brings up more than half a million results. The Home Office estimates that 60,000 people in the UK used steroids last year. But the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says the figure is likely to be three times that number. Because of the problem, the health watchdog advised gyms to provide sharps bins for the safe disposal of needles as part of new guidelines last year. We would say that is an important thing to day. The focus of the guideline is about reducing harm, reducing risk of infection. Easy Gym told us they have installed sharps bins in all of their gyms. Virgin Active, Fitness First and David Lloyd said some of their clubs also have them. All the gyms said they have a zero tolerance approach to steroids, and the bins are a health and safety measure for diabetic members and the disposal of razors. However, BBC London has seen used syringes disposed of in several gyms around the capital. Steroids might enhance performance and make muscles grow bigger, faster, but there is a list of potential side-effects from hair loss and acne to depression, liver and heart problems. For 17-year-old Matthew Deere from Southend, the side-effects were fatal. He had an adverse reaction to the anabolic steroid that he was taking. The good thing is that we are actually talking about it now. When we lost Matthew nearly six years ago, a lot of people were hoping that this was a problem that was not going to boil over and I think we are at that point where we are boiling over. The Department of Health told us they know that steroid use is rising and it is giving local authorities more funding to help tackle the issue. But if users like Andy remain casual about the side-effects, the problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. The Brit Music Awards get underway injust over an hour’s time with Londoners Lily Allen and Paloma Faith among the nominees. But with three Grammys already under his belt, there’s talk of singer Sam Smith who’s been nominated for five awards possibly stealing the show. We can cross to Greenwich and join Sangita Myska who’s at the 02 ahead of tonight’s ceremony. The stars have been coming along the red carpet thick and fast. But the man of the moment is undoubtedly Sam Smith and he is here with us live. Hello, everyone. How excited must you be. It is very weird. Five nominations. Four Grammys. Is the pressure on? Truly, I believe that the whole point of making music and being an artist is selling albums and selling records is to do what I love, and that’s what I’m doing. Tonight is just a nice celebration. Some people here have had relatively quick success, but you have really grafted, done the work. Do you feel, as our result, it means a lot? Everything means more. It’s so important to have a job. I did these amazing things and I’m tired, and then I remember what I used to do, working in bars, not getting any breaks. And then I remember how lucky I am now. It looks really glamorous. It is. But it is very up and down all the time. Good luck to him. Now, did you play computer games in the 1980s and were you good at them? Because researchers working at the London headquarters of Google have developed an artificial intelligence system that’s learned how to play them far better than the best human players. Experts claim the flexibility of the system to learn complex strategies from scratch is a landmark achievement and a step towards developing human-like robots. Our Science Correspondent, Pallab Ghosh has the story. This is Breakout, a 1980s’ computer game. It’s being played by an artificial intelligence system. It’s received only one instruction - to win. Within hours, it outperforms the best human gamer. If it is an important event, it will record it in its memory and then replay it back hundreds of times while it’s learning so it can learn again from that particular episode. This system also learned how to play 48 other 1980s’ computer games including Space Invaders and Donkey Kong. The aim is to use such systems to make smart phones and other devices even smarter. For example, to recognise visual information and understand speech better than they do now. But ultimately, it could be used to develop robots that can think for themselves. It’s a development that prompted one of the world’s most respected scientists to issue this warning. I think the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it would take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever increasing rate. The man who developed the computer games system recognises its potential dangers. As with any new powerful technology, it can be used for good or for bad and we have got to make sure that we deploy this technology ethically and we use it for the good of society. This is obviously one man who can be relied upon not to stand on his partner’s feet. Robot assistance once seemed like science fiction. Now such a prospect does not seem too far away. Time for a check on the weather withjay Wynne. It was a nice day-to-day. I hope you made the most of it because tomorrow morning looks a bit different. We are going to see some rain through the morning. But that being is on the move and things should begin to brighten up in the afternoon. Let’s take a look at the big picture from today. There was some rain early on in the South East. But moved away. You can see this cloud to the north and west, this wedge of relatively mild in coming our way tonight. It will be cloudy overnight. Dab and drizzly as well, but very mild. 9-10 degrees. A little bit of rain early on, but that moves away. Foggy over the hills. But mid-morning, we will see the rain coming in from the north and west and that could be quite heavy and blustery. Come the afternoon, most of the rain has cleared away towards the East and things begin to brighten up. There may be some cloud around, but some spells of sunshine should develop. But those temperatures will drop away through the afternoon. A cold feel to things. Tomorrow evening, clear skies, allowing temperatures to drop away. A touch of frost. 9-10 degrees one morning, down to freezing the next morning. Friday should be a decent day. Cloud amounts will increase in the afternoon and that it should stay dry. Forthe afternoon and that it should stay dry. For the weekend, it looks as if it will board downhill with an area of low pressure bringing wind and brain. Temperatures up and down over the next few days. Friday I decent day. Saturday cloudy and Wendy. Blustery showers by Sunday. Thank you. The main headlines. Councils in Greater Manchester are to be the first in England to be given control over NHS spending in their area. The plan will come into force from April next year. The Government’s introducing new rules to make it easier to prosecute companies responsible for nuisance phone calls. At the moment, the calls must be proved to have caused substantial damage or distress. The Chief Executive of HSBC, Stuart Gulliver, has apologised for wrongdoing at its Swiss private bank, which is embroiled in allegations that it helped clients to evade taxes. He was appearing before MPs. An internal police review seen by this programme says London’s new neighbourhood policing teams are not visible enough to the public and are being diverted to other duties too often. Scotland Yard says the new model is helping to reduce crime. And London’s cyclists were involved in a road accident every two hours over a four year period. Figures also show that there are more collisions at Elephant and Castle roundabout than anywhere else. That’s it, thanks forjoining us. Asad Ahmad will be back with our late news and plenty more of course on our website. From me and the team here, have a lovely evening. Bye for now. You’re going to hear a lot of claims about the economy in this election and sometimes it’s hard to tell fact from fiction. A Labour government would make different choices, making sure it’s the everyday families that benefit from the recovery... ..your family, your children’s education, your healthcare. This is a plan for the future that will unlock the potential of our economy, a plan based on the simple truth that Britain succeeds when working families succeed. Labour will balance the books and do it fairly by cutting the deficit every year, reversing the Tory tax break for millionaires, clamping down on tax avoidance and making sure everyone plays by the same rules. Then it’s a pay rise for hardworking Britain, raising the minimum wage to £8 an hour, banning exploitative zero-hour contracts and making sure work pays more than welfare. A strong economy needs the right immigration controls, new laws to stop employers undercutting wages by exploiting workers... ..and stopping people claiming benefits until they have been here for at least two years. This country’s future will depend on giving the next generation the skills they need, bringing down class sizes for infants to no more than 30 and ensuring every teacher in every school is properly qualified. Every young person that gets the grades should have a direct route to an apprenticeship, and every firm with a major government contract must take on apprentices. A successful economy depends on the jobs created by small businesses, so Labour will cut and then freeze business rates and reform the banks to back Britain’s businesses. The Labour Party stands for a better future for you, your family and the next generation of this country, because Britain does well when working people do well.

Fresh revelations about jimmy Savile and his links with Stoke Mandeville. A new report reveals the scale of his abuse at the hospital. He assaulted women and children on hospital premises. Some victims say staff did nothing to help. Theyjust said they know he’s like that and ignore him, ignore him. And they just thought it was funny, really. We’ll be analysing. Also tonight. Greater Manchester will be the first English region to control all its health and social care spending, greatly extending its devolved powers. Bosses at HSBC apologise for what they call unacceptable practices which helped clients avoid tax and damaged their reputation. The police investigation into historical sexual offence allegations against Cliff Richard has been extended. And, Churchill’s Secret Army. A celebration of the forces who worked behind enemy lines in the Second World War. Overstretched and less visible. We reveal the verdict of an internal review of neighbourhood policing in the capital. And no pain no gain. The growing number of young men injecting steroids in pursuit of bigger bodies. Good evening. A report into links between jimmy Savile and Stoke Mandeville hospital is expected to say that the entertainer molested and abused dozens of women and children, on hospital premises. One of them as young as eight years old. The BBC has learned that the investigation, the findings of which will be published tomorrow, will say that there were warnings about his behaviour and that he was widely known among staff as a sex pest. Last summer, two investigations into 28 hospitals, including Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital, concluded that Savile had sexually assaulted staff and patients over three decades. Our home editor Mark Easton has this report. It’s about time you did something for me anyway because I’ve done something for you for... How was he allowed to get away with it? Over a period of 30 years, jimmy Savile was given almost unrestricted access to every area of Stoke Mandeville Hospital and exploited his extraordinary status to abuse dozens of sick children, vulnerable adults and staff. But the truly shocking revelation is that, despite numerous complaints, nothing was done to stop him. Among his many victims was this woman, she wasjust 18, in 1973, when Savile sexually assaulted her in her Stoke Mandeville hospital bed. My hands were bandaged and I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even walk very well. My pelvis had parted and I couldn’t walk very well either. So the person grabbed me and pulled me towards them and unfortunately they rammed their tongue down my throat. It was repulsive. It was horrible. The delayed report into Savile’s activities, here at Stoke Mandeville, will finally be published tomorrow, a document that beggars belief. It identifies more than 50 people he abused here, almost half of them children, the youngestjust eight. A formal complaint, made against Savile, should have seen him ejected from the hospital and reported to police, just one of ten occasions in which details of his sexual abuse were reported to staff. I told the nurses what Savile had done. Theyjust said they know he’s like that and ""ignore him, ignore him."" And, they just thought it was funny, really. The BBC understands the report will say Savile’s reputation BS B SEX pest WGS BI’! OpâI’I SâCIâât. Staff described him as creepy and a lecher who had access to the mortuary alone, out of hours. Time after time, concerns were either ignored or not passed on. How could we have allowed him to sit with our patients in the spinal unit, some of whom were paralysed from the neck down. Sit with them, without anybody bothering to ask what he was doing. Lawyers representing Savile’s victims say someone must be held to account. It will be a disgrace if the report into Stoke Mandeville reaches the same findings as it did in Leeds, that there was no accountability or knowledge within the senior management of the hospital because we have direct evidence that senior members of staff did know. Tomorrow’s report is not expected individually to censure any senior staff member although efforts have been made to trace managers. The idea that a respected hospital should harbour and facilitate a predatory sex offender is shocking enough, but the far greater scandal is that Savile’s celebrity status allowed him to continue his vile activities for decades, despite numerous for help. And Mark Easton is here. This isn’t the only report into Savile tomorrow? Know, in addition to the delayed Stoke Mandeville Hospital, three other delayed reports from three other hospitals he is known to have visited. Last summer we had 28 enquiry reports from hospitals including Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary which revealed widespread abuse byjimmy Savile and some of those hospitals may be updating their enquiry reports. It really does leave one shaking 1’s head in disbelief that this could happen over such a long period involving so many people and that’s why the most important report tomorrow is an independent report from the Department of Health on what’s called lessons learned and what seems to be clear if there was not a good communication between the front line, people being told all having ideas about his behaviour, and senior managers. I think the department are keen to try and learn lessons and ensure that this can never ever happen again. Mark, thank you. Greater Manchester is to become the first English region to take full control of its health and social care spending, with a budget of £6 billion. The Chancellor George Osborne described the move, which takes effect next year, as really exciting, but Labour said it risks creating a two-tier health system. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym reports. Making Manchester a Northern powerhouse. It’s the Chancellor’s plan to give the region more control over public spending. The latest surprise move, a handover of the full health budget. We have a National Health Service with a national mandate, national targets, free at the point of use, but we also want to have people in Manchester having greater control over their own affairs, and we want to bring social care in the NHS closer together, so it’s a very exciting development. The radical plan involves bringing together social care run by local authorities with the NHS. It already happens in Northern Ireland and will get under way this year in Scotland. Here in one part of Greater Manchester, at the hospital trust Salford Royal, there are already discussions about bring health and social care together. Talks are being held with the local council and other organisations about moving towards a genuinely integrated care system for adults. Now the idea will be extended and patients like what they hear. It’s easy sometimes to pass it on and let someone else deal with it. If theyjoin it all up, they are dealing with each other then and then it becomes a better system. It’s easier for people to be dealt with under one roof than having to go to different places. Under this ambitious plan for Greater Manchester there will be a £6 billion budget. Ten local councils working with local NHS leaders will run health and social care together. It will cover 2.7 million people across the region. This Stockport GP, who runs a local health commissioning group, is enthusiastic about what could be achieved. The opportunity to provide better care and safer care is now ours to deliver on. So it’s a huge opportunity to achieve something that the NHS and social care have never achieved since the inception of the NHS. But health analysts say there are many unanswered questions. These plans are welcomed but we need to be clear who will be accountable for £6 billion of NHS funds under this partnership arrangement. And whether they can be implimented without a distracting reorganisation. And if Manchester is given control over health spending, Labour want to know what it will mean for the rest of the NHS. This has to be a solution that works for everywhere or that can be offered to everywhere because if you’re going to stick to the idea of a National Health Service, you can’t have a Swiss cheese NHS where some bits of the system are operating to different rules or have different powers and freedoms. But with the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls suggesting he would support the Manchester integration idea, there was apparent uncertainty in Labour’s response. The plan, though, was unexpected and there’s still a lot more detail to come. Our deputy political editor james Landale is in Westminster. Potentially significant for the health service, of course, but huge political significance with all of this, as well? Yes, clearly the government supports this is a form on its merits and believes it will help people in Manchester with better social care. help people in Manchester with bettersocial care. But better social care. But the Conservatives also know it will help them politically, notjust that they can try and claim they are being more radical about health and social care, but also they will say this is shoving them supporting the north-west of England where, frankly, they need to get more votes. For Labour, though, it’s a challenge. They are divided on what should be a strong issue. The Labour leadership are exposed to this reform and say it’s a two tier system, potentially the end of a national service, and also save its funding crisis devolves, not resolved. On the other hand, senior Labour council leaders say this is exactly the kind of thing Labour should be involved in, so I potential massive reform but not one without political consequences. james, thank you. The chief executive of HSBC has told MPs that the recent tax scandal at the bank is unacceptable, regrettable and damaging to HSBC’s reputation. Earlier this month, it emerged that the Swiss arm of the bank helped wealthy clients to avoid pay hundreds of millions of pounds in tax. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed reports. For some, minds have already been made up about HSBC after revelations that it helped customers evade taxes via secret Swiss accounts. Today, the men at the head of the bank made an appearance in the court of public opinion, Westminster. The chief executive told MPs that he was sorry. I’d like to put on the record an apology from both myself and from Douglas for the unacceptable events that took place at our private bank in Switzerland in the mid 2000s, which is clearly an apology we’d like to make to you, to our customers, our shareholders, to the public at large. The boss of Europe’s biggest bank was questioned about his own complicated banking arrangements. He had a personal Swiss account and a company in Panama which he used for payments from HSBC. I myself grew up in Plymouth, I went to a state school, so I can understand how the public would find them unfamiliar and rather strange. Mr Gulliver explained why he did it. There was no tax advantage or purpose whatsoever to the Panamanian COITIPB Fly. As a matter of fact, there was no tax purpose to it. It was a Panamanian nominee entity constructed purely to give me - I’m asking you why you did create it? Purely to give me privacy within my own company. Alongside him was the chairman, who has held a senior position in the bank since the 1990s. He said evading taxes was wrong. It’s completely unacceptable that some people obey the law and others don’t. I mean, I pay all my tax and I find it abhorrent that others don’t. Both men insisted that the Swiss bank had changed and that it would be a red flag now if customers tried to take out millions of pounds in unmarked cash. I’ve just come out of the evidence session by Stuart Gulliver and Douglas Flint here at the Palace of Westminster. Yes, there were certainly apologies, some contrition, but what might frustrate MPs was that there was no individual responsibility taken for the problems that HSBC has faced across its business. Following the bankers it was the turn of Lin Homer, Head of the UK’s Revenue and Customs. She said there would be meetings next week with the Serious Fraud Office and the police to look at whether criminal action was possible. We can share the stolen HSBC Swiss data with our law enforcement agencies and regulators for the pursuits of pursuing wider offences. The bankers left in blacked-out cars after a sobering day of apologies. Caught on camera, it might be a while before we see them public again. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. During the last conflict between Israel and Hamas, more than 2,000 people in Gaza were killed and 18,000 homes were destroyed. 73 Israelis lost their lives. Six months after the ceasefire, tens of thousands of people are still without shelter, electricity and water. International donors pledged $4.5 billion for reconstruction, but little money has arrived. As our Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet has been finding out, most Gazans fear another war is inevitable. War pulled life from the heart of Gaza. It left a wasteland. Smoke still rises. Today, it’s only a digger clearing some of the rubble. Gazans put up signs to describe what stood here, which family lost it, what number to call to deliver help. But almost none has arrived. This family’s home was destroyed in Israeli artillery fire. just before the ceasefire, six months ago, their first son was born. Last month, he froze to death, in what is now another battle just to survive. His grandmother points an accusing finger at all Arab countries saying they haven’t helped Gazans. The boy’s mother said nobody did. TRANSLATION: All countries take care of their children and people. All countries except here. Here the people in charge just sit in their chairs. They care only for their own children. They forget about us. Now, theyjust want to rebuild their home so their two girls will survive. Everyone talks about rebuilding Gaza, but nobody’s doing it. As always here, there’s more than one reason. Israeli restrictions, Palestinian in-fighting, the failure of donors to keep their promises. And why would there be much rebuilding when everyone fears there’ll be another war? 10,000 Gazans still live in UN schools. That number may rise when families’ money runs out. You think conflict’s inevitable. Whether it’s internal conflict or another conflict between Gaza and Israel. Unless the situation on the ground changes, there will be no other action for people to take other than a resumption of violence. And Hamas fighters are ready. They don’t hide it. I’ve seen marches like this on almost every visit in recent months. The main reason for all this catastrophe is occupation. Now Gaza’s turned to be like a bigger prison. There’s no exit, no import, no export. But there are credible reports that Hamas is again digging tunnels. That Hamas has been test-firing missiles in preparation for the next war? This is true, that’s right, but I think that Hamas is doing this in order to protect our people here. We don’t want to be surprised with a new war, a new aggression against us. In the ruins of Gaza, young men train in the sport of overcoming obstacles. Resilient Gazans are good at that. But after three wars, in six years, even the strongest are starting to break. Lyse Doucet, BBC News, Gaza. On tomorrow’s programme we gain exclusive access to the militants in Gaza, who say they’re already preparing for the next war with Israel- one that both sides expect will come sooner, rather than later. The driver of a bin lorry which crashed in Glasgowjust before Christmas, killing six people, will not be prosecuted Scotland’s prosecution service says there is no evidence that the driver, who’s believed to have been unconscious at the time, or the council was to blame. A fatal accident inquiry will now be held. Imposing fines on companies that bombard people with cold calls and text messages is to become easier. Currently, firms can only be punished if it can be proved that a call caused ‘substantial damage or distress’, but from April that legal requirement will be removed. South Yorkshire Police say their investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has increased significantly in size. The force says it’s looking at more than one allegation of historical sexual offences. Sir Cliff was interviewed last year, following claims of abuse involving a young boy. Today, he said he has no idea where the allegations have come from. june Kelly is with me. What more do we know, june? jane, of course Sir Cliff, it emerged last summer, with a was being investigated over one alleged sexual offence, back to 1985, the allegations is that he sexually assaulted a boy under 16 at a rally by the evangelist, Billy Graham. He denied the claim. He said it was completely false. This evening came news that the inquiry into him has been expanded. That confirmation came in a letterfrom the been expanded. That confirmation came in a letter from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to the chair of parliament’s Home Affairs Select Committee, Keith Vaz. In the letter the Chief Constable says, ""this is an investigation which has increased significantly in size. Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers is aware there is more than one allegation."" The singer says, ""Ivano idea where these allegations come from. The police have not disclosed any details to me. He has never in his life assaulted anyone. He remains confident the truth will prevail."" june, thank you. june Kelly. A BBC poll suggests that nearly half of Britain’s Muslims feel the country is becoming less tolerant of them. 1,000 Muslims were surveyed over the last month, to try to guage how they were feeling after the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. Two thirds of those polled said they oppose the use of violence against people who publish images of the Prophet Mohammed. However, just over a quarter said they had some sympathy for the motives behind the attack. Almost everyone questioned, 95%, said they felt loyal to Britain.Our correspondent, Sima Kotecha, reports from Bradford. Bradford. Home to more than 100,000 Muslims. Most are of Pakistani origin. But, it is this country they call home. A group of college students having some time off before lectures. Like many here, they feel a strong loyalty to Britain. I’m a very proud British Muslim. As much as I love Islam, I love Britain itself because the culture and diversity is immense. Especially where we live in Bradford itself. But a new poll has found that almost half of Britain’s Muslims feel this country is becoming less tolerant of them. That Islamophobia is making it a difficult place in which to live. It angers me because I was born here and I’m as much British as any other white person who lives in this country. These Muslim business women are passionate about their faith. They believe the media is fuelling prejudice. I feel like whenever there’s an issue, a crime as an example, the media is very, very quick to highlight that it’s a Muslim that’s actually carried out this crime. I can’t understand the logic behind that. Muslims here say they’re being unfairly scrutinised. That they’re being branded as extremists. They say they shouldn’t have to apologise for a minority of fundamentalists. The poll was conducted in the weeks following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Two thirds of the Muslims surveyed said violence against those who publish pictures of the Prophet can never be justified. Murder was not the answer, never in a million years. Murder is not the answer. I’m completely against it. People shouldn’t be murdering in the name of Islam. However, just over a quarter said they had some sympathy for the motives behind the attacks. They know how much we love our Prophet and how beloved he is to us. That’s not fun. If they didn’t put that photo out... But it wasjust poking fun, was it not? They poked fun at other religions too, it wasn’tjust Islam? It’s not poking fun though. Fun to a limit, but not about a Prophet. There’s a limit with fun. I disagree with anybody dying, 100%. No-one deserves to die, but it wouldn’t have happened if them people didn’t put that photo out, that cartoon out. That’s what I believe. They were provoking a reaction and that’s what they got. This soup kitchen is run by a group of Muslim volunteers. They say it shows how integrated the community is. The vast majority of Muslims are peace-loving, doing their best to help their neighbours, to fit into society, to integrate. But some from the younger generation are struggling to mix. It is a concern for me when young people say, what is the point in engaging in British society when often we’re under attack and feeling marginalised. It creates apathy. Secondly, you don’t know what it can lead to. The poll paints a picture of British Muslims embracing British life. Some argue to live here peacefully, it must be a two-way street. Integration on their part and acceptance by the rest of the UK. Sima Kotecha, BBC News, Bradford. You can find a full breakdown of the poll’s findings on our website, bbc.co.uk/news. They were known as Churchill’s Secret Army - agents from the Special Operations Executive, the SOE, who worked behind enemy lines during the Second World War. Tonight, some of the few surviving veterans are gathering for a dinner to mark the organisation’s 75th anniversary. Our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, has been speaking to some of them. Usually home to dinosaurs, the Natural History Museum seems an unlikely place to host a dinner for veterans of wartime sabotage. Today, this is the mammal gallery, but during the war it was top secret station 15 B. These pictures show how it was used to display gadgets like booby-trapped bricks and exploding turnips for SOE agents. Some of the devices, often hidden in everyday items, can now be seen in the ImperialWar Museum. This catalogue describes just some of the gadgets that SOE used during the war, ranging from concealed radios and weapons, to exploding rats and cowpats that could blow up German armoured vehicles. NEWS REEL: Here with comic apparatus we were able to practice each stage of the parachuting. This dramatisation made just after the war, but featuring real agents, gives a feel for SOE’s work. A 92-year-old American, over for tonight’s dinner, is one of those who parachuted behind enemy lines in France. Well, we were able to accomplish all of our missions. We made it unpleasant for the Germans, so unpleasant that they actually withdrew from our department. Back in Britain, radio operators were vital to keep in touch with agents in the field. Morse, Morse and more Morse. I dreamt in Morse. I even started knitting in Morse. In London’s rather exclusive special forces club, one operator recalls the run-up to D-Day. We just got very, very busy with the messages coming in. They were blowing up bridges and working up from the south of France on the western side up. Once the tourists are gone for tonight’s dinner the gadgets will be on display one more time, although the veterans will have to check in their cloaks and daggers at the door. Gordon Corera, BBC News. The return of Arsene Wenger’s former side Monaco was not a happy one tonight, as Arsenal lost 3-1 at home in their last 16 match of the Champions League. It means they need to score at least three goals in the return leg to go through to the quarter-finals. Our sports correspondent, Natalie Pirks, reports. The flutter of nostalgia. Arsene Wenger led Monaco to the French title 27 years ago, but 16 trophies later, as Arsenal boss, he’s after the one piece of silverware that has so far eluded him. Danny Welbeck did everything right to try to put Arsenal ahead - well, almost everything. Then totally against the run of play, Geoffrey Kondogbia strike took a wicked deflection and stunned goalkeeper Ospina, and the home fans, into silence. This tie was considered the dream draw, but it was turning into a nightmare. Dimitar Berbatov given acres of space. Oh, how the former Spurs and United striker enjoyed pouring salt in the wound. Arsenal simply had to score. In the 90th minute. But just as everything was looking up came the sucker-punch. The Gunners haven’t reached the quarter-finals in five years. What’s the French for deja vu? Natalie Pirks, BBC News. Newsnight is on BBC Two. Here’s Evan Daviswith the details. The old own more homes and have protected pensions. The young not so much.
