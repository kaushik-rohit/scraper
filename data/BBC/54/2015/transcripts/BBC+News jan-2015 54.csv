1,BBC News 24,3-jan-2015,BBC Weekend News,12:00,10 mins,True,"Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd ACCORDION MUSIC PLAYS Good afternoon. A prominent American lawyer has denied claims that he and Prince Andrew had sex with underage girls. Alan Dershowitz, who’s named in court papers, along with Prince Andrew, insisted the woman who made the claims should not be believed. The woman alleged she was forced to have sexual relations with Prince Andrew three times. Buckingham Palace has strenuously denied the allegations. Peter Hunt reports. Prince Andrew was last seen in public with other royals on Christmas Day heading to church. In festive cheer, it will have been replaced with concerns over these allegations. The front pages today will have been a pretty unpalatable read for his family and the Prince. He’s in the headlines again because of his once close friendship with this man, jeffrey Epstein, a registered sex offender. Andrew once stayed with him in New York. The billionaire was sentenced in 2008 to 18 months injail after pleading guilty to an offence of soliciting a minor for prostitution. 14 years ago Prince Andrew was photographed with Virginia Roberts, then 17, described BS as Eckstein’s personal matters. Now Prince Andrew has been named in court papers in Florida. It’s not an action against him. It’s alleged that as a minor woman was a victim of its extrapolating scheme run by Eckstein. The document reads... It’s alleged to have happened once here at zero G on Eckstein’s private island in the Caribbean and also in London and New York. In a statement, Buckingham Palace responded robustly. Another of those accused who has also denied the claim, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, has urged the Prince to fight back. You can’t allow these allegations to hang above you. The first question you have to ask yourself, when you’re charged with a crime like this, is there any conceivable possibility you did it? If the answer is no, you have to fight back with every resource and ounce of energy available to you. Prince Andrew lost hisjob promoting Britain abroad because of his friendship with jeffrey Epstein. He continues to pay a price for it. Search teams from Indonesia have located two large parts of the Air Asia plane that crashed into the java Sea six days ago with 162 people on board. The objects are said to be lying in about 30 metres of water, near an oil slick that was spotted yesterday. confident they have located two large pieces of the wreckage somewhere about 100 miles off the coast. Late last like one of the ships out there searching, using its sonar, detected two objects on the sea floor. They say they are very large objects, lying in about 30 metres of water. They won’t know for certain that these are bits of the plane’s fuse large or its wings until they can get divers down to do with visual identification. Ships have converged on that point, they are trying to put divers in the water, but thatjob is again being hampered by the weather. There are strong winds, big waves and heavy rain at sea at the moment. Hundreds of migrants left stranded when human traffickers abandoned the ship they were on have arrived at a port in southern Italy. All of them had fled Syria. Our correspondent james Reynolds was in the port when the ship docked. It was the eeriest of arrivals. This is how the passengers of the Ezadeen made it to Europe. Their ship entered the harbour in silence, in the dark. Dozens stood on deck to catch their first sight of dry land. We’re told that everyone is reasonably safe in one piece. Doctors were on board a little earlier. It must have been incredibly cold on board because you can see some of the people have blankets. But now, essentially, the journey of these migrants, which would have begun in Syria for some a long time ago, is coming to an end at an Italian port. The Red Cross helped to look after the most vulnerable passengers. They’ve now been taken to shelters. It must take a certain courage for families to risk the journey across the sea with their youngest children. (TRANSLATION) They’re escaping from conflict zones, from persecution, from very severe weather conditions. Winter is very cold, but they didn’t stop for bad weather conditions or for the bad condition of the ship. This morning, Icelandic inspectors from the EU’s Frontex Border Force started to search the ship. In daylight, it’s easy to tell that the Ezadeen wasn’t designed to hold hundreds of passengers. But, with the coastguard’s help, it got them to Europe. Emergency teams in southern Australia are battling out-of-control bushfires. Officials say the blazes in the Adelaide Hills are the worst to have hit the area in more than 30 years. Police have declared a major emergency. From Australia, here’s our correspondent jon Donnison. These are the biggest bushfires of the Australian summer so far. Dozens of homes are feared destroyed in the hills around the city of Adelaide in South Australia. People powerless against the force of the flames. The sound of the roar over the hills, almost like a jet engine on an aeroplane, getting louder and louder. Firefighters are battling on the ground and from the air, but temperatures in the high 30s and winds gusting close to 100 kilometres per hour are hindering their efforts. Local officials are calling these the worst fires the area has seen in more than 30 years. There is not a fire service anywhere in the world that could put this fire out at the moment. There are also blazes in the state of Victoria. Australia faces such fires every year, but environmentalists say global warming is making their recurrence more frequent. Australians could again be facing a long, difficult and dangerous summer. That’s it for now - the next news here on BBC One is at 5.20pm. Good afternoon.

The British nurse diagnosed with ebola is tonight in a critical state in a London hospital. Doctors say Pauline Cafferkey has deteriorated over the past two days. She’d gone to Sierra Leone to help fight the virus. Indonesian authorities believe they’ve found the wreckage of the AirAsia plane, as more bodies are recovered from the sea. The US lawyer named with Prince Andrew over claims of underage sex insists they’re both innocent. Good evening. The British nurse diagnosed with ebola is in a critical state in hospital tonight after a deterioration in her condition. Pauline Cafferkey was one of a number of British public health workers who’d volunteered to go to Sierra Leone to help ebola patients. She was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London after returning from the country last week. Sangita Myska reports. For Pauline Cafferkey, the next few hours are crucial. Within days of returning to the UK from Sierra Leone, the nurse was herself diagnosed with the ebola virus. Today, the doctors treating her at this London hospital said she’d deteriorated to a critical condition. Miss Cafferkey had been one of 50 British health care workers who’d volunteered with the charity Save the Children. She can be seen here on the right before leaving for Sierra Leone. A few days earlier, she’d spoken to BBC Radio Scotland. To me it was a natural thing, I couldn’t think of a reason not to go. I’ve had experience in the past of aid work in Africa. I didn’t really think about it actually, just done it. It’s been less than a week since Pauline Cafferkey returned from Sierra Leone. She flew from Freetown to Casablanca and arrived at London Heathrow on the 28th December. She felt unwell and her temperature was taken seven times as part of the ebola screening programme, but it wasn’t unusually high. She then flew on to Glasgow. The next day she was admitted to hospital there and diagnosed with ebola. The following day, Miss Cafferkey was flown to the specialist unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Since her arrival back in London, doctors have been treating Miss Cafferkey with a combination of an unnamed experimental drug and blood plasma drawn from at least one patient who survived the virus. Stocks of the drug Zmapp successfully used in the treatment of British nurse William Pooley have run out. If I had ebola, I’d rather have the William Pooley type plasma, Zmapp, because both work in the same way, they are antibodies that try to kill off the virus in the body. I wouldn’t be too concerned. It’s a pity there’s none available but there it is. Medical staff say the 39-year-old is being carefully monitored. The hospital is in close contact with her family. Our correspondent Daniela Relph is outside the Royal Free Hospital in North London. A very important few hours now for Mrs Cafferkey? Yes. The next few hours will be absolutely crucial for Pauline Cafferkey, as doctors try to make her comfortable and stabilise her condition. What the deterioration over the past two days has shown is just how variable and unpredictable ebola can be and how the treatment for it is still very experimental. Doctors simply don’t know how patients are going to respond. They will continue to give her those antiviral drugs and the blood plasma from ebola survivors in the hope thatit from ebola survivors in the hope that it will sufficiently boost her immune system to help herfight that it will sufficiently boost her immune system to help her fight the virus more effectively. But these are going to be very difficult hours for Pauline Cafferkey. What is happening to her here at the Royal free is sadly typical of ebola in thatit free is sadly typical of ebola in that it can start quite slowly, quite mildly, the symptoms can be very general, but it’s a very powerful virus that can overtake you very quickly. Search teams in Indonesia looking for the remains of the AirAsia plane that crashed on Sunday have found four large objects on the sea bed. 162 people were on board the flight when it disappeared. But bad weather is hampering the search, as Rupert Wingfield Hayes reports. This is what it looks like on the frontline in the search for the flight. It is a grim harvest. The ships out here may have made a breakthrough. They have detected several large objects sitting on the sea floor. TRANSLATION: I can assure you from the oil spill and the objects we’ve found, I can confirm this is part of the AirAsia aircraft that we have been looking for. These pictures show what the sonar picked up. It’s hard to tell what part of the plane they may be. More help arrived today in the shape of this Russian amphibious aircraft. On board, 70 Russian emergency specialists, including a team of deep-sea divers. Theirjob will be to search for the plane’s black boxes. This team of Russian deep sea divers is preparing to get on board the Indonesian vessel and head out to join the international coalition that’s assembled off shore searching for the plane. They do think they have located at least two very large pieces of the plane’s fuselage lying in 30 metres of water. In order to be sure, they have to send down divers and submersibles into the murky water to make a visual identification. And that is proving very difficult. The reason is the weather. This radar map from this afternoon shows the intense rain systems moving across the search area. At the airbase this afternoon, the latest bodies recovered from the sea were placed in coffins and put aboard a transport plane for the flight back to Surabaya. This is now the sad daily ritual here, and one that looks set to go on for many days to come. A major search operation is under way after a cargo ship carrying cement overturned off the north coast of Scotland. Eight people are believed to be on board the Cypriot-registered vessel. The upturned hull was found by a passing ferry. Coastguards say weather in the area has been poor, and so far no survivors have been found. Two people have been killed in a light aircraft crash in woods in Hampshire. Emergency services were called to a forest near Popham airfield this afternoon. Another person found at the scene is critically ill. A funeral service has been held for three members of the same family killed in the Glasgow bin lorry crash. More than 1,000 people gathered at a church in Dumbarton to remember jack Sweeney, his wife Lorraine and their 18-year-old granddaughter Erin McOuade. They were among six people killed after being struck by an out-of-control bin lorry three days before Christmas. A prominent American lawyer has denied claims that he and Prince Andrew had sex with underage girls. Alan Dershowitz told the BBC he plans to initiate legal action in the American courts on Monday to prove his innocence. Buckingham Palace has strenuously denied the allegations. Peter Hunt reports. Heading to church on Christmas Day, Prince Andrew with other Royals. Any messtive cheer has been replaced by concerns over the allegations which he denies. Also accused and also protesting his innocence, the American lawyer Alan Dershowitz. Tonight, he’s preparing to take legal action against his accuser and he told the BBC the prince should follow suit. My goal is to bring charges against the client and require her to speak in court. She, if she believes she’s been hurt by me and Prince Andrew, she should be suing us for damages. I welcome that lawsuit, I welcome any opportunity which would put her under oath and require her to state under oath these false allegations. This man is the reason Prince Andrew is facing talk of lawsuits. T his once close friend, the American financierjeffrey Epstein, a financier jeffrey Epstein, a registered financierjeffrey Epstein, a registered sex offender. Andrew has stayed with him and they’ve holidayed together. He was sentenced to 18 months injail after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution. 14 years ago, Prince Andrew was photographed with Virginia Roberts, then 17, and who was described as Epstein’s personal that Suhrs. Now the prince has been named in court papers. It’s not an action against him. An unnamed woman alleges that when she was a minor, she was the victim of an alleged scheme run by She maintains it happens at his private island in the Caribbean, also in London and New York. Fishes here at the palace insist these allegations are categorically untrue. But they know that’s not the end of it. Prince Andrew took a big knockin end of it. Prince Andrew took a big knock in 2011 when his links with Epstein were first scrutinised. Four years on, he continues to pay a price for that friendship. Peter joins price for that friendship. Peterjoins me now. There are further developments tonight? Yes. Tonight, the Mail on Sunday have published what they say is the name of the woman who’s made the allegations against Prince Andrew, according to the Mail, his accuser is Virginia Roberts. The BBC has been unable to independently verify this is correct. In response to the Mail’s story, Buckingham Palace have issued a second, robust and quite frankly remarkable statement when you consider that it refers to the fifth in linetoday the British throne, a spokesman told me, it’s emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts, the allegations made are false and without any foundation. A major emergency has been declared in Southern Australia which is experiencing its worst bush fires in over 30 years. Homes and cars have been destroyed and people have been ordered to evacuate the area. High winds are hampering efforts to tackle the flames, although there’ve been no reports of any deaths or injuries. With all the sport, here’s Olly Foster at the BBC Sport Centre. There were 17 third round ties in the FA Cup today, an awful lot of goals coming up on Match Of The Day a little later on BBC One. I’ve got some results for you. If you want them, that is: Three of the five non-league sides left in the draw played today and they all lost. Blyth Spartans were 2-0 up against Birmingham City, 120 places above them through the leagues but lost 3-2. West Brom under new manager Tony Pulis were the biggest winners today, 7-0 against Gateshead. Southport lost to Derby in injury time. Leicester beat Newcastle 1-0 in the all-Premier League tie. Good day for League One sides against Championship opposition. Bradford earned a replay against Millwall. Preston and Rochdale went through against Norwich and Nottingham Forest. Big wins for Bournemouth and Swansea. Steven Gerrard has confirmed he’s going to leave Liverpool for a club in America at the end of the season. He spent his entire career at Liverpool and today he said he’d have won more trophies if Brendan Rodgers joined he said he’d have won more trophies if Brendan Rodgersjoined the club ten years ago. The Ministry of justice says Ched Evans will not be allowed to play abroad. He was released from prison three months ago after serving half of a five-year sentence for rape. There was speculation he’d been offered a court in Malta, but the ministry say as a sex offender on licence, he’s effectively barred from playing overseas. It was the Edinburgh Derby today. Both Hearts and Hibs were in the Championship and Hearts remain unbeaten, 13 points clear at the top after a 1-1 draw. Hearts pounding Edinburgh divided. Always the game fans want to win, and with the City’s teams lying first and third, the encounter lent extra passion. The fevered atmosphere did lit toll put the visitors off their stride. Cummings poking Hibs ahead. Hisjoy tempered only by his inability to add a second just moments later. It proved a big opportunity missed. Particularly down the other end as Walker was taking aim with devastating effect. A second half of tough tackling and even tougher defending neither side able to find a way through. Yet no amount of hoping or praying could bring glory to either side of the city. Andy Murray’s won his first title of 2015 without hitting a ball. He’s beenin 2015 without hitting a ball. He’s been in Abu Dhabi for a few days playing in an exhibition event and Novak Djokovic withdrew from the final because he was feeling unwell. At the World Championship darts, Scotland’s Gary Anderson is through to the final after knocking out Michael van Gerwen tonight. That’s all the sport. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from me Goodnight. Good evening. Bit of a drab day today for many across England and Wales. A lot of cloud around and, with that cloud, it brought some rain, that you can see moving from west-to-east. An inch of rain in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire as the afternoon continued. It cleared slowly but surely, the best of the brightness further north with a few sharp showers. Some icy stretches possible tonight. Under the clearer skies, the temperatures falling quite sharply. Murky conditions further south with low cloud and shallow mist and fog. The talking point first thing on Sunday morning will certainly be the feel of the hard frost in country sides. Temperatures will fall down to minus four or five. Some of that low cloud, that shallow mist and fog will linger for a time. A disappointing day across much of England and Wales. The best of any brightness really to the east of the Pennines and in sheltered eastern areas of Scotland. But here it will continue to feel rather raw. If the cloud sits there for much of the day, cold across northern England as well, two or three degrees. Milder further south and west. Perhaps staying into double figures but a bit of drizzle is possible. That will be the story as we move Monday into Tuesday. Staying cloudy with bits and pieces of rain around. But, through the week, conditions will change. Cloudy and damp and relatively mild, but This programme contains some strong language.

At least 12 people have been shot dead in Paris - two of them police officers - after masked men stormed the offices of a French magazine. 10 others have been wounded, several critically, at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical weekly which has printed cartoons deriding the Prophet Mohammed. Gunmen burst into the magazine’s offices in the centre of Parisjust over two hours ago and then fled the scene. The French President, Francois Hollande, described the attack as an act of exceptional barbarism. jon Brain reports. You may some of the images disturbing. A&E. Terror in the heart of Paris. -- GUNFIRE. Masked and heavily armed, masked men enterthe building in the capital Centre this morning and begin firing. By the time they had stopped at least 12 people were dead. Many others were seriously injured. The police were quickly on the scene only to come under attack themselves. Images posted on social media capture the drama. Eyewitnesses have been describing what they saw. A neighbour called to warn me that there were armed men in the building and we had to shut all of the doors. Several minutes later there were several shots heard in the building from automatic weapons, firing in all directions. It was really upsetting. You would think it was a war zone. Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine, has been attacked before. just over three years ago its premises were firebombed after it published a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed. Shortly after this morning’s attack, the French president came to issue a message of defiance on behalf of his nation. This is an act of exceptional barbarism that has just happened here in Paris. Against a newspaper, and a newspaper means free speech, and this was against journalists who have always endeavoured to show that, in France, it can operate to defend their ideas. The gunman escaped in a stolen car. They are now being pursued by the police across Paris -- gunman. Let’s get the latest now from our correpsondent Lucy Williamson, who’s at the scene. As you mentioned, the introduction -- in the introduction, there are 12 people confirmed dead and several injured, and four of them seriously wounded, so those numbers could rise. just standing outside the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine I can tell you there is a real sense of shock and confusion that this happened right in the capital. There are lines of ambulances and police trucks all around the area, and really everyone is asking the question what motivated the attack. And who carried it out. The Prime Minister has announced there will be police protection around other media offices in the coming hours. Transport centres, religious centres, but at the heart of this event is the question of who planned the attack, who executed it, and why. Lucy, thank you. With me now is or security correspondent, Frank Gardner. A lot of footage emerging online of the attacks, and you can tell from the just how ruthless the attackers were. This attack was in a totally different ballpark from the previous ones that France has experienced in the last few months where you had lone individuals, often with psychological problems, driving a vehicle into a crowd of people, injuring them must sometimes shouting phrases, Islamic phrases. But this was different. This was carefully planned, there was a reconnaissance, surveillance and it was well executed. I’ve seen a video filmed by somebody on a rooftop which shows the two gunmen, and as far as we know there’s only two of them, dressed in typicaljihad eve battle dress, head to toe in black with black balaclavas, khaki globes, Kalashnikov rifles, and then they wounded a policeman fatally, shooting him in the head, so it’s both an intelligence and security -- security failure and it’s worrying they can get hold of these weapons and then escape. I think you said earlier that they were being pursued across Paris, but I’d like to know if somebody knows where they are. They could have gone to ground. They will have probably planned for this, to the next phase. And there is a precedent way you had in Madrid and elsewhere attacks that have started off like this and ended in a huge explosion. They will probably want to either go down in a blaze of gunfire or some sort of explosion. Ten journalists gunfire or some sort of explosion. Tenjournalists are dead gunfire or some sort of explosion. Ten journalists are dead and two police officer-- officers. Charlie Hebdo have been threatened and attacked before. They have a is why it surprisingly didn’t have better security. They have been firebombed in the past and said they wanted to defend their right to free speech. Plenty of people in France you have nothing to do with Islam have said, hang on, you are going a bit far here. Both in terms of personal safety and in terms of being provocative. But France has a tradition, as many Western countries do, of not wanting to infringe on the freedom of the press, which is why they took this risk and it has cost them their lives. There was the Danish cartoon incidents a few years ago which inflamed tensions across the wider Middle East. This will have ripples that go way beyond Paris. This will get people to reconsider security preparations here in the UK and a number of Western countries, in the same way as after the Mumbai attacks in 2008. There will be a lot of discussion in the National Security Council in Whitehall, I am sure, after this. This is a developing story, and we will certainly be coming back to it later in the programme. Thank you, Frank. More than a dozen hospitals in England have now declared ""major incidents"" in response to unprecedented demand on their accident and emergency departments. Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge is the latest to say it can’t cope with demand. A political row has erupted about who’s to blame. Labour has called for an emergency meeting but ministers have accused the party of trying to generate headlines. Our political correspondent Vicki Young reports. In hospitals across England they are struggling to cope with the sheer number of patients coming through the doors. But are these scenes of chaos in the corridors of emergency departments a symptom of a wider crisis in the NHS, or temporary winter pressure that will pass? Labour’s Andy Burnham has written to the Health Secretary demanding an emergency summit, saying that patients are being exposed to unacceptable levels of risk and the situation cannot be allowed to get any worse. Urgent action is needed, he says, to provide a coordinated response across government from all public services. So no surprise that the NHS was centre stage at Prime Minister’s Questions. Does he agree with me that our NHS is facing a crisis? our NHS is facing huge pressure this winter, particularly in the A&E units, but I think it is important to make this point, that the NHS is facing this winter with more doctors, more nurses and more ITIOFE dOCtoI’S, ITIOFE I’IUI’SâS and ITIOFE ITIOI’Iây more doctors, more nurses and more money than it has ever had in its history. Mr Miliband said the government was to blame for the problems are the closing walk-in centres and cutting social care funding. -- centres and cutting social care funding.-- after centres and cutting social care funding. -- after closing. funding.-- after closing. Mr Speaker, he is in denial about the crisis in the NHS, and this is a crisis on his watch as a result of his decisions. That’s why people know if they want to get rid of the crisis in the NHS, they have to get rid of this Prime Minister. If ever you wanted proof that they want to use this issue as a political football, you’ve just seen it. Labour deny that their call for a summit is a political stunt, but there is no doubt that these problems are a gift to the opposition, just a few months before an election that they would love to be all about who can be trusted to run the NHS. Coalition ministers insist they have protected spending on health service but politicians on all sides know that this is about more than money. It’s about the way that GPs work, about the way that social services can be integrated into the system, and that is a much wider debate. Well, let’s speak to our assistant political editor, Norman Smith. No doubt about it, this will be a big political issue in the run-up to the election. Let me say I was surprised at Prime Minister’s Questions that it was not a more sombre and restrain fare in the wake of the French terror attack, but it tells its own story as it was one of the most acrimonious and partisan exchanges almost entirely dominated by winter pressures on the NHS which demonstrates how emotive issue the NHS is, and also the extent to which the winter difficulties have been highly politicised with both sides in effect blaming each other. Ed Miliband saying it was the government cuts to social care and walk-in centres that fuelled the crisis. David Cameron implied it was Ed Miliband’s language that stoked UP Ed Miliband’s language that stoked up the talk of a crisis, and of treating the issue as a political football and trying to politically weaponised the issue of the NHS, but Mr Cameron has difficulty and it is this. He was asked if there was a crisis and he could not answer it. If he acknowledged there was a crisis, that would be an admission of failure. But by not acknowledging that, he risks the danger of charges of complacency, denial, of crisis, what crisis? Headlines. All this talk of a summit and all-party talks on the future of the NHS to resolve a crisis, based on today’s prime ministers questions, no chance of that before the election. And with me is our Health Editor Hugh Pym. When you look at the huge pressures on A&E, the obvious thing is there are so many different factors feeding into it. Indeed so. just look at the pressures. We have been told there were the highest number of ambulance calls and A&E attendances and the highest number of emergency admissions in the history of the NHS over the last few weeks. To give you some indication of the scale of patient demand that the NHS has had to cope with, and there are a number of factors, and there has been a debate about the 111 helpline. Have call operators taken too simplistic a root and send more people to A&E or called out more Ambulance Services than was needed? The debate goes on. There is theissue needed? The debate goes on. There is the issue of social care funding and the decline of facilities in the community to take elderly patients coming out of hospital so they stay in hospital, and that affects the ability to take on admissions.

And it was said that there needed to be a fundamental redesign of the front door of the NHS, 999,111 fundamental redesign of the front door of the NHS, 999, 111 and so on, and that will not happen in a few months before a general election. Prices in the Eurozone fell by 0.2% in the year to December. While deflation is welcome news for consumers, it’s adding to mounting concerns about the state of the eurozone economy. Here’s our personal finance correspondent, Simon Gompertz. Good news for drivers is perversely putting a big question over attempts to breathe new life into the economy of the Eurozone nations. If you are plunging petrol and diesel, and Eurozone prices at six point 9% -- nor .6%, which is inflation, but if you ignore the fuel, that is an overall drop of 0.2%, which is deflation. Something to celebrate if you are buying now, but a major concern looking ahead. The worry is that people will postpone purchases, that they will wait a few months before they buy a big good in order to see prices fall further, and you get into a downward spiral of Verdu chief Laois of that starts to happen. -- of Verdu chief Laois of that starts to happen. -- of further deflation. The ECB encourages investment by businesses, but the path has been relentlessly downward in the Eurozone. That is putting pressure on Marianne druggie, the head of the ECB, to try to kick-start the growth by creating funds for banks to lend. Mac -- by creating funds for banks to lend. Mac -- Mario Draghi. That follows quantitative easing in the UK and United States, a modern way of printing Manning. Even quantitive easing is not a silver bullet, so thatis easing is not a silver bullet, so that is a drastic situation when you have low growth and deflation -- printing money. The price of oil has more than halved. Brent Crude dipped below $50 per barrel earlier today. That fuelled fears that deflation could become entrenched. Add to that renewed disaffection in Greece with an election this month, and the cloud of uncertainty over the Eurozone appears to have thickened. David Cameron will meet the German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Downing Street this afternoon. The economy and reforms to the European Union are expected to be the focus of talks as well as global issues like Ebola and counter-terrorism. Sainsbury’s has announced its worst Christmas sales for a decade, with its new boss saying the rest of the year will ""remain challenging"". Sales for the last quarter fell by 1.7%, however Sainsbury’s said the week before Christmas was a record for customer transactions. Our Business Correspondent Emma Simpson reports. Sainsbury’s dancing dads. These Christmas woollyjumpers were flying off the shelves. It’s the time of year when supermarket sales should grow, but for the first time in a decade Sainsbury’s Christmas sales fell. It’s a reflection of the fact there is quite a significant amount of price deflation in the market. Prices have fallen in food for the first time in probably a generation. Not so good for the top line. Broadly speaking we have sold the same amount of stuff but at a lower price year-on-year. Sainsbury’s figures were actually better than expected. Helped by these convenience stores, which saw growth of 16%. In a sign of how tough things are, this grocer is likely to have been one of the stronger performers this Christmas. On the face of it, some disappointing numbers for Sainsbury’s but it is worth putting that in context. We are in a zero growth market and all four of the big supermarkets for the first time in living memory will produce a negative like-for-like performance over Christmas. These are unprecedented times for the supermarket sector and they are having to run faster just to stand still. Here is another reason. The rise of discounters like Aldi. A change in how we shop, including Christmas. We got the turkey off the local market, a fresh turkey crown. We got the veg from Tesco the day before Christmas Eve. Everything was 1+9p. Some things I get from Waitrose, some things I get from Sainsbury’s or Lidl. Sainsbury’s is fighting back with price cuts today. The question is, will it be enough? All eyes are on what its bigger rival Tesco will reveal tomorrow and whether it ramps up the battle at the tills. Our top story this lunch time: 12 people, including two policemen, have been shot dead after masked men stormed the offices of a French magazine.

More than 8,000 people have now died of Ebola, almost all of them in West Africa, and more than 20,000 people have been infected. Crucial to ending the outbreak is the way the bodies are buried. Anybody who dies at home is presumed to be an Ebola victim, and their body is collected by special burial teams. Our global health correspondent spent the day with a team from the Sierra Leone Red Cross. It is around quarter past ten. We have arrived in an area called Wellington. As you can see the Red Cross team are explaining to the community here what they are doing. Over here we have the burial teams getting ready to go into the house and collect the body. It is 11:05am and the burial teams have picked up their first body of the day. The decontamination process is a long one. They take their time in making sure they have cleaned themselves properly, that they take off their kit in a very specific way, because this is a very dangerous moment for them. We have come to an area called Grassfields. The body collection team are collecting their second body of the day. It hasjust gone 11:30am. This tiny body of this three-week-old little boy hasjust been brought out of the house wrapped in plastic. One of the burial team has held him in his arms. He is lowered into the ground. just in front of all the community, the imam has come out and he is saying a prayer. We make our way to the third pick-up of the morning, just a couple of miles away. The body is being brought out of this man’s home. He died in the early hours of the morning. CRYING Clearly the family here are utterly devastated. He went to seek treatment, we understand, at a holding centre, but he left at some point yesterday. We don’t know why. He came back here and he died in the early hours of this morning. This is the fourth body that the burial team here have come to collect in as many hours. It is the body of a 37-year-old who complained of feeling unwell over the weekend and by yesterday, last night in fact, he was dead. This is a known hotspot. Burial teams have been here almost every day, they say, over the last couple of weeks, but this is work they will continue to do because there is no sign of this ending at any point soon. We are at the city’s main cemetery and it hasjust gone lipm and the burial team have buried all four of the bodies they collected earlier. They say they will continue this harrowing job for as long as it takes and know they will probably be here almost every day for months to come. Schools across the UK are struggling to cope with the numbers of students self harming, according to two of the UK’s biggest teaching unions. The warning comes as NHS figures seen by the BBC show a 20% rise in the number of hospital admissions of 10 to 19-year-olds because of self harm injuries. BBC Newsbeat reporter Dan Whitworth reports. For 18-year-old Holly, studying at Plymouth University and getting engaged to her partner means life is good. A few years ago, however, it was a different story. Bullying at school and problems at home led her to self-harm. I did end up in hospital for an overdose. I had cuts down both my arms. I had to go back to the doctors twice to get them re-bandaged and looked at. That was definitely my lowest moment. My mum and dad had to watch over me, every second. Teachers are often on the front line trying to help self harmers, but say cuts to support services have left schools struggling to identify and help people who do it. Schools are struggling because there is an increase in the number of people coming forward and disclosing that they are self harming, and also sources of support... Not too long ago there were sources available. That is not the case nowadays due to cutbacks. Schools are being asked to do more and more in the medicalfield due to recent changes and this is taking the eye off the ball of the main business of school, which is teaching. NHS figures for England Wales and Northern Ireland, there were none available for Scotland, show there were just under 23,000 admissions to hospital for under 20s due to self harm injuries in 2012-2013. Last year it was up to almost 29,000, an increase of about a fifth. Teaching unions say, at schools across the UK, more students are deliberately hurting themselves, and medical experts agree, saying that self- harm is on the rise, particularly among teenagers for both girls and boys. People self harm because they are in psychological distress that is so severe that they prefer physical harm or physical pain to their psychological state. They’re under pressure from schools, from their peers, from the economic situation, from the media. They’re often isolated and if that is extended to their own families, it can be very serious and damaging. The Government says £150 million is being invested over the next five years to address mental health issues like self-harm, so that more people like Holly can get the help they need to start getting better. Sales of new cars in the UK have hit a 10 year high. Almost 2.5 million were registered last year. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says sales were boosted by confidence in the economic recovery. Buying a car is a big commitment, the biggest single purchase we make after buying a house. In 2014 sales of new cars sword. What drove customers into showrooms? It was about strong product. Added to that was the economy was improving and consumer disposable incomes were going up and Britain has become a honeypot in Europe because with the European market being soft and the pound being relatively strong, all manufacturers are looking to sell their production in Britain. Last year there were almost 2.5 million new cars sold, a ten year high. The market was up more than 9% on the previous year. A much stronger performance than a 5.7% rise across the EU. The way we buy cars is also fuelling sales. Most customers use personal contract purchase schemes. Effectively leasing the vehicle. This car, the Ford Fiesta, was once again Britain’s most popular vehicle. 130,000 were sold last year. Ford says around 90% of cars sold that its dealerships were sold using these products. You can drive this away for £160 a month. This type of financing model depends on the value of the asset at the end of the three years. If we see an avalanche of second-hand used cars it could depress values, reduce the value of the asset and increase the cost. Whether this is sustainable going forward is a big question. As for 2015 the industry is cautiously optimistic, but few expect sales to accelerate as strongly again. Back now to our main story, the shooting dead of 12 people after masked men stormed the offices of a French magazine in Paris. Gunmen burst into the officesjust over two hours ago. Our correspondent is there. We are seeing reports that a number of those who have been killed our cartoonists. That is right. Several reports saying some of those who were killed were the cartoonists, one of them allegedly a senior cartoonist. That has not been confirmed. Ten people were journalists working there and two were police officers and there are seven others who were injured, four of them seriously, who are being monitored in hospital. The police have found the card that the attackers used to flee the scene. There is still no sign of the attackers. We can see from footage that these attackers were absolutely ruthless and are still on the run. They are still on the run. Wearing black masks and carrying automatic weapons, firing apparently indiscriminately as they stormed into the magazine headquarters. The Prime Minister has said there was extra police protection being put around media hubs and religious centres and school children have been told to stay in school.

Not just the strong winds could cause problems, some very stormy seas as well. Dust is potentially of 100 mph. -- gusts. Perhaps 80-90 mph. Potential for disruption. Certainly within this amber area, but potentially in the yellow area. Those winds will clear quickly on Friday and we are left with a standard windy day. Very mild conditions further south. Plenty more details on the website. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunch time. 12 people have been shot dead after masked men stormed the offices of a French magazine. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC London News. I’m Sonja jessup. It’s ""unacceptable"" and ""embarrassing"". Rail bosses have told BBC London they’re ashamed by the two days of delays and overcrowding at one of the capital’s busiest stations. Thousands of commuters at London Bridge have had their rush hourjourneys home disrupted as they’ve been unable to get through entrance gates, and onto already delayed trains. Network Rail says the new station can’t cope with the number of services it’s running. Our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards has this report. Commuters using London Bridge have not held back condemning the disruption, and last night was no different. Again, there were long queues, delays, alterations and cancellations, with some saying the overcrowding was dangerous. I am very angry. Fares have been increased again this year, and I have been working here for eight years, and it doesn’t seem to improve at all. It makes you just think about leaving London. If you’re going to plan disruption, you don’t have the trains advertised in the first place, then you don’t say they are cancelled. It could have been planned slightly better. There has been extensive rebuilding a London Bridge over Christmas. New platforms and signalling were meant to be introduced smoothly, and the upgrade had been planned for years. They are clearly not managing the concourse very well but I genuinely don’t understand when you have taken trains out of the timetable and you have closed the two weeks over Christmas and on all the work why it ",,

'The Voice is back:' Tonight at six, a terrorist attack in the heart of Paris leaves 12 dead and others seriously injured.

Rail bosses apologise for chaos at London Bridge. But say the answer is to cut the number of trains. And terror police arrest a lIo-year-old in Crawley. Good evening from Paris, where police and security forces are mounting an unprecedented security operation following a terrorist attack in the heart of the French capital. At least 12 were killed, including two police officers, when gunmen broke into the offices of Charlie Hebdo, which is a well known satirical magazine here in France. The officers, by the way, just to get our bearings, about 100 metres down. In the past it’s been attacked for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The magazine itself has been under police protection in recent years. President Hollande was on the scene within an hour of this atrocity, saying it was an outrageous and barbaric attack on freedom of speech. Otherworldly does have echoed those sentiments. First this evening, our correspondent Lucy Williamson as this report, and there are some distressing images in the peace. -- otherworld are some distressing images in the peace. -- other world leaders. In the quiet of a Paris street, they came to kill. Their war cry, God is great, ringing in the heart of the French capital. Their targets: journalists at a weekly magazine. They killed the policemen who were guarding it too. A cold-blooded execution. Eyewitnesses say the men who did this spoke fluent French, forcing one employee to punch in the door’s security code before pushing their way in. It took five minutes to kill the magazine’s top cartoonists, including a legendary artist and the editor, Stephane Charbonnier. The casualties were to avenge their prophet, the gunmen said. I can still hear the shots ringing through yes, I never believed I would hear shooting on my own street. Everyone was running away, Ifeel shooting on my own street. Everyone was running away, I feel really scared, very frightening. This didn’tjust happen, it feels like a religious war. Charlie Hebdo has been attacked before. The magazine has routinely pointed its pen at politicians, Christians and the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. TRANSLATION: We are threatened because we are a country of freedom, and because we are a country of freedom, we will be able to face these threats. We will punish the attackers. Nobody must think they can act against the principles of the French Republic. This attack exposes growing tensions within French society between the values of a secular state and some of its Muslim residents. Too many, it is a sign of a new era in relations here, and a sign of how vulnerable Western capitals can be. Tonight a massive manhunt is under way to find those who carried out this attack. Their car was found abandoned and empty. Across the capital, extra police are being drafted in to protect the buildings as a new awareness here tonight of how vulnerable the city is and a new and bloody landmark on the map of France. Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Paris. Let’s talk a little bit more about this magazine, Charlie Hebdo. The editor had been under police protection. It has been a hugely controversial publication, the target of lots of criticism and some violent attacks in the past by Islamist extremists. So in view of that protection, questions are being asked of this evening about how this attack might have happened, and our security correspondent Frank Gardner looks at the circumstances and the response now of the French authorities. A brazen attack in broad daylight in a European capital. France had been on alert for something like this, but nothing quite on this scale. The French state has been very confrontational in its approach towards Islamists and the violent Islamist in particular, they have taken a hard line on wearing the veil, so the country is seen as being at the forefront of the West against Islam. This means that... Over the last month... Today’s terrorist attack in France did not come out of the blue. Over the last month there have been a number of less serious attacks by lone individuals in Nantes, in Tours, and in Dijon. In june last year, police in Marseille arrested a jihadist with a machine gun, the same man who worked earlier killed four people in Brussels. Over the Christmas period, France deployed troops in public places, but that was clearly no deterrent to whoever carried out today’s attack. This morning it’s treated a cartoon of an Islamic State leader. The gun attack came one hour later, probably too soon for the two to be connected. By tonight, thousands had tweeted their solidarity with the magazine. Many Muslims had been quick to condemn the attack. There is a huge challenge now to expose this ideology, the sources of funding, where it comes from, and above all to say to young people that if you want to challenge what goes on in Syria, if you want to highlight the issue of Palestine and the Israelis, then the way to do thatis the Israelis, then the way to do that is through the political process. Today’s attack in Paris as disturbing echoes of the one in Mumbai in 2008. Once again, a small numberof Mumbai in 2008. Once again, a small number of heavily armed gunmen has wreaked havoc at the heart of the city. Once again, governments around the world will be asking themselves, how do we stop this happening here? Frank Gardner, BBC News. There has been reaction throughout the day and strong condemnation from world leaders. Angela Merkel added her voice, world leaders. Angela Merkel added hervoice, calling it an world leaders. Angela Merkel added her voice, calling it an outrageous and barbaric attack on freedom of speech. She is in London today, beating David Cameron, who underlined those sentiments. President Obama offered any help from the United States to bring the perpetrators to justice. james Landale, our deputy political editor, has been looking at the response so far. For world leaders, the threat of terrorism is a daily reality, and these two are no exception. Today the German chancellor was in London for talks with David Cameron. A planned visit to a museum went ahead as expected, but their discussions were immediately overshadowed by the Paris attacks. We must never allow the values that we hold dear of democracy, freedom of speech, to be damaged by these terrorists. We must stand against what they have done, and Ifeel huge stand against what they have done, and I feel huge sympathy for everyone in France, particularly the families of those who have lost loved ones. In Germany, Angela Merkel has been facing days of anti-Islamic demonstrations that are expected to grow in response to the Paris attacks, along with more counterdemonstrations by supporters of immigration. TRANSLATION: What happened today in Paris is a barbaric attack against the values which we all share in Europe. We strongly condemn this attack. Our thoughts are with the people of France, especially all those who have lost loved ones. In the last hour here at Downing Street, the Prime Minister and hour here at Downing Street, the Prime Ministerand Mrs Prime Minister and Mrs held a joint telephone call with President Hollande. -- telephone call with President Hollande. -- Mrs. They offered him any help they needed. Later denied the Prime Minister will get a full intelligence briefing from the security agencies. In the United States, a country that is no stranger to terrorism, such as the attack on the Boston Marathon two years ago, the president said that all America stood together with the people of France. For us to see the kind of cowardly, evil attacks that took place today, I think reinforces once again why it is so important for us to stand in solidarity with them, as they do with us. Year in Britain, no change to the threat level, currently set at severe, which means an attack is highly likely, but the Foreign Office updated its travel advice, warning visitors to Paris to take extra care. And others who, like the staff of Charlie Hebdo, make their living through satire, said there should be no concession to what they called anti-human terrorism. I think the best response, even in this moment of horror, is to laugh them back into the dustbin of history. And around the world tonight, millions of people are showing their celebrity with the staff of Charlie Hebdo on social media. The global response to a global threat. james Landale, BBC News, Westminster. So the response from world leaders is clear, but making our way to this spot through the crowded centre of Paris, many Parisians are on the street, and the plaster the Labour league -- street, and the plaster the Labour league -- Place de la Republique, wanting to come out and say what they feel about what has happened today. Christian Fraser, a sense of what is developing. France has a lot of experience of this, they have been involved in many manhunts of this nature, so they will be looking first and foremost at the getaway car, which was found very quickly in the 19 aren’t Eastman, to the north of the city. Forensic police have been poring over that. -- of the city. Forensic police have been poring over that. -- 19th arrondissement. As you say, the French are mobilising, they are very good at that, and tonight they are coming out in defence of freedom of speech, and in defence of the Republic. We have placed down the road, but also in Tours. We have heard from a former Prime Minister who is among the people demonstrating tonight in the Place de la Republique, and she has been talking about security, which has been stepped up to the highest level in France. She echoed the question is, as to why this office, not very far from us, is, as to why this office, not very farfrom us, hadn’t been better protected. It was a soft target, a prominent target, and when you think of what France is involved in geopolitical eat, they have been involved in Mali, the Central African Republic, they have an aircraft carrier in the Gulf which is focused on the Islamic State, there are plenty of buildings in this city which will be the focus for those types of militants who might be returning here to France, and I have to look at this, they will have to step up security, as they are already doing. There were police on the train today from King’s Cross to Paris, you don’t normally see them on the train, but they are stepping up at tourist attractions across the city and obviously government buildings and media offices. This is not the only attack there has been on a media building in France, we were reporting a year ago on the attack in the reception of Liberation. Our French colleagues here, for them it is a very grim day, because a lot of them will have met Stephane Charbonnier, the editor of Carly Epico, they will have been to as press conferences, they know how brave he has been. -- press conferences, they know how brave he has been. -- the editor of Charlie Hebdo. Christian Fraser there, my colleague, not far from the offices of Charlie Hebdo. As I say, 100 metres down there on the right-hand side. We are expecting President Hollande to add to the response he gave early and to address the French nation on television some time this evening. But for now, from Paris, back to London. Today’s other stories, and more than a dozen hospitals in England have now declared major incidents in response to unprecedented demand on accident and emergency departments. A political row has erupted about who is to blame. The Labour leader has accused the government of betraying patience, but David Cameron accused them of using the NHS as a political football. Most key parts of the NHS are running at full stretch. In some areas, staff say they have never known pressure quite like it. We have been under extreme pressure for the last few weeks, we have got extra resources on to cope with the pressures, the delays we are getting at the hospitals. It has caused quite a few problems for ourselves. One of the main pressure points is the increasing number of people arriving at hospital A&E units, and there is a debate about precisely why that should be happening. Could the NHS 111 helpline, for example, be encouraging more patients to go to hospital? Critics say call operators tell them to go to a doctor or to the hospital. They are likely to be transferred on other services and will turn up in A&E departments or GP surgeries for a second opinion to find out what is causing their problem. NHS chiefs have denied 111 have added to pressure is on the system this winter. We are confident it is not behind the pressure seen on A&E. It is one of the clear elements to solve the issue in the long term, it takes away the demand. It is notjust about people going into hospital but when they come out. In some cases finding places where treatment can be continued. Social care is under strain to discharge patients can be delayed. While some hospitals were closely with local authorities to move the elderly back into the community, others struggle. Social services blamed a lack of funding from government. We have had a 26% reduction in our budget, out of social care in this country as needs are rising. It is a major reason -- reason why it is pressurised. There were fierce exchanges in the Commons. It is disgraceful, the NHS isn’t a weapon, it is a way we care forfamilies, the way isn’t a weapon, it is a way we care for families, the way we care that the elderly and the way we care for the rail. Perhaps when he gets to his feet he will deny he said he wanted to weaponised the NHS, disgusting thing to say. What is disgusting is a Prime Minister who said people could put their trust Later on BBC London.

Close to 2.5 million were registered last year. Sales rose each month with December’s rise representing a record 34th consecutive monthly jump. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says sales were boosted by confidence in the economic recovery. Our business correspondent john Moylan reports. On the lookout for a bargain. At this dealership today, cheap finance and free fuel was offered to keep car sales motoring on. They normally have good offers injanuary. It is good to buy a new car at this time. It is always good to have a deal going because it draws people in. They are making cars affordable for people. In 2014 we snapped up almost 2.5 million cars. The market was up more than 9% on the previous year, and much stronger performance than the 5.7 per side -- and much stronger performance than the 5.7 per side -- percent rise across the EU. And Ford was the most popular brand. What does its chairman think drove customers into showrooms. From afford point of view it was about strong product. Added to that, the economy was improving and disposable incomes were going up. Britain has become a regional honeypot in Europe because of the European market being soft and the pound being strong, manufacturers are looking to sell their product in Britain. Attractive finance deals are fuelling sales. There has been a surge in PCPs where customers lease vehicles. The Ford Fiesta was Britain’s most popular vehicle. 130,000 of sold last year. Ford said most of the cars sold in their dealerships were used using this PCPs products. You can drive this one away for £160 a month. But few believe sales will accelerate as strongly in the year ahead. Two of the UK’s largest teaching unions say schools are struggling to deal with the rising numbers of students who are self-harming. It’s as new NHS figures obtained by the BBC show there’s been a 20% increase in the number of hospital admissions of 10 to 19 year-olds deliberately hurting themselves across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These latest figures show almost 29,000 young people were treated for self-inflicted injuries injust one year. BBC Radio1 Newsbeat’s Dan Whitworth has this report. It’s a hidden crisis taking place behind closed doors - a nightmare happening in many family homesjust like this one. Emma, who’s 13, started deliberately cutting herself aged 12. I had to do it every night because of school and what a rubbish day I’d had at school. We’ve changed her and her mother’s names to protect their identities. Ifelt like I was rubbish and I deserved to be hurt. I was in my room and didn’t really know what to do. I was crying and my head was so messed up. I kept thinking of stuff that hurt me and transferred it onto myself. I actually got a telephone call out of the blue from the school to say that another child had actually been with them and told them they had concerns that Emma was self harming. I had no inkling that she was doing it. But obviously at the age that Emma is she wants her privacy, she goes and has a bath and things and I don’t go into the bathroom because she wants that previously at her age. I felt completely out of my depth really as a mother, that I’d failed her, I suppose, to a point. It’s notjust at home where people are affected by this. Teachers are often on the front line and say schools across the UK are struggling to identify and deal with the problem. Schools are being asked to do and more and more in the medical field due to recent changes and this is taking the eye off the ball of the main business of the school. Which is teaching and learning. The Government says it’s investing £150 million to help tackle mental health problems among young people, including self harm. It’s thought as many is one in 12 could be deliberately hurting themselves. The reasons why our complex. The reasons why are complex.

Plans to salvage the ship which was carrying luxury cars had been abandoned but now the ship is afloat and is being towed to a safe position where any damage can be assessed. This was the dramatic moment the Hoegh Osaka finally freed herself. Twisting round mid-Solent and now clear of the sandbank that had been her home since Saturday. Salvage operators had earlier given up on trying to move her today, but then just after lunch time the 51,000-tonne vessel refloated on the midday high tide. And so after four days trapped on a sandbank the Hoegh Osaka is tonight finally on the move, being towed across the Solent by these huge tugs towards Gosport, where the waters are deeper and calmer, enabling the salvage crews to begin their work. The ship still has 1400 cars and 100 jCBs on-board. They’ll be taken off when it properly safe and stable. But for those who know this busy shipping lanes well there isjust relief the vessel is now clear. It’s amazing to watch how they have all worked together. We haven’t seen anything like this on the Solent for the 25 years I’ve been on here. I think it’s a credit to them the way it’s been carried out. Our speeded-up pictures showed just how much progress the Hoegh Osaka has made tonight. She wasn’t supposed to move until tomorrow at the earliest, but with a little help from the forces of wind, tide and luck this major operation is now coming to an end. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News, on the Solent. Now the weather. Blowy in the Solent today but we have stormy weather, especially across the northern half of the UK on Friday and perhaps at the weekend. We are expect in problems. It is about heavy rain across southern Scotland. It will be windy across the South with outbreaks of rain here. Cold enough for the showers across western Scotland to be snow over the hills. Water content I see as temperatures drop below single figures. Some heavy showers across southern England and South Wales in the morning, but they do tend to go away. Showers across Scotland, again with snow over the hills. But tomorrow is a bright and breezyjanuary day with plenty of afternoon sunshine with temperatures about average. All eyes to the far north-west. On Thursday night, this is the first of those areas of strong winds. Vicious area of low pressure intensifying. Gusts across Scotland and part of Northern Ireland, 60 to 70 miles an hour. The far north-west of Scotland, the Western Isles and Orkney, gusts of 70 and 80 and possibly 100 miles an hour. There is an amber warning 70 and 80 and possibly 100 miles an hour. There is an amberwarning in this area. The yellow warning in parts of Scotland and northern Ireland. But those wins to go away quickly and Friday is a windy day with sunshine for a time before more wet weather arrives. That is from another storm which could give some problems on Saturday. There are a number of weather warnings in force. Back now to our main story tonight - the attack by gunmen believed to be Islamist extremists, on a satirical magazine on Paris which has left 12 people dead. Our correspondent joins us from Paris. A sombre atmosphere in Paris tonight. That gun attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo two blocks away behind me. People asking questions about the nature of the magazine. This is the latest addition out today. I should say Charlie Hebdojust doesn’t addition out today. I should say Charlie Hebdo just doesn’t target faith and religion is, is lamb, it has a go at Christians as well. -- is lamb. It is that freedom of expression and freedom of thought that French people are very keen to defend. It is one of the principles of the French Republic. That is the focus of tonight’s demonstration not far from here. focus of tonight’s demonstration not farfrom here. My far from here. My colleague is there to tell us more about that. Yes, we are ten minutes only from the site of the attack. As you were saying, thousands of people have gathered spontaneously. We have seen people draped in French colours and candles. There has been ripples of spontaneous applause. Very much a SpoI’1tSIâ1EOUS 3pplSUSE. VEI’y TT’IUCiâ1 S SEI’1SE spontaneous applause. Very much a sense here that however brutal this one attack, an act of mass murder in the French capital should not fundamentally change French values. We are going to hearfrom fundamentally change French values. We are going to hear from the French president in about half an hour and we expect him to echo those thoughts. Thank you very much. Continuing coverage on the BBC News Channel and updates all of the Tonight on BBC London News. Rail bosses say sorry to commuters for the chaos at London Bridge station. We absolutely apologise. We thought we would be presenting a new station and method of operation. After several months of misery leading up to it. That has not happened. But we’re told the answer to the problem is to cut the number of trains. Also tonight. Some of London’s A&E units are still struggling to cope. Today the Government’s been defending the capital’s health service. Terror police arrest a 40-year-old in Crawley. And an amazing survivor. Meet Reggie - the little boy who two years ago was given just hours to live. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Louisa Preston. They have been caused by huge rebuilding project that is used in the planning. The station has seen conic overcrowding during the evening rush. The chaos was caused because the new station could not cope with the number of trains. Tonight, they have cancelled several services. News that is likely to anger travellers. ~ I have just been I havejust been inside the I have just been inside the station, and there are a number of delays, and there is a lot of congestion, a lot of queueing. This whole episode has been extremely embarrassing for the whole rail industry. Commuters using London Bridge have not held back, condemning the disruption. Last night was no different. Again, there were long queues, delays, alterations and cancellations. Some saying the overcrowding was dangerous. I am really angry, because fares have been increased this year again, and I have been working here for eight years now, and it doesn’t ever seem to improve at all. It makes you think about leaving London. If you have a planned disruption, the planet and you don’t have the trains the first place. You don’t need to say they are cancelled. It could’ve been planned slightly better. There has been extensive rebuilding a planned disruption, the planet and you don’t have the trains advertised in the first place. You don’t need to say they are cancelled. It could’ve been planned slightly better. There has been extensive rebuilding and under bridge be intimated smoothly. The upgrade had been planned for years. I genuinely do not understand that when you have taken trains out of the timetable, why is it not what running like clockwork? Clearly, they have not got a grip of what is going wrong here themselves. They need a better plan for managing passengers in the station. There is already quite a healthy penalty structure in place, but what I care about is our people going to get checks, but is the whole organisation thinking about passengers? Network Rail says that the concourse will be modelled Ling remodelled by Friday to reduce the overcrowding. It also admits that the new infrastructure at the moment cannot cope with the number of trains. That means that there will be more cancellations tonight. Extremely embarrassing them that all this planning has led to a situation where you are reviewing the whole timetable? Indeed. Once we get through this, and we will get through it in the next 72 hours to the weekend, we just need to step back and see exactly how we have got into this situation, what has brought this. We believed in the execution in the work, and our plans are very tight, very thorough, we have been modelling this a number of times. What do you say to the commuters? I’m sorry. We absolutely apologise. We thought we would be ",,

The car stopped just across from where we were and two guys with black masks got out and fired with a Kalashnikov. As the scale of the atrocity became apparent, President Hollande and other world leaders said it was an attack on liberty and freedom of speech.

And tonight in the centre of Paris, a vigil to reinforce the Republic’s ideals of liberty and freedom. Also on the programme tonight, the continuing difficulties in Accident & Emergency. Labour and the Tories trade political blows about who’s to blame. And fresh concerns about Europe’s economy as eurozone prices fall, leading to deflation. Later on BBC London: Rail bosses apologise for chaos at London Bridge but say the answer is to cut the number of trains. And hundredsjoin a vigil in Trafalgar Square to remember those killed in Paris today. Good evening from Paris, where President Hollande has addressed the French nation on television, appealing for unity and solidarity after today’s terrorist attacks in the heart of the city. Ten journalists and two police officers were killed when gunmen broke into the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a well- known satirical magazine. In the past it’s been attacked for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The attacks took place just after 11am this morning near the Place de la Bastille and other famous Parisian landmarks. The gunmen are still at large. There were unconfirmed reports that the police have identified three men they want to find. Our first report by our Europe editor Gavin Hewitt does contain some distressing images of the attack. Paris mid-morning. Gunfire. Cries from the streets below. Two or three gunmen in balaclavas with assault rifles arrive at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. There are bursts of gunfire with people taking cover between cars. Five months later, the gunmen leave. They shoot an injured police officer in the head. Witnesses say the men shouted, we have avenged the Prophet Muhammad. They have spoken in flawless French. Their actions were controlled and deliberate and they had time to pick something up before they drove away. In the attack, 12 people were killed. Two of them police officers, the others were mainlyjournalists. TRANSLATION: I can still hear the shots ringing through my ears. I never would have believed I would hear shooting on my own street. Everyone was running away. I feel really scared. It is very frightening. This didn’tjust frightening. This didn’t just happen. frightening. This didn’tjust happen. It feels like a religious war. Wal’. TRANSLATION: war. TRANSLATION: We wanted to run there to see what was happening but when we realised the shots were coming from there, we hit instead. The magazine mocked politicians and religions and had been under police protection after it had published drawings of the Prophet Muhammad. Among those killed was Stephane Charbonnier, the paper’s editor, and his bodyguard. Also Georges Wolinski and jean Cabut. his bodyguard. Also Georges Wolinski andjean Cabut. In and jean Cabut. In France, they are describing this as the darkest day in the history of the French press. Sometime later, the French President Francois Hollande threaded his way past the ambulances to visit the scene of the attack. He said the killings were without doubt a terrorist operation and revealed that several other attacks have been prevented in recent weeks. TRANSLATION: We are threatened because we are a country of freedom and because we are a country of freedom we will be able to face these threats. We will punish the attackers. Nobody must think they can act against the principles of the French Republic. Later, appearing on French television, described the men and women killed as heroes who died for an idea of France. For freedom. The car used by the attackers was found abandoned in a northern Paris suburb. There is now huge police operation to try to find these men. The country has gone on the highest state of alert, with extra security on the Metro, at religious buildings and media offices. When President Hollande visited here earlier, he said it was a difficult national moment but he also spoke of the need to consider national unity, but France is a fiercely secular society and there are many here who argue that the freedom of the press is non-negotiable. Tonight, vigils for those who died and to defend the right to be irreverent, to offend and to mock, and on the streets, a nervous capital. The reaction here in France has been a powerful mix of anger and determination to pursue the gunmen, whoever they are, and to show that French ideals of liberty and freedom of speech are more important than ever. But the National Front has been more specific, talking of the need for urgency in combatting Islamist extremism. Our special correspondent Fergal Keane has been considering the reaction to today’s attack. A city shocked, struggling to understand, but also defiant. This was the reaction of citizens in the Republic square tonight. There was anger. angel’. TRANSLATION: I anger. TRANSLATION: I feel really sick. They thought they were avenging is long but it is the opposite. They have harmed French Muslims and also France itself. All evening, they came. In a city where free speech has been a rallying cry since the age of revolution. Among those here, Pascale Tournier, political writer and one of those who survived the attack. TRANSLATION: Currently attack. TRANSLATION: Currently in France there is a climate of Islam as phobia. The most important thing now is for unity and moderation and for politicians to put forward the principles of fraternity and liberty. France has millions of Muslim citizens. Many are integrated into French society but tensions over the role of Islam have sharpened in recent years. Along with that, resentment of policy in the Arab world has radicalised a lot of use. -- the Arab world has radicalised a lot of use. -- of French policy. This man speaks for a majority of moderate Muslims. TRANSLATION: Terrorism is not part of any education or part of our tradition. Our religion is one of peace and love. Travelling across this city tonight in the immediate aftermath of the attack, from poor to rich neighbourhoods, it is understandably the human rather than the pit-- political dimensions of the tragedy which dominate. But even among those most critical of growing is on influence in France, the rhetoric is careful. TRANSLATION: We need to fight against fundamentalism, against the radical speech and fundament -- against fundamentalism, against the radical speech and fundament -- in fundamentalist mosques. But it is important this is not blamed on our Muslim compatriots. When London was attacked by Islamic extremists a decade ago, there was a concerted effort by political and religious leaders and by ordinary citizens to prevent serious communal division. In France, the need for such a coming together has never been greater. The offices of Charlie Hebdo were a known target. Its editor had received numerous death threats in the past and was living under police protection. Questions are now being asked about the level of that protection. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner looks at the probable reasons behind the attack and the response to the terror threat. A brazen attack in broad daylight in a European capital. France had been on alert for something like this but nothing quite on this scale. The gun men, dressed in the manner of many jihadists in Syria and Iraq, appeared well trained. They fired single, well aimed shots and escaped from the scene unhindered. So why target France? The French state has been very confrontational in its approach towards Islamist ‘s and violent Islamist in particular. They have taken a very hard line on wearing the veil. So this country is seen at the forefront of the battle against Islam by the West and so it is a country that ranks as a high target by Islamist. Today’s attack did not come out of the blue. Over the last month they had been a number of less serious attacks by lone individual. Injune last year, police in Marseille arrested a jihadists with a machine gun. The same man had told four people in Brussels earlier. Over the Christmas period, France deployed troops in public places but that was clearly no deterrent to whoever carried out today’s attack. The satirical French magazine, Charlie Hebdo, has poked fun at every main religion, ignoring requests to tone down cartoons sample provocative. Insisting instead on the rights of free speech. It was firebombed in 2011, named as a target by Al-Qaeda in Yemen. This morning it treated a cartoon of an Islamic leader. The gun attack came one hour later but probably too soon to be linked. -- it treated. France, like Great Britain, has a major problem with jihadists going to Syria and back. It has more extremists fighting with Islamic State than any other European country. Mainstream doesn’t have condemned the attack. Some input and even further. -- mainstream Muslims. I would urge them to firmly state that is land, which is my faith, is open to as much scrutiny as any ideology. We cannot segregate Islam, quarantine it, from critique, especially when Muslims criticise all other religions as well. Today’s attack in Paris has disturbing echoes of the one in Mumbai in 2008. Once again, a small numberof one in Mumbai in 2008. Once again, a small number of heavily armed gunmen wreaked havoc in a city and once again, governments around the world will be asking themselves, how do we stop this happening here? Throughout the evening there have been quite a few unconfirmed reports that French police have identified three men that they would like to find. Some names also being circulated but nothing has been confirmed. Lots of the reports are being followed closely by those who have gathered at the Republic Place and our Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson is there to tell us more. Can you tell us about the state of this inquiry and what is going on? Well, as you were saying, tens of thousands of people turned out here tonight in central Paris to express their outrage at these attacks and it is a scene that has been mirrored in towns and cities across France. President Hollande in a televised address this evening called the victims heroes and said they for freedom. He has launched a massive manhunt to try to find their killers. The police are being very tight-lipped indeed and are not giving away any details of the operation but there are rumours emerging from the media here which are naming three male suspects. They say they are being chased by the police. Two of them are said to be French citizens but, as I say, those details are not being confirmed by the authorities and they are keeping a very tight-lipped on that operation. As things stand tonight, that Hunt is set to continue. -- operation. As things stand tonight, that Hunt is set to continue. -- a very tight lid. Thank you. Among the world leaders expressing outrage today was Chancellor Merkel of Germany. She was visiting London, where David Cameron also voiced his strong condemnation of today’s events in Paris. President Obama offered American help to bring the perpetrators to justice. Our political editor Nick Robinson has more on the political reaction to the attack. This was the day the leaders of two great European countries met in London. But the thoughts of David Cameron and Germany’s Angela Merkel will not here. They were in Paris. All our thoughts are with the French people following the barbaric attack this morning and we stand absolutely united with the French people against terrorism and against this threat to our values, free speech, the rule of law, democracy, and it is essential we defend those values today and every day. Before the news conference, the Prime Minister and Chancellor had a joint security briefing from the directors of MI5 and MI6. And then they spoke together to France’s President Hollande. TRANSLATION: It’s a moving moment when we were able to address the French President, Francois Hollande,,en the phone we French President, Francois Hollande, ,en the phone we assured him we would do everything we can in order to help them in this very desperate hour we stand by the French people. just unthe road in Trafalgar Square, another moving moment and people gathered to declare that the pen is mightier than the world or the gun. -- declare that the pen is mightier than the world or the gun. -- sword or the gun. than the world or the gun. -- sword orthe gun. People or the gun. People who remember all savage attacks in the name of radical Islam. Like that on 7/7, a decade ago, which scarred London, both underground and over it, killing 52, and injuring more than 700. America too has recent experience of homegrown terror, in the attack on the Boston Marathon, just two years ago. For us to see the kind of cowardly, evil attacks that took place today, I think we reinforces, once again, why it’s so important for us to stand in solidarity with them, just as they stand in solidarity with us. The Prime Minister said this attack was different to recent plots in the UK. Better planned, more professional, more brutal. Britain’s terror alert is already at ""severe"" meaning a terror attack isjudged is already at ""severe"" meaning a terror attack is judged to terror attack isjudged to be ""highly likely"". Tomorrow the Home Secretary chairs a meeting of police and security advisers to consider what other steps might be necessary. Other, who like those in Paris earn their living through sat is a, are defiant in the face of what they call - defiant in the face of what they call- antihuman terrorism. I think the best response, even in this moment of horror and tragedy, is to laugh them back into the dustbin of history, where they belong. For people standing here in Trafalgar Square tonight, in solidarity with those who died at Charlie Hebdo magazine, it’s not simply another appalling attack. It is not simply another dreadful loss of life. It is an attack, quite simply, on their values. Nick, Robinson, BBC News, Trafalgar Square. Nick Robinson BBC News Trafalgar Square. We will have more from Paris before the end of the programme. We willjoin you Fiona back in Huw, thank you London. Very much. Now today’s other news now: A political row has erupted about who’s to blame for the ongoing problems in UK Accident and Emergency wards. Today, at Prime Minister’s Questions, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, accused the Government of betraying patients, but David Cameron hit back saying Labour was using the NHS as a ""political football."" Eight hospitals in England have now declared ""major incidents"" in response to unprecedented demand on their Accident and Emergency departments. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, has more. Running at full stretch, record numbers of ambulance calls illustrate the intense demands on the NHS. We’ve been under extreme pressure for the last few weeks. We’ve put extra resources on to try and cope with the pressures but, obviously, with the delays we’re getting at the hospitals, it’s causing quite a few problems for ourselves. One of the main pressure points on the whole system is the increasing number of people arriving at hospital Accident & Emergency units and there’s a debate about precisely why that should be happening. Could the NHS 111 helpline, for example, be encouraging more patients to go to hospital? Good afternoon, you’re through to the NHS 111. Critics say 111 call operators have a list of questions which too often results in advice to go to a doctor or a call for an ambulance. Because it’s not run by health care professionals, it means that more of those patients are likely to be transferred onto other services and they’re likely, therefore, to turn up in places like A&E departments or indeed GP surgeries. But NHS chiefs deny that 111 has created new problems. We are confident that 111 categorically is not the problem behind the pressures that have been seen in A&E. In fact, it’s one of the clear elements to solve the issue in the long-term. It takes away the demand. It’s notjust about people going into hospital, but what happens when they come out, with problems in some cases finding places in local communities where patient’s treatment can be continued. Social care is under strain, so discharges of patients can be delayed. BBC News today contacted 64 NHS Trusts and Boards around the UK to ask the number of beds unavailable due to delayed transfers. Around half responded. More than 2,200 beds were occupied by patients ready for discharge. This included nearly 200 beds, 20% of its total at Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge. We have got a problem with people who have finished their care here. Who have finished their medical treatment, their acute care, and are waiting to go back into the community, either to a home or to another community resource, and putting packages in place for that number of people, with that complexity of illness, is providing a challenge. The current state of the NHS dominated Prime Minister’s Questions. I think that is disgraceful. The NHS is not a weapon, it’s a way we care for our families. It’s a way we care for the elderly. It’s a way we look after the frail. So, perhaps, when he gets to his feet, he will deny that he said he wanted to weaponise the NHS, a disgusting thing to say. I’ll tell him what’s disgusting. It’s a Prime Minister who said people could put their trust in him on the NHS, and he has betrayed that trust. It’s the middle of winter, the election’s not far off. The debate over the NHS won’t ease off any time soon. Hugh Pym, BBC News. As we saw earlier, the German Chancellor has been meeting David Cameron today in London. As well as events in Paris, they were discussing the UK’s future in Europe. Angela Merkel made it clear she’s not prepared to compromise on freedom of movement in the EU. Let’s talk to our deputy political editor, james Landale, who’s in Downing Street. So what else did the two leaders have to say? David Cameron wants to reform the ech U. To do that he needs the support of Angela Merkel. Today, she gave him rhetorical comfort, if you like. She said she was ready to seek common solutions. Where there is will there is a way, she said. They were clear limits. She said there could be no questioning in anyway of the principle of free move am of people in Europe. She declined an invitation to agree with David Cameron that all of these reforms need big treaties to EU treaties. The Prime Minister adopted a pro-European tone, albeit without changing his position. He repeatedly supported free movement of people. He said the right answer to this is not leaving the EU, it’s reforming the EU and staying in it after a referendum. Tonight, Downing Street quietly content with the way these talks have gone on. I think, Mrs Merkel has not said nearly enough to convince eurosceptic MPs or voters that she will back the Prime Minister all the way on this. There is a long way to go here. OK, james Landale, outside NumberTen, thank you. The Eurozone has entered negative inflation, or deflation, for the first time since the global recession of 2009, prompting fears that Europe’s faltering economic recovery could be set back still further. Prices in the 19 states which use the euro fell by 0.2% in December, compared to the previous year, mainly because of the dramatic fall in oil prices. From Madrid, Tom Burridge reports. Today, in Spain, the post-Christmas sales officially began, but throughout the past year this woman has been cutting prices in her shop and making regular special offers to tempt people to buy. TRANSLATION: I have lots of customers who’ve lost theirjobs or had their wages cut. They’re very sensitive to prices. Things have to be cheap. Things are generally getting cheaper across the Eurozone. Over the past three years, inflation has gradually fallen. Today, it dropped below zero, meaning prices are actually going down. The main cause, the global price of oil. Today, Brent crude dropped below $50 a barrel for the first time in nearly six years. But prices on other goods are falling too. Like food, at this Madrid market. On average, prices have been cut quicker in Spain than in other parts of Europe. It sounds like good news. The trouble is, if prices will be lower tomorrow, then why buy something today? If that mentality sets in, it could create a cycle, where by people delay spending and businesses are forced to slash prices even further. Result, an economic downturn across the Eurozone. With the Eurozone being Britain’s biggest trading partner, another slow down here is bad news back home. Amid sluggish growth, and now deflation, Europe’s Central Bank is soon to expected a large scale stimulus. This analyst believes today’s figures will strengthen the hand of the bank’s boss. Mario Draghi is, sort of, raising the ghost of deflation because he has another aim, and that is to be allowed to have quantitative easing, which means to allow the central bank, the European Central Bank, to print money, in ordinary terms. And, he knows that there’s a lot of resistance to that, from the point of view of Germany, Holland, the Netherlands and Finland, and others. Many in those countries believe the answer lies in Spain. The government here has pushed through unpopular economic reforms and there are now tentative signs of a recovery. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in Madrid. The World Health Organisation says there are signs the number of Ebola cases may have levelled off in Sierra Leone, though it is still by far the worst country affected. The safe burial of victims is an essential step towards controlling and ending the epidemic. The bodies of the dead are particularly infectious, but traditional ceremonies involve washing loved ones before laying them to rest. Our global health correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, has spent the day with the Red Cross burial team in Sierra Leone. She sent this report. The body collectors of Freetown, getting ready for another harrowing day at work. They’ve been doing this for months now. Beneath these intimidating suits, teachers, students, ordinary Sierra Leoneans are volunteering to take on this unrelenting fight against Ebola. We sympathies with the family. But this is just as important. Talking to the community so they understand why removing bodies this way is so crucial. Also we have to tell them about the dangers of this epidemic, which is Ebola, because some people are still denying. They are full of denial. So we have to tell them that it is real and they should have to follow what are the principles. The team brace themselves, and head in. Alpha died in the early hours of this morning, according to his family. Swab teams have already been inside to get samples to confirm whether this was an Ebola death, but almost every death now in the home has to be treated as Ebola. If it is confirmed, the rest of this community remains at risk. In the next village, another heartbreaking scene. A three-week-old baby died late last night. His name was Alpha. Health workers say it’s unlikely to be Ebola, but they can’t take any risks. It’s very difficult work for you? Yeah, of course. Very difficult. Very difficult work. We are doing it for the country. How many bodies do you think you’ve collected like this? Hundreds of bodies. When you go home, do you think about the day? Do you have dreams about what you’ve seen? Sometimes. Sometimes I pray. If I go to bed, I pray, you know. Sometimes I think over things, while I get over them, you know. Another home, another body, another distraught daughter. Basi Carbow died after showing classic symptoms of Ebola. This is the fourth body that the burial team here has come to collect in as many hours. It’s the body of 37-year-old Henry Cisse, he complained of feeling unwell over the weekend. Then, by yesterday, last night in fact, he was dead. Here’s how the day ends at the capital’s main cemetery. Baby Alpha is laid to rest. His father whispering a solemn prayer. Tulip Mazumdar, BBC News, Freetown. More now on our top story and the terror attack on a satirical magazine in Paris, which has left 12 people and the three gunmen still on the loose. Let’s go back to Huw in Paris. Fiona, thank you very much. The a moss fear here in Paris late Attapatu night is very sombre. It’s very thoughtful and pen sieve. People very keen though to follow the progress of the police investigation. That does seem to be moving pretty rapidly tonight as well. Though, asl moving pretty rapidly tonight as well. Though, as I say, reports that people have been found, three men have been found, are not being confirmed yet. Our Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt is here with me in Paris. He has been following this train of I vents throughout the day. A quick word about the investigation, then you’re sense of the imle pact of what has happened today? First of all, it’s a large operation going on tonight. They do believe that they may have identified three suspects, two of them in their 30s, identified three suspects, two of them in their30s, one 18, two identified three suspects, two of them in their 30s, one 18, two of them of Algerian dissent, this hasn’t been confirmed. We are also hearing that two houses are being searched and that one area, there is a great deal of police activity there. Let us move on to the wider picture here. This is a time of great sensitivity. Listening to President Hollande today, and in every statement he made, he stressed the need for unity. Why? There are six million Muslims in this country. It’s 10% of the poch layings. He knows no progress can be made without keeping moderate Muslim opinion on board. Also at this time, the far right here is performing strongly, particularly because there is a stagnant economy, and a weak President. It was interesting tonight, at some of these demonstrations, alongside the candles people were laying down pencils. Why? Because they see this as a struggle to defend very basic freedoms. These are testing days for the French Republic. Gavin, thank you very much indeed. Gavin Hewitt there, our Europe editor. More events from Paris on the BBC News Channel and the BBC website. Plenty updates to follow. Now we join the news teams where you are. Goodbye for now. Good evening, welcome to BBC London News, I’m Louisa Preston. Thousands of commuters who use London Bridge station have endured their third consecutive evening of major problems. They’re being caused by a huge rebuilding project which has been years in the planning. Since work began on Monday, the station has seen chronic overcrowding and delays during the evening rush. The rail boss in charge has told BBC London the chaos was caused because the new station can’t cope with the number of trains. Tonight, more services were cancelled.

11,BBC1 London,7-jan-2015,BBC London News,22:30,10 mins,True,"Fiona, thank you very much. The a moss fear here in Paris late Attapatu night is very sombre. It’s very thoughtful and pen sieve. People very keen though to follow the progress of the police investigation. That does seem to be moving pretty rapidly tonight as well. Though, asl moving pretty rapidly tonight as well. Though, as I say, reports that people have been found, three men have been found, are not being confirmed yet. Our Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt is here with me in Paris. He has been following this train of I vents throughout the day. A quick word about the investigation, then you’re sense of the imle pact of what has happened today? First of all, it’s a large operation going on tonight. They do believe that they may have identified three suspects, two of them in their 30s, identified three suspects, two of them in their30s, one 18, two identified three suspects, two of them in their 30s, one 18, two of them of Algerian dissent, this hasn’t been confirmed. We are also hearing that two houses are being searched and that one area, there is a great deal of police activity there. Let us move on to the wider picture here. This is a time of great sensitivity. Listening to President Hollande today, and in every statement he made, he stressed the need for unity. Why? There are six million Muslims in this country. It’s 10% of the poch layings. He knows no progress can be made without keeping moderate Muslim opinion on board. Also at this time, the far right here is performing strongly, particularly because there is a stagnant economy, and a weak President. It was interesting tonight, at some of these demonstrations, alongside the candles people were laying down pencils. Why? Because they see this as a struggle to defend very basic freedoms. These are testing days for the French Republic. Gavin, thank you very much indeed. Gavin Hewitt there, our Europe editor. More events from Paris on the BBC News Channel and the BBC website. Plenty updates to follow. Now we join the news teams where you are. Goodbye for now. Good evening, welcome to BBC London News, I’m Louisa Preston. Thousands of commuters who use London Bridge station have endured their third consecutive evening of major problems. They’re being caused by a huge rebuilding project which has been years in the planning. Since work began on Monday, the station has seen chronic overcrowding and delays during the evening rush. The rail boss in charge has told BBC London the chaos was caused because the new station can’t cope with the number of trains. Tonight, more services were cancelled. Our transport correspondent Tom Edwards reports. Commuters using London Bridge have not held back condemning the disruption. And last night was no different. Again, there were long queues, delays, alterations and cancellations, some saying the overcrowding was dangerous. Well, I’m very angry because fares have been increased this year again and I’ve been working here for eight years now and it doesn’t seem to improve...at all. So it makes you think about living London. If you’re going to plan disruption then you plan it and you don’t have trains advertised in the first place and then you don’t need to say they’re cancelled. So it could have been planned slightly better. There has been extensive rebuilding a London Bridge over Christmas. New platforms and new signalling were meant to be introduced smoothly. The upgrade had been planned for years. I genuinely do not understand when you’ve taken trains out of the timetable and closed for two weeks over Christmas and have done all this work, why it isn’t running like clockwork. Clearly they have not got a grip of what is going wrong here themselves. They certainly need a better plan for managing passengers in the station. There’s already quite a healthy penalty structure in place but actually what I care about is not, are people going to get checks? It is, is the whole organisation thinking about passengers? Network Rail says the concourse will be remodelled by Friday to reduce the overcrowding. It also admits the new infrastructure at the moment can’t cope with the number of trains. And that means more cancellations tonight. Extremely embarrassing, then, that all this planning has to a situation where you are reviewing the whole timetable? Indeed. Indeed. And once we get through this, and we will get through it in the next 72 hours to the weekend, we need to just step back and see exactly how we have got into this situation. What has caused this? Because we believed, and the execution of the work has kind of proved it, that our plans were tight and thorough and we have been modelling this for a while. What do you say to commuters? I’m sorry. We absolutely apologise. We thought we would be presenting a new station and new method of operation after several months of misery leading up to it and that hasn’t happened. I am deeply regretful for that. The man meets with rail bosses tomorrow. Commuters will be nervous but even more changes are planned at London Bridge next week. Tom Edwards, BBC London News. Well, the mayor Borisjohnson is meeting transport bosses tomorrow to discuss the travel disruption at London Bridge. And you can get all the latest travel information on our radio station BBC London 94.9, and on our website. A murder investigation has been launched after a teenager died from stab wounds in East London. Police were called to Homerton High Street shortly before midnight last night but the boy, who’s believed to have been in his mid-teens, was pronounced dead at the scene. Tonight the Met said it’s referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. No arrests have been made. Small businesses in the capital say they’re concerned that plans to improve air quality by charging drivers in central London could costjobs and damage trade. The Ultra Low Emission Zone could be introduced in 2020, meaning anyone with a vehicle that doesn’t meet strict exhaust emission standards would have to pay. A verdict of accidental death has been recorded after a Colchester pensioner died on board a cruise ship last Valentine’s Day. 85-year-old james Swinstead was travelling with his wife on the Marco Polo. The inquest heard the vessel was caught up in a storm in the English Channel when a freak wave dislodged a window frame which then struck Mr Swinstead. An actor who appeared in a james Bond film and the Star Wars movies has died during a rehearsal for a play in East London. Kan Bonfils was rehearsing at The Rag Factory in Shoreditch when he collapsed on Monday. Hundreds of people have gathered in Trafalgar Square tonight to remember those who’ve been killed in Paris today in an apparent Islamist attack at the offices of a satirical French magazine. Tarah Welsh reports. Trafalgar Square this evening. Hundreds here for those murdered today in Paris. They held pens, pencils and notebooks to show their support for free speech. I really felt like I had to come because I have some family in Paris and because I’m French and irony felt that... What happened was atrocious and I was in the car with my friend coming back to London and we were in Paris this morning and we were really in shock. The French anthem was played and people held signs saying ""I am Charlie"". journalists, free speech campaigners and those who were simply sad and shocked came here tonight. I was very horrified when I heard. Iwas here tonight. I was very horrified when I heard. I was in my daughter’s house and I saw it on the tablet and all afternoon I was thinking about that. The editor in chief was actually in London when the attack happened today. He has said, I don’t understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war. Many people tonight have agreed with that, including those here in Trafalgar Square. That’s it for now from me. Let’s find out what the weather’s up to. Pretty mild for the next couple of days. Some rain around at the moment but it does look as though it will improve for tomorrow. A cloudy start but a brighter one eventually. The rain is weakening all the time as it pushes south and east. It looks scary at the moment but bits and pieces of heavy rain through the night and it will start to ease away. The heaviest bursts through the south of the Thames but the cloud and rain mean it won’t be a cold night. Lows of seven - cloud and rain mean it won’t be a cold night. Lows of seven - eight. A pretty grey note tomorrow morning and the early birds will see some outbreaks of light showers. Towards the latter stages of the morning and into the afternoon, they will clear and once we have that out of the way, some lovely sunshine coming through in the afternoon. Very pleasant indeed. A light westerly breeze with temperatures at ten or 11. All change as we move Friday into Saturday. The wind will be quite a feature but it will be mild for the time of year. Good evening. Wet and windy for many tonight. Bright and breezy for most tomorrow. But tomorrow for some of us it is the calm before the storm. Two bouts of very windy weather to hit particularly the northern half of the UK in the coming days and we are expecting some problems, particularly from the first of those storms, which is this area clearing away from North America currently. It will be knocking on our doors this time tomorrow. Cloudy with outbreaks of rain continuing to spread southwards. For the North, turning colder and colder than for snow showers across the hills and mountains of Scotland and cold enough potentially for things to turn a bit icy as temperatures dropped well down to single figures. Further south, stay mild with the wet and windy weather of which there is still some left tomorrow morning. There could be heavy bursts, in fact, in this showery area of wet weather across southern areas for a time tomorrow morning before it scoots away around lunch time. More showers over Scotland still falling as snow over the hills. A few showers elsewhere but mostly bright and breezy with temperatures at six to 9 degrees. Maybe double digits in the south-west. Tomorrow night we need to look to the far north-west. That area of cloud I showed you is an intensifying area of low pressure. Getting quite lively as it gets to the north of the UK tomorrow night. Look at the isobars. This is Friday morning. Very strong winds across the northern half of the UK. We are looking at costs across Scotland on parts of Northern Ireland at 60-70 miles an hour so we have a yellow warning in force. For parts of north-west Scotland, the Western Isles and orkney, those could get to 90 or possibly 100 miles an hour, so we have a ""be prepared"" amber warning. miles an hour, so we have a ""be prepared"" amberwarning. So prepared"" amber warning. So we could have problems on Friday morning. It will be a blustery start wherever you are. But those violent winds should come down quite quickly. We are left with a windy day with spells of rain from the West. Temperatures quite mild. But this next area of rain is another deepening area of low pressure. This is slightly bigger and perhaps further north but, again, it is re-intensifying as it moves over Scotland. # Dance, jump on it # If you sexy, then flaunt it # If you freaky, then own it # Don’t brag about it Come show me... # Oi! # Come on, dance #jump on it # If you sexy, then flaunt it... # Thanks. # Well it’s Saturday night and we in the spot # Don’t believe me, just watch Come on! # Don’t believe me, just watch. # Get closer to BBC Radio 1 on BBC iPlayer.

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The Italian coastguard has taken control of a merchant ship carrying more than 400 migrants that’s adrift in the Mediterranean without any crew on board. The Ezadeen is currently off the southern tip of Italy after being abandoned by a crew of people smugglers. It’s thought there could be as many as 450 people on board. Earlier this week, the Italian coastguard took control of another ship which was abandoned by human traffickers. Our Correspondent, james Reynolds, reports from Brindisi. At night, off the southern tip of Italy, the country’s Coastguard takes control of the drifting Ezadeen, apparently abandoned by its crew of smugglers. Those smugglers left hundreds of migrants on board expecting them to be picked up by the coastguard. You are watching the climax of what appears to be a successful smuggling operation. The Ezadeen has now been towed to an Italian port by an Icelandic battle, part of the EU’s border force. TRANSLATION: everybody on board is well, people are quiet and we are heading towards the north-west. The migrants found may, in the end, be the lucky ones. The desperate voyage from the middle east across these waters to Europe has become the most dangerous migrantjourney in the world. Last year, more than 3000 people drowned trying to get here. This is the second time this week the Italian authorities have had to intercept a migrant ship abandoned by its crew. On Tuesday night, the coastguard tug over a cargo vessel carrying Co8StgU8Iâd tUg OVEF B CBFQO vessel C8I’I’yiI’Ig ITIOI’â carrying more than 700 migrants from the Middle East. The influx is growing. In 2013, 60,000 migrants reached Europe. Last year by September, the number doubled to more than 130,000. Of these, 10,000 were unaccompanied or separated children. People who are desperate will always find a way to find safety and if they can come through the door-- if they cannot come through the door, they will come through the window. We need to find legal ways for refugees to come to Europe. In the case of the Brindisi, the risk appears to have paid off. The migrants have made it into the hands of the coastguard. Rail passengers in England and Wales face average fare rises of 2.2% from today after a Christmas period marked by chaotic scenes resulting from widespread cancellations and delays. The increase is the lowest annual rise for five years. Our transport correspondent Richard Westcott reports. Rail passengers did not have the happiest Christmas. Thousands were stranded by engineering problems in London that have cost the Network Rail boss his bonus. Now it is time for the annual fare rise. Tickets will be 2.2% more expensive, although the price set by the government including season tickets, are going up by 2.5%. It is the lowest increase since the coalition took power but it follows years of above inflation rises. The season ticket from Cambridge to London has gone up by £824 since 2010. A season ticket from Newcastle to Middlesbrough is £483 more expensive. On board the 8:15am from Cambridge this morning, regular commuters had mixed views. They think they can get away with it because there is no other way of getting to work. I cannot drive so people like myself have got to get the train. If I calculate the cost of travelling in by the car. I don’t own a car, it is not too much difference. At the moment I think I am getting value for money. I used to live north of Cambridge which was more expensive so we made the decision to move closer to London which has cut down my commuting time but also reduced the fair. I pay more for my train expenses than I do for my living arrangements. The government gets criticised every time it puts prices up, so why does it keep doing it? Nobody likes to see increases, I wish they were not necessary. We are investing records amount into the industry. Over the next four years, 38 .5 billion pounds will be spent. Major reinvestment as far as Birmingham new Street is concerned. Stations across the country are seeing that investment. Labour says it would do things differently. The people who have the least voice in the running of our railways is the public and thatis of our railways is the public and that is something Ed Miliband is determined to change. If you have a strong passenger voice you will not have the rip-off railways like you have under David Cameron. Where does the money go? For every £1 spent on a ticket 47p goes to staff and maintaining the track. 26p goes on things like this. This is the brand-new, soon to station at Northampton. After fuel, the cost of leasing the trains and servicing the debt leaves 3p in the pound as the average profit for the train companies. The government wants passengers to pay a bigger share of the rail will so prices look set to carry on. And Richard is at Kings Cross station. In terms of popularity weeks, this has not been a good one for the industry? It hasn’t, but the numbers of people using the train are reaching record levels. We have had decades worth of increases more than inflation. But successive governments think it is not putting people off travelling. They can have this weeks but it is not putting people off catching a train. OK, thank you very much. It’s only the second day of the New Year but already the starting gun has been fired in what will be a five-month long election campaign. David Cameron launched the first, of what will be many, posters saying that May’s election will be the most important in a generation. Meanwhile Ed Balls has dismissed concerns that Labour has shifted to the left, insisting it is the Tories who have ""lurched to the right"" abandoning the political centre ground. Our political correspondent Chris Mason reports. So, here we go. The sun was barely UP So, here we go. The sun was barely up on the first working day of the year and the Conservatives were out with their advertising ban. Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy, was the slogan. Stay on the road, the van certainly did. And the word tumbled out of the Prime Minister’s mouth on a visit to Halifax in West Yorkshire. When you are on the road to eliminating the deficit, don’t turn back. When you are on the road to greater security for our country, don’t turn back. I am not saying we have sold all of the problems in the last five years, but we have created jobs, turned the economy round, cut the deficit in half, improved skills in our schools. Meanwhile, Labour claimed in the Guardian, the Conservative plans for spending cuts were extreme and ideological and went beyond the necessary task of deficit reduction. I think the Conservatives want to give the impression they are on a particular road. But their road has turned sharply to the right. In the Autumn statement they left the centre ground of British politics and has set out this policy to shrink public services to 35% of national income. It is an ideological and dogmatic step from the Chancellor too far. With four months and five days to go, expect plenty more days like this with poster launches, newspaper articles attempting to poster launches, newspaper articles attempting to twist our arms. The Lib Dems and Ukip will have plenty to say, as will others. A lot of it will be on the central battle ground of the economy. And this on a day when Westminster is still quiet. It is going to get rather busy. Most types of cancer are the result of bad luck and not through unhealthy lifestyle choices such as smoking. That’s according to new research from the United States which looked at 31 different types of cancer and found that the majority were caused by chance mutations that could not be prevented. But around a third, including lung and skin cancer, did have links to lifestyle or genetic factors. Our health correspondent Adam Brimelow reports. We all want to reduce the risk of getting cancer. We know cutting out cigarettes, eating well and being active can help. But there are no guarantees. Some types of body tissue are more vulnerable to cancer than others. Breach versus say it is because a replacement rate of old tired sales of new ones by dividing stem cells. Each time they divide, there is a risk of a cancer-causing mutation. This study suggests most types of cancers can be put down to bad luck. As many as two in three are down to chance mutations which cannot be avoided. They include the most aggressive brain tumour and a type of pancreatic cancer. But some of the most deadly cancers including skin cancerand lung of the most deadly cancers including skin cancer and lung cancer are him -- heavily influenced by lifestyle. We should not be throwing our New Year revolutions out of the window, but you need to make choices like not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, healthy diet and cutting back on alcohol. Some UK cancer experts said the highlight studies the importance of further research to find better ways of detect in cancer early. Rather than preventing cancer early. Rather than preventing cancer by lifestyle changes, can we pick cancer up earlier? That should be the conclusion, better detection tests, spend time and money on developing new ways of picking up cancer from a simple blood test in a GP surgery. There is no suggestion here lifestyle isn’t important in causing or preventing cancer, but it underlines the need to fight the battle on many fronts. The Liverpool football captain Steven Gerrard has announced he will leave the club at the end of the season. He called the decision ""the toughest"" of his life. The 34-year-old midfielderjoined the club aged eight and has scored 180 goals in 695 games. Gerrard’s contract runs out in the summer and it’s thought he will announce a move to major league soccer in America. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss is at Anfield. What will his legacy be? Steven Gerrard was just a schoolboy when he joined the youth system. He has blossomed into one of England’s most famous players. Finally, this club, which has been his home for so many years is preparing for life without him. A brief hello before the long goodbye. Steven Gerrard arriving for training this morning but also to confirm the end of an era. In the fickle world of football, he has been the rarity, a1 fickle world of football, he has been the rarity, a 1 club wonder, Liverpool pull -- been the rarity, a 1 club wonder, Liverpool pull -- Liverpool for life, captain. But he has announced this will be his last season at Anfield. In a statement he announced: At Anfield, where Steven Gerrard has been a towering presence for so long, fans paid tribute. Gutted, but it is probably the right time for him to go, so he doesn’t do a Frank Lampard and go somewhere else in England. His best days are behind him but he has been a great servant here. Don’t Lane him. He is getting on a bit. He has had a good run and I’m sure he will be back for coaching or doing something else with the team. Statistics speak for themselves. He has played 695 times for Liverpool over 17 years and scored 180 goals, helping them to win ten trophies, most as captain. He was still scoring yesterday, twice in Liverpool’s draw with Leicester. With first-team opportunities limited, many believe he has made the right decision. He has been Liverpool’s best ever midfield player. The second best player Liverpool has had after Kenny Dalglish. He won the Champions League in 2005 but never the Premier League. A rare regrets, but his status as a Liverpool legend is undimmed. Soon to be gone, but never forgotten. Steven Gerrard says a move abroad looks likely, perhaps to America, where David Beckham finished his career. But he has also said that he would one day like to come back to Anfield in some other capacity, perhaps as coach, or even manager. The fans here will be hoping they have not seen the last of him. Our top story this lunchtime: Abandoned at sea - another ship is left to drift with hundreds of refugees on board off the coast of Italy. Coming up, petrol at 100 and 7p for some. How long before it drops below £1 a litre? Later on BBC London: A man has died in a block of flats in New Cross after it was evacuated due to fumes from a drain cleaning product. And ahead of this weekend’s third round of the FA Cup, how today’s Clapham Rovers once won the cup back in 1880. Yesterday marked 30 years since the first ever mobile phone call was made in Britain, but there are still some places in the UK that don’t have any coverage. Last month, plans were announced to tackle those so-called ""not spots"", but many people who live in them think action is long overdue. Tim Muffett has been to meet some of the people who are struggling to get a signal. Mobile phones were first rolled out 30 years ago. But sometimes Christopher Wallace feels communication has barely improved. He sells curtains and blinds in Newry in Northern Ireland. With the poor signal, we get a lot of customers complaining that they can never get hold of us. In the shop, it is OK. If I travel one mile any direction from here, the signal suddenly becomes diabolical. In the district of Newry and Mourne, 11% of premises have no mobile phone signal, according to Ofcom. It is one of the worst performing local authorities in the UK. If you look at my phone, it says ""network loss"". At this point, I am about 1.3 miles from our shop. How frustrating is that? It drives you mad at times. Things are tough enough. We’re trying to do business, keep employment, grow our business. You cannot get hold of your customers, customers cannot get hold of you. It is a massive issue for local people. It affects their day-to-day lives. Mobile coverage is something we need to contact our friends. It is almost a right for people. Unfortunately, we have been discriminated against, in my opinion. Areas with no mobile signals are known as not spots. 11% of the UK is classified as such. Most of that is rural, much is uninhabited. The proportion of UK premises in not spots is about 2%. More common are what are known as partial not spots, where not all mobile phone networks are available. Sometimes only one is. According to Ofcom, 16% of UK premises fall within that category. The four main mobile networks have promised to boost coverage in rural areas. £5 billion of investment has been pledged, although one idea, to allow users to switch from one network to another if theirs is not available, has been rejected. Coverage in towns and cities is generally better. But many still find that their signal can drop out unexpectedly. It depends on demand. Effectively, you divide the whole world into cells. If you move to a cell next door, you disconnect from the first cell and you connect to the base station in the next cell. It changes size slightly, depending on demand. When you are positioned between two cells, your signal can cut out, even in areas with good mobile coverage. If it sounds complicated, just wait. Nowadays, there are about five billion mobile devices. It is expected that this will be several trillion devices in ten or 20 years. This is a first generation mobile phone. As challenges for network providers increase, so technology will inevitably improve, hopefully at the same rate. In 30 years’ time, today’s smartphones may well look as dated as this. The search for AirAsia flight OZ8510, which crashed into the java Sea on Sunday, will move underwater with the arrival of specialist equipment. A crash investigation team will use sensitive acoustic detection devices to try to locate the plane’s ""black box"" flight recorder. The plane was flying from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore with 162 people on board when it went down. 30 bodies have been recovered so far. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes sent this report. This US Navy helicopter is carrying the latest bodies to be recovered from the AirAsia crash site, out in the java Sea. Standing by on the tarmac, Indonesian stretcher teams rushed to remove the body bags and take them to a nearby hospital. This scene has been repeated three times here today. These latest bodies were found by the US Navy ship, the USS Sampson. They were more than 30 miles away from other bodies found by a Malaysian Navy ship yesterday. That could mean that the bodies had drifted on strong sequence, which could mean that the debris field from the crash is much bigger than originally thought. Meanwhile, in Surabaya today, three more bodies recovered earlier were maimed and handed over to relatives. There is now a steady trickle of bodies being identified and returned -- now a steady trickle of bodies being identified and returned -- the bodies were maimed and handed to relatives. But the vast majority of families are still waiting. Some are hoping for a miracle, families are still waiting. Some are hoping fora miracle, othersjust hoping to get the bodies of their loved ones back so that they can be given proper burial. TRANSLATION: I am not interested in going there. Yesterday, they asked me if I want to go there. You see the bad weather. Our search and rescue teams have already done a good job. What’s more, there is assistance from other countries with advanced technology. But despite dozens of ships and aircraft scouring the java Sea, there was still no scene of the main part of the plane’s wreckage, and still no signal detected from the plane’s rack boxes. When they found the first wreckage, off the coast here on Tuesday, there was a sense of optimism that it would just be a few days before the rest of the plane was located. Now, the mood is much more pessimistic. They are now talking of at least a week or maybe more before they find the plane and the black boxes. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, in Indonesia. Could the price of petrol fall below one pound this year for the first time since 2009? Some industry experts are predicting just that, due to the combined effects of plunging world oil prices and increased competition between supermarkets at the petrol pumps. Our business correspondent Simon Gompertz is at a petrol station in East London. What are we likely to see? At the moment, we can see 107.7 at this supermarket. Supermarkets are driving the price down. Not everyone is getting that. 100 and 12p is the average. Some say they are paying well over 20p a litre for unleaded. Of course, diesel drivers are paying more. But the direction is downwards, and some forecasters suggest that in a fortnight’s time, some garages could have £1 a litre on the front, and people paying a lot less. What is behind it is the oil price, which has halved since September to $57 a barrel today. The forecasters are suggesting that a few more dollars could come off in the next few weeks. But for the average to get down to £1 a litre, from £1.12, you would need a more stand should drop in your oil price to $45 a barrel. The burnt-out wreck of the Norman Atlantic ferry is being towed back to Italy for an inspection aimed at establishing the full scale of the disaster that killed 13 people. There are fears the final toll could be higher amid uncertainty over how many people were actually on board. Payday loans should be cheaper from today. The City regulated enforcing a cap which will mean people will not pay back more than double what they originally borrowed. The new rules are part of a clamp-down on payday lenders, but there are fears that some borrowers could go to unrelated noted loan sharks instead. In the past, if you borrowed £250 for a month at an APR of 4000%, you would pay £675 in interest. But if you did not repay it all on time, the interest would mushroom to almost £12,000 within a year. Now, there is a cap on interest rates of 0.8% per day, and you will not have to pay any more in interest than you originally borrowed. That means that in this case, you would pay six to £1 after a month and a maximum of £250 after a year. Our research from last year clearly showed that for some borrowers, the effect of taking out a payday loan was driving them deeper into debt. The cap is structured to avoid that problem in the future. The SCA took over the issue in 2014, and what an impact it has had. In that time, the payday lending market has halved, and could shrink further in 2015 as these new caps come into force. But the Financial Conduct Authority cannot limit for ever the demand for short-term, high-cost credit. Consumer finance Association which represents payday lenders the Financial Conduct Authority does not want to force people already in financial difficulties into the arms of illegal loan sharks. joe Lynam, BBC News. A plane with 28 people on board made an emergency landing at Southend Airport this morning. Police and fire crews were scrambled for an emergency response as a precaution over fears of a fire in an engine. But the Blue Island flight from jersey, which had been headed for London City Airport, landed safely. And at Stornoway Airport on the Isle of Lewis, two passengers suffered minor injuries when their aircraft was blown off the runway. It is thought the Loganair flight to Glasgow, operated by Flybe, may have been caught in strong crosswinds. A crash investigation is underway and work is going on to clear the runway. It’s every treasure hunter’s dream. A hoard of coins, dating back a thousand years, has been found in a field in Buckinghamshire. It was discovered by Paul Coleman, who found them buried two feet underground using a metal detector. The 5,000 coins could be worth more than a million pounds. Robert Hall has more. Under the Underthe green Buckinghamshire, a metal detector is’s dream. When the weekend one boroughs’ club planned their Christmas expedition, they could never have imagined how the day would unfold. One member took these pictures as a crowd formed to see the first handful of coins surface. First of all, all we could see was a lead container. just a few coins showing, but they had been neatly stacked, so the conclusion was that this could be a big find. So we started to get the basic shape of what was underneath the ground. Then we started to get more involved. As the minutes passed, it became clear that this was something extraordinary, layers of coins, mostly in pristine condition, wrapped in a lead container. First tens, then hundreds, then thousands. The award was massive. It was about 5200 silver coins. As far as we can tell, this is probably the second largest amount of Anglo-Saxon coins everfound, much larger than ever found, much larger than anything everfound, much larger than anything we have seen before. The coins, Milton -- anything we have seen before. The coins, Milton -- minted in the realm of Ethelred the unready and King Canute, are now in the British Museum for a detailed examination. There are thought to be at worth at least £1.5 million. So how did they get there? With a hidden from Viking invaders? Did they come from the warming in Buckingham, orwere invaders? Did they come from the warming in Buckingham, or were they simply buried within a Saxon settlement? There are so many questions, and this find has created a story which has barely begun. Robert Holl, BBC News, Buckinghamshire. There are sparkling sunshine today for most of us, bar a bit of trouble and change over the weekend. Saturday is looking drab again for many. The cloud will bring outbreaks of rain for a time, but then we switch back to something drier and brighter, but chilly once again for the second half of the weekend. We had a lot of cloud yesterday. The remnants of that have been clearing away towards the south, leaving sunshine behind. If you take a wider look out, you can see the cloud heading our way for tonight and tomorrow. Ahead of that, a bright day for most. A chilly day across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England, thanks to the brisk wind from the West. Still a few showers of snow across higher ground in Scotland. They will fade away. Light winds across central and southern parts of England and Wales. Not feeling too bad. Temperatures will dip for time this evening. Another spell of snow across northern Scotland. Very strong winds for a time as well. They will ease later overnight, but then we see the rain pushing in. A spell of snow is also possible across higher ground in north Wales and the Staffordshire Moors, but it will struggle to stick. Temperatures will then turn mild, but not a presence. Across the bulk of Indian and Wales for Saturday. A lot of cloud, outbreaks of rain and chilly. It will also be chilly across Scotland, but at least dry. But watch for ice left over from the overnight showers. As we go on through Saturday, it will be a struggle to get much brightness across the bulk of England and Wales. Much brighter skies for much of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and eventually the far north of England, but again, a chilly day here. Chile on Saturday night, under clear skies. A widespread frost developing, particularly for Scotland, Northern Ireland and central and eastern parts of England and Wales. Even some of the larger towns and cities are seeing temperatures dropping below freezing. But for most of us, it is a dry day on Sunday. Chilly, but with latter wins, not feeling too bad out there. The wind will pick up across the far West later in the day. Temperatures begin to pick up again, meaning we are in for something more unsettled for the start of next week. Overall, a changeable spell of weather for the start of 2015. Our top story: Abandoned at three - another ship is left to drift with hundreds of refugees on board, off the coast of Italy. That’s all from us. Now we go to our news teams where you are. Good afternoon. Fares on the Underground are going up by average of 2.5% from today. The Mayor says this represents a freeze in real terms, but the rail unions say that since the coalition came to power fares have QOFIE up ‘f8SlâIâ ti’I8I’I BVEFBQE WBQES. Our political correspondent Karl Mercer reports. Anyone buying their tickets this morning would have had to dig deeper. Transport for London’s annual gift for passengers is a further rise. On average, fares will go further rise. On average, fares will 90 UP go up 2.5%. The service does not justify the increase. We have not seen an increase in trains. There is always overcrowding. I am not seeing where the extra money is going. It is frustrating, to be honest. I am keen for them to improve the rolling stock, improve the service and I don’t think they have long-term plans for improving the service. I think the increase is reasonable and has been over the last two to three years. I buy my ticket in advance so I make sure I get the cheapest fares I can. Transport for London says the increases are needed to help pay for improvements. But it has helped some part-time workers. From today, the daily limit on Oyster cards for zones one and two will be £6 40. And zones one to six will be a saving of £4, a move welcomed across the political divide and by campaigners. We are pleased the introduction of much lower rates for part-time workers on the pay-as-you-go cap but other workers will be affected in the increase of one day Travelcards. This rise is smaller than previous years and cynics might think a looming general election might have something to do with it but transformer -- might have something to do with it but transformer -- transport bosses say it will not be the end of rises.

Peter. Thank you. A man has died in Telford after taking drugs which may be linked to three previous deaths in Suffolk, according to police. Detectives think drugs containing a compound called PMMA may be responsible. The drugs are similar to ecstasy, but more dangerous. Suffolk Police are now conducting a major investigation in Ipswich, from where Ben Geoghegan sent this report. This is the pill known to some as Superman, which could be behind the death of three people in Ipswich since Christmas Eve. The police haven’t seen it before, it’s stronger and more dangerous. It’s described with 3 Superman logo on it. We believe there’s something in it, or it’s stronger, that has caused a real bad reaction with individuals and it’s sadly resulted in their death. At the moment, we’re currently forensically examining it to find out what that is. Yesterday, paramedics tried to save two men who lived on this estate, they’d both taken the drug. One man, in his 20s, died at the scene, the second is recovering in hospital. Two other young men died in separate incidents. Experts say the deaths could be linked to a dmg similar to ecstasy known as PMA. It can cause dehydration, an increased heart rate, high body temperature and seizures. Five years ago, there were no deaths from the drug in England and Wales, but in 2012 there were 20. A year later, there were 29. The thing about PMA is that it takes longer to have an effect than ecstasy. So people would take one and maybe think that it’s not working, and they’d been sold a dud, and take another one. The trouble then happens, because PMA is more toxic than ecstasy. The police here say that anyone who’s bought ecstasy recently and who hands it in won’t face prosecution. They say their priority is to get the drugs off the streets before anyone else dies. Ben Geoghegan, BBC News, Ipswich. It is — again — that time of year when railfares go up. From today, passengers face rises of 2.296. There may be some comfort in the fact that it’s the lowest annual increase in five years, but it does come after a Christmas period marked by widespread cancellations and delays. Here’s our transport correspondent, Richard Westcott. After the celebrations, the thrill of going back to work. From today, the commute’s more expensive too and it follows years of back—to—back fare rises. This is the 8.1Sam service between Cambridge and King’s Cross. It’s actually very quiet this morning. They’d normally be standing by now, obviously a lot of people going into work on Monday instead. A ticket on this service is £4,500, but it’s not just about the increase this year, it’s the increase every year. So the ticket is about £820 more expensive than it was just five years ago. There’s no other way of me getting into work. I couldn’t drive. It’s just unfeasible. So people have to, like myself, have to get the train. They know that. So they’ve pretty much got you over a barrel, haven’t they really? If I calculate the cost of actually travelling in by car, and I don’t own a car, because I can travel in by train, it’s not too much difference, actually. So, at the moment, I think I’m getting value—for—money. We’ve already made the decision to move closer to London, which has cut down my commuting time, but has also helped to reduce the fare. Successive governments have been cutting the amount they pay for the railways, which means passengers are having to pay a lot more. So the commute from Milton Keynes to London has gone up by £930 since 2010. A season ticket from Newcastle to Middlesborough is nearly £500 more expensive than it was five years. The Government’s criticised every time it puts prices up, so why keep doing it? Nobody likes to see ticket price increases, I wish they weren’t necessary. We are investing record amounts into our railway industry. Over the next four years, Network Rail will spend £385 billion investing in our railway. But campaigners say enough’s enough, and here’s why. Fares are increasing faster than wages. Ticket prices have risen by more than 20% in the last five years, but average wages have risen by less than 7% over the same period. But the reality is, fares are likely to keep going up for some years yet. Richard Westcott, BBC News, on the 8.1Sam from Cambridge. Let’s have a look at some of the other stories making the news today. A ferry which caught fire on Sunday has been towed into the Italian port of Brindisi. Investigators are now looking at the causes of the disaster which led to the deaths of 13 people. There are fears the final toll could be higher amid uncertainty over how many people were actually on board. Four passengers have suffered minor injuries after their aircraft was blown off the runway at Stornoway Airport in the Outer Hebrides. It’s thought the Loganair flight may have been caught in strong crosswinds as it tried to take off for Glasgow this morning. Debt charities have welcomed new rules on payday loans to protect people from unscrupulous lenders. From today, those unable to repay should be prevented from taking out loans. Rates will be capped, and borrowers will never have to repay more than twice the amount they borrow. Most types of cancer can be put down to bad luck, and not unhealthy living, according to new research. A study in the United States of more than 30 types of cancer found that most were caused by chance mutations that couldn’t be prevented. But around a third, including lung and skin cancer, do have links to lifestyle, as our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh explains. John Hartson lines up the shot... You can be fit and at the top of your game, like former Celtic striker John Hartson, but that’s no guarantee you won’t get cancer. Six years ago, aged just 3A, he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer, which had spread to his brain and loans. —— lungs. Now, after chemotherapy, he’s made a full recovery. It doesn’t matter if you’re the fittest man in the world, you know, it doesn’t stop you from being diagnosed with cancer, I feel. But what I also feel as well is that if you are unfortunate to be diagnosed, I think your fitness levels and the fact that I was an athlete for the best part of 17, 18 years, that certainly helped, in terms of my recovery. After analysing how cell mutations triggered cancer in different tissues in the body, American scientists found two thirds of cancer types were due to bad luck. These include bone, pancreatic and brain cancers, so efforts here need to be focused on early diagnosis, rather than prevention. But that still leaves one in three cancers where lifestyle or the genes you inherit play a key role. They include cancers of the skin, the lung - most rases are linked to smoking - and colon cancer, where poor diet increases the risks. We shouldn’t be throwing our new year’s resolutions out the window, no. We absolutely know that you can cut your risk of developing cancer by good choices like not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, having a healthy diet, and cutting back on alcohol. The single biggest risk factor for cancer is advancing age, and so out of our control, but this study, in the journal Science, does not undermine or contradict decades of research which show that a healthy lifestyle can help you avoid many cancers and other illnesses. Fergus Walsh, BBC News. Our top story this evening: The Italian coastguard come to the aid of 500 migrants abandoned by people smugglers in the Mediterranean. And still to come, the big bucks in Buckinghamshire, an ancient hoard of coins that could be worth millions.

It’s official, Liverpool captain and local hero Steven Gerrard is on his way out of the club. Gerrard, who’s SA, has spent his entire career with Liverpool, joining its youth scheme when he was just eight years old. He helped Liverpool win the FA Cup twice, in 2001 and 2006, as well as a Champions League tiﬂa in 2005. In all, he’s made nearly 700 appearances for the club. And he said today that the decision to leave at the end of the season was the toughest of his life. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss is at Anfield for us now. Andy. Yes, as you say, Steven Gerrard was still at primary school when he still at primary school when he joined the youth system here. Since joined the youth system here. Since then he has blossomed into one of then he has blossomed into one of English football’s most famous English football’s most famous players, but finally the club which players, but finally the club which has been his home for so many years has been his home for so many years is preparing for life without him. A brief hello before the long goodbye, Steven Gerrard arriving for training this morning but also to confirm the end of an era. Gerrard! 0h, Steven Gerrard! In the fickle world of football, Gerrard has been that rarity, a one—club man, Liverpool for life, captain and cornerstone. But this season at Anfield will be his last. In a statement, he said, this has been the toughest decision of my life, and one which both me and my family have agonised over for a great deal of time. Saying goodbye is going to be difficult, but I feel it’s something that’s in the best interests of all involved. At Anfield, though, where Gerrard has been such a towering presence, there was only sadness. Really gutted, but I feel it’s probably the right time for him to go, so long as he doesn’t do 3 Frank Lampard and go somewhere else in England. Steven Gerrard has played with some average players over the years, some good teams, like, but probably Liverpool’s best ever player. He’s a legend. I think he’d be in any Liverpool person’s greatest XI of all time. Gerrard’s bond with Liverpool had seemed unbreakable from joining as an eight—year—old to his first—team debut as a teenager to the heady heights of a Champions League triumph, the club’s hero and heartbeat. But at 34, he’s been starting fewer games. Still scoring, though — two yesterday, and his loyalty to Liverpool through some tough times has been applauded. He’s a local lad, he’s give the club blood, he ran through wars for them. He’s played with a lot of mediocrity, you know, over the last 20 years or so of his career at Liverpool. And the man who may now have to fill Gerrard’s boots knows it is the most daunting of challenges. It will be difficult, because he’s such a leader of our group, such a figurehead, really, and he has been for many years. So it will be a shock to everyone, especially as as players, and we’ve just got to try and deal with it as best we can, really. Gerrard will leave with one regret — he never won Premier League, but his status as a home club legend should be ample consolation. Soon to be gone, but surely never forgotten. So what now for Steven Gerrard? Well, he says he doesn’t want to Well, he says he doesn’t want to play for another Premier League play for another Premier League dub, play for another Premier League club, so we moved to America looks club, so we moved to America looks likely, where David Beckham blades likely, where David Beckham blades towards the end of his career. He towards the end of his career. He also says that one day he would like also says that one day he would like to return to Anfield in some other to return to Anfield in some other capacity, and certainly the fans capacity, and certainly the fans will be hoping that they haven’t will be hoping that they haven’t seen the last of them. Reeta. Many seen the last of them. Reeta. Many thanks, Andy. A total of 30 bodies have now been recovered from the AirAsia passengerjet that crashed on Sunday. Rescuers have been working in the Java Sea off Borneo, trying to pick up a signal from the plane’s black—box recorder. Our correspondent Rupert Wingfield—Hayes sent this report from Pangkalan Bun, where the search operation is based. Today was the day the bodies really started coming in. This US Navy helicopter is carrying four of the dead from AirAsia flight 8501. This afternoon, it landed three times at the airbase here, bringing 12 bodies in all. The crew of the US warship, the USS Sampson, had found them floating about 30 miles away from where other bodies were found on Thursday. Why they had drifted so far apart is still unclear. Out in the Java Sea, the weather is still the biggest problem for the search teams. It is now the middle of the rainy season in Indonesia, and thunderstorms come almost every day. A small armada of ships is now on station, including ones with sophisticated sonar and a special underwater microphone that can listen for the plane’s black boxes. They’re using two technologies, says this official, side—scanning sonar and a multi—beam echo These allow us to create a picture of the undersea environment to see wreckage and even bodies in the water. Tonight the bodies recovered today were placed in coffins and carried aboard a special plane for theirfinalﬂight back to their families in Surabaya. When they spotted the first wreckage out in the Java Sea on Tuesday, there was optimism here that the rest of the plane would be found within days. But not any more. While they are continuing to recover more and more bodies from the surface of the sea, and some small bits of wreckage too, the truth is they still have no idea where the main parts of the plane’s wreckage are lying, whether they are in one place or whether they are scattered over a wide area. Crucially, they have still received no signal at all from the plane’s black boxes. Rupert Wingfield—Hayes, BBC News, in Pangkalan Bun, Indonesia. The outgoing chief of the UN anti—Ebola mission has said the world can stamp out Ebola by the end of the year. Nearly 20,000 people have been infected with disease, and 8,000 people have died from it. The UN official said that the outbreak in West Africa could be brought under control but there was still a long and difficult way to go. Well, there may still be four months until the general election, but the campaign started in earnest today with the launch of the first poster by the Conservatives. It was unveiled in Yorkshire by David Cameron with the slogan, ""Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy"". The Prime Minister said Britain was facing its most critical election in a generation, as our political correspondent Chris Mason reports. These sun was belly up and the Conservatives were out and about Conservatives were out and about with their advertising ban. —— the with their advertising ban. -- the sun was belly with their advertising ban. —— the sun was belly up.

The coins, from the 10th and 11th centuries, were buried just two feet underground and could be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Robert Hall has the story.

GUNSHOT Death In Paradise returns... Buckingham Palace denies claims by a woman in the US that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was underage. The Prince is named in documents filed in a Florida court in a long-running legal case. We’ll be looking at the allegations and asking where this leaves the Prince. Also tonight.

The Mayor says it’s a freeze in real terms - unions disagree. And calls for more warnings to tourists abroad - about the dangers of buying fake bottles of alcohol. Good evening. Prince Andrew has been named in court documents in the United States by a woman who claims she was made to have sex with him while she was reported to have been 17 at the time. The woman, who has not been named, said she was forced to have sexual relations with the Prince on three separate occasions by a billionaire business associate of his. Buckingham Palace has issued a statement denying the allegations, as our royal correspondent Peter Hunt reports. IU is ironing? He did, because of his relationship with a sex offender. In 2011 Prince Andrew was forced to give up a job he loved, flying a flag is the special representative for Britain abroad. The Queen’s sun continues to pay a price for his failure ofjudgement. He has apologised for his friendship withjeffrey Epstein, He has apologised for his friendship with jeffrey Epstein, who withjeffrey Epstein, who is a registered sex offender. Andrew once stayed with him in New York. The well-connected billionaire was sentenced in 2008 to 18 months in jail after pleading guilty to an offence of soliciting a minor for prostitution. Now, as part of a long-running legal battle, Prince Andrew has been named in court papers in Florida. It’s not at action against him, rather an unnamed woman is alleging that other minor she was the victim of sex trafficking scheme run byjeffrey Epstein. The document reads, one such powerful individualjeffrey Epstein forced the woman to have relationships with Prince Andrew. It is alleged to have happened once here at all on his private island in the Caribbean, when the woman is reported to have been 17, and also in London and New York. In a statement, Buckingham Palace responded robustly. Saying, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue. Tonight, the American lawyer who is also accused in the Florida court document, has denied the allegation. She has lied about me. She has lied about other public figures including a former Prime Minister and others who she claims to have participated. In sexual activities with. It must be presumed that all of her allegations against Prince Andrew R. Prince Andrew now has to live with an allegation he has denied while he continues his work as a senior Royal. Peter is Buckingham Palace now. Where does leave Prince Andrew? It is striking Buckingham Palace said anything at all. In the past they might have observed a dignified silence but given the gravity of the allegation which is denied, they felt they had no choice but to say something. It places Prince Andrew in a difficult position. He is not a party to the court proceedings. From his perspective it is past-- it is unfortunate his past friendship has reared head again, when he is reinventing himself as focusing on apprentice ships and passionate about technology. Those around the Prince say this denial of wrongdoing is total, absolute and emphatic. A cargo ship carrying around 500 migrants who were abandoned by their crew in the Mediterranean is due to arrive in port in southern Italy tonight - after being towed by the coastguard. Most of the migrants are thought to be Syrian, and include children and pI’âgI’I8I’Il WOITIEFI. It’s the second time in a week that hundreds of people have been rescued, after being deserted by the people-smugglers running the ships. Our correspondent james Reynolds is portside. The PBSSEFIQEFS BFE The passengers are about to end theirjourney. There is plenty of activity in the harbour. We can see the ship beginning to arrive here. Soon, the passengers will be in the port and finally they will be on dry land. These grainy night-time shots show Italy’s rescue of the drifting ship. Smugglers apparently abandoned it deliberately, leaving the migrants packed on board to be rescued by Coastguard, airlifted onto the deck. It is a new traffickers’ tactic and it appears to have worked. A vessel from Iceland, part of a new EU border force, toad the ship towards safety. This is the third time a Coast Guard has managed such a situation. It is a risky operation for the personnel. We have a ship which is adrift, with no command. On Tuesday, its coastguards scrambled to rescue another boat. Its crew abandoned ship and left it heading straight for the shore. 700 migrants escaping war in the Middle East were packed into the boat’s hole. One woman is reported to have given birth after the ship was rescued. Tonight, this Italian harbour is ready for the arrival of its rescued migrants. This is their welcome to Europe. A collection of vans in the dark. This is what awaits the exhausted passengers. As they will take their first steps on European soil, those who can walk will get to come to these tents, where there are volunteers working. If anyone is hungry, there is bags and bags of cheese sandwiches waiting for them. The desperate voyage from the Middle East to Europe is the world’s most dangerous migrantjourney. For the dangerous migrant journey. For the passengers dangerous migrantjourney. For the passengers of the ship, the risk appears to have paid off. They have made it to Europe. Very soon those passengers will be here in the dock. The weakest will go to hospital and others will get into police convoys and there will be organised beds for them in town. They may simply be too exhausted to celebrate getting here. They may have to talk to the police, who will want to find out the full story of what happened on that boat. Most migrants who make the dangerous journey across the sea to Europe come from war zones in the Middle East and Africa. A senior United Nations official said today’s events were part of a worrying situation that could no longer be ignored by European governments. Our correspondent Chris Morris looks behind the story at Europe’s I’âSpOI’ISâ. Desperate people take desperate measures to get to Europe any way they can. This is the land border between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla. More than 150 people made it across this week. But you can’t fence off everything, not when the main illegal route into southern Europe is by sea. A total of 60,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean in 2013. Last year, that number rose above 200,000. About 80% of them arrive in Italy, that’s a rate of more than A80 people every day of the year. What needs to be done is to find safe, legal ways for refugees to come to Europe either through resettlement programmes, through humanitarian admission programmes, through family reunification, or other ways, so they don’t need to risk their lives in this way. Here in Brussels the European Commission said today that the fight against people smuggling will continue to be a priority in 2015 and it will have to be. People have been trying to reach Europe from far afield for years, looking for safety, security, or often simply the chance of a better life. But the pace of illegal migration has increased dramatically and the EU is struggling to cope. Hundreds of migrants drowned when ships sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2013. In response, Italy launched a big naval operation to patrol the seas. But it’s been scaled back after other countries failed to help fund it. And a smaller multinational operation, Triton, run by the EU’s border agency, has taken over. That’s emboldening the traffickers, making them see they can do more of what they want in the Mediterranean without being picked up on it by the big member states. What we need is the big member states properly burden sharing in the Mediterranean. Britain supports Triton, but argues that too many maritime patrols simply encourages more migrants to set sail. As long as conditions in their countries of origin are so dire though, many will risk these dangerous journeys come what may. America has announced a series of further sanctions against North Korea following the cyber attack on Sony Pictures last month for which the government in Pyongyang was blamed by the White House. We can talk now to our North America Editorjon Sopel, who’s in Washington for us. There are lots of people who doubt that North Korea was in fact behind the attack, but this is nonetheless fierce retaliation by Washington? Yes, cyber security experts have said it was not North Korea, it was a disgruntled ex-employee who was responsible for the attack and North Korea denied responsibility. But the US administration still hold North Korea responsible. Today, they announced ten individuals would be targeted, as well as three organisations. The intelligence agency and two defence companies. I think what the Americans are also saying is they are not sure these are the people responsible for the attack anyway. Two things to note. They say this is the first aspect of the US’s response, in other words there will be more sanctions. It implies it is a denial that America was responsible for an Internet outage a little earlier on over the Christmas holidays. One thing we can say with certainty, there will be a full throated response from Pyongyang. Rail passengers face rises of 2.2% in ticket prices from today. This year’s rise is the lowest annual increase in five years, but it comes after a Christmas period marked by widespread cancellations and delays. Ticket prices have risen by over 20% since 2010. Average wages have risen byjust 6.9% over the same period. The Transport Secretary said that while any increase was ""regrettable"", ""record amounts"" were being invested in the railways. A man has died in Telford after taking drugs which may be linked to three previous deaths in Suffolk, according to police. Detectives think drugs containing a compound called PMMA may be responsible. The drugs are similar to ecstasy, but more dangerous. Suffolk Police are now conducting a major investigation in Ipswich, from where Ben Geoghegan sent this report. This is the pill known to some as Superman, which could be behind the death of three people in Ipswich since Christmas Eve. The police haven’t seen it before, it’s stronger and more dangerous. It’s described with a Superman logo on it. We believe there’s something in it, or it’s stronger, that has caused a real bad reaction with individuals and it’s sadly resulted in their death. At the moment, we’re currently forensically examining it to find out what that is. Yesterday, paramedics tried to save two men who lived on this estate, they’d both taken the drug. One man, in his 20s, died at the scene, the second is recovering in hospital. Two other young men died in separate incidents. Experts say the deaths could be linked to a drug similar to ecstasy known as PMA. It can cause dehydration, an increased heart rate, high body temperature and seizures. Five years ago, there were no deaths from the drug in England and Wales, but in 2012 there were 20. A year later, there were 29. The thing about PMA is that it takes longer to have an effect than ecstasy. So people would take one and maybe think that it’s not working, and they’d been sold a dud, and take another one. The trouble then happens, because PMA is more toxic than ecstasy. The police here say that anyone who’s bought ecstasy recently and who hands it in won’t face prosecution. They say their priority is to get the drugs off the streets before anyone else dies. Ben Geoghegan, BBC News, Ipswich. Four passengers have suffered minor injuries after their aircraft was blown off the runway at Stornoway Airport in the Outer Hebrides. It’s thought the Loganair flight may have been caught in strong crosswinds as it tried to take-off for Glasgow this morning. It’s still four months until the general election, but the campaign started in earnest today with the launch of the first poster by the Conservatives. It was unveiled in Yorkshire, by David Cameron, with the slogan: ""Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy."" The Prime Minister said Britain was facing its most critical election in a generation, as our political correspondent, Chris Mason, reports. The sun was barely up and the Conservatives were out and about with their advertising van. ""Let’s stay on the road to a stronger economy"", read the slogan. And it was a road the Prime Minister was determined to stay on, on a visit to Halifax. When you are on the road to eliminating the deficit, don’t turn back. When you’re on the road to greater security for our country, don’t turn back. I’m not saying we’ve solved all the country’s problems in the last five years, but we’ve created those jobs, we’ve turned our economy around and we’ve cut our deficit in half. But has the deficit been cut in half? When the Coalition came to power, the Government was spending £153 billion a year more than it brought in in tax. This year that figure is expected to be £91 billion, a fall of a third. But, with the economy growing, the deficit, as a proportion of national income, is falling more quickly, from just over 10%, five years ago, to 5% now, or half. The Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, was campaigning in a marginal seat near Leeds today. He claims the Conservatives’ plans are increasingly extreme. Living standards have been squeezed for working people, tax cuts only for the richest, and now even deeper cuts in public services, in our police, in our schools, in our hospitals maybe too, that is not the direction Britain needs to go in, and that is why Labour is setting out a clear alternative. So with four months and five days to go, expect plenty more days like this, with poster launches and newspaper articles attempting to twist our arms. The Liberal Democrats and Ukip will have plenty to say too, as will others, and a lot of it will be on this central battle ground of the economy. David Cameron won’t always get this kind of reception. The road to the election for all parties will have more than a few bumps. Chris Mason, BBC News. China says it is facing a growing threat from militant Islam. It’s in the midst of a year-long crackdown focused on the western province of Xinjiang, home to the Uighur minority, who are predominantly Muslim. The police budget there has been doubled and hundreds of Uighurs jailed, but violence has continued. Reporting from Xingjiang is extremely difficult, but our China editor, Carrie Gracie, travelled to the region and sent this report. Closer to Baghdad than to Beijing. Xinjiang is home to 10 million Uighurs. In language, culture and religion they’re different, and China doesn’t trust them. Every crowd has its informers, hunting down traitors. You walk through this night food market you’d think it’s a normal, relaxed society, but Uighurs cannot express a political grievance, a religious grievance or criticise the government without risking many years injail. So I can talk to them about the food that they’re eating, or the hats they’re wearing, but I cannot ask them about anything else because it’s simply too dangerous. The surveillance state. Beijing says terrorists must be chased down, like rats in the street, and the police budget has doubled. Counter-terrorism trumps civil liberties. The moment Beijing’s patience snapped. Tiananmen Square, October 2013. The attackers came 2,000 miles to strike at the heart of the nation, killing and maiming innocent tourists, before setting their vehicle on fire. They filmed themselves before the attack. Brainwashed, says Beijing, byjihadi videos from abroad. But is that the whole story of their radicalisation? I heard reports the government had destroyed part of their mosque and they had vowed revenge. I’m trying to get to their village and talk to those who knew them. Our car was turned back by police. Our second attempt, on a public bus. Beijing fears religion breeds terror. For anyone under 50, beards are not allowed. Veils, discouraged. He confirms that government officials are not allowed to pray in mosques. At police check-points, young Uighur men are targeted. Now, it’s their mobile phones that are suspect. They have to check the phone cards to see that they don’t have any illegal materials on it. Apparently, almost anything of a religion nature is now unacceptable to have on your phone. No shooting. So the village where the Tiananmen attacker came from is just on the other side of that police cordon, a couple of miles. We’ve come a couple of thousands of miles and we’re stuck here now because they’ve taken our passports from us, because they made it quite clear that we’re not going to get there. The state fears Uighurs and Uighurs fear the state. Walls have ears and no-one dares speak up. When Beijing makes no distinction between those who voice a grievance and those who resort to terror. Punishing the many for the violence of the few risks a war of attrition with China’s Uighurs. Carry Gracie, BBC News, Xinjiang. Liverpool captain and local hero, Steven Gerrard, is leaving the club. Gerrard, who’s 34, has spent his entire career with Liverpool, joining its youth scheme when he wasjust eight-years-old. He said his decision to leave, at the end of the season, was the ""toughest of his life."" Here’s our sports correspondent, Andy Swiss. A brief hello before the long goodbye, Steven Gerrard arriving for training this morning, but also to confirm the end of an era. Gerrard! It’s gone in. Oh, Steven Gerrard! In the fickle world of football, Gerrard had been that rarity, a one-club man, Liverpool for life, captain and cornerstone. But this season at Anfield will be his last. In a statement, he said: ""This has been the toughest decision of my life, and one which both me and my family have agonised over for a great deal of time. Saying goodbye is going to be difficult, but I feel it’s something that’s in the best interests of all involved."" At Anfield, though, where Gerrard has been such a towering presence, there was only sadness. Really gutted, but I feel it’s probably the right time for him to go, so long as he doesn’t do a Frank Lampard and go somewhere else in England. Steven Gerrard has played with some average players over the years, some good teams, like, but probably Liverpool’s best ever player. He’s a legend. I think he’d be in any Liverpool person’s Greatest XI of all time. Gerrard’s bond with Liverpool had seemed unbreakable, from joining as an eight-year-old, to his first-team debut as a teenager, to the heady heights of a Champions League triumph, the club’s hero and heartbeat. But at 34, he’s been starting fewer games. Still scoring, though - two more yesterday, and his loyalty to Liverpool through some tough times has been applauded. He’s a local lad. He’s give the club blood. You know, he’s ran through wars for them. He’s played with a lot of mediocrity, you know, over the last 20 years or so of his career at Liverpool. And the man who may now have to fill Gerrard’s boots knows it is the most daunting of challenges. It’ll be difficult, because he’s such a leader of our group, such a figurehead, really, and he has been for many years. So it’ll be a shock to everyone, especially us as players, and we’ve just got to try and deal with it as best we can, really. So where does Gerrard go from here? Well, he says it won’t be any other Premier League club. Instead, America seems the most likely option, but he says he does one day want to return here, in his words, ""to serve Liverpool again."" So a future manager, perhaps? Well, whatever happens, his status as a playing legend is assured. Soon to be gone from Liverpool, but never forgotten. Andy Swiss, BBC News, Anfield. It’s one of the largest hoards of Anglo-Saxon coins ever found in Britain and it was discovered by a man with a metal detector on a farm near Aylesbury. The coins, from the 10th and 11th centuries, were buried just two feet underground and could be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Robert Hall has the story. Under the pastures of Buckinghamshire, lost for nine centuries, a metal detectorist’s dream. This is the moment when the Weekend Wanderers Club crowded to see the find and member, Paul Coleman, realised he’d stumbled across something extraordinary. I saw one shiny disc. Because it was quite dark down that far down, but it was reflected in the sky and I immediately knew it was a coin. You just know. So I bent down to pick the coin up and, as I could then focus down in the hole, I could see lots of other circular shapes behind it. Look at the condition of the ones in the centre. As Paul filmed the excavation, it became clear that this was more than a handful of coins. There were layers of them, mostly in pristine condition, wrapped in a lead container. First tens, then hundreds, then thousands. Staff from the County Museum in Aylesbury already care for a small Celtic hoard. This treasure has surfaced just a few miles from the first. The coins are from the late Anglo-Saxon period. The two kings that have been identified so far are Ethelred II, that’s Ethelred the Unready, and Canute. So they date to probablyjust after 1000 AD up to about 1050. Again, until the coins have been cleaned, and we know the date of the latest coins, we can’t be sure. Restoration is being carried out at the British Museum. This is the result so far. A coroner will now rule on whether Paul Coleman’s discovery is treasure. The coins are thought to be worth over £1 million and any proceeds, possibly from sale to a museum, would be split between finder and landowner. So how did they end up here? Were they hidden from Viking invaders? Did they come from the Royal Mint at Buckingham, just up the road? Or were they simply buried for safekeeping within a Saxon settlement? There are so many questions yet to be answered. This find marks the start of a story which has a long way to run. Robert Hall, BBC News at Padbury, in Buckinghamshire. That’s all from us. Now, on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Victoria Hollins. Fares on the Underground are going up by an average of 2.5% from today. The Mayor says this represents a freeze in real terms, but the rail unions say that since the coalition came to power fares have QOFIE up f8SlâIâ li’I8I’I BVEFBQE WBQES. Our political correspondent Karl Mercer reports. Anyone buying tickets this morning would have had to dig just a little bit deeper. Transport for London’s annual New Year gift to passengers is a fare rise and this year is no different. On average fares will go up 2.5%. The service doesn’tjustify the increase. We haven’t seen an increase in trains. There’s always overcrowding. So I’m not really seeing where the extra money is going. So it’s quite frustrating to be honest. I’m keen for them to improve the rolling stock, to improve the service and I don’t think they have good long-term plans for improving the service. I think the increase is quite reasonable and has been for the last two or three years. I buy my tickets in advance when I go to work so I make sure I get the cheapest fares I can. Transport for London says the increases are needed to help pay for improvements to bus and Tube services. But it has offered some help to part-time workers. From today, the daily cap on pay-as-you-go Oyster card for zones one and two will be £6.40, a saving of £2. And for zones 1-6 it will now be £11.70, a saving of more than £4. That’s a move welcomed across the political divide and also by campaigners. This year, we are pleased that the introduction of much lower rates for part-time workers on the pay-as-you-go cap, but of course other part-time workers will be affected by the increase in the cost of the one-day off-peak travel card. This year’s rise is smaller than previous years. Cynics might think a looming general election has something to do with it but transport bosses say this won’t be the end of fare rises. No one likes to put fares up. But there’s a massive investment needed in London, which is why the fares need to go up, we need to provide for the investment. ",,

First tens, then hundreds, then thousands. Staff from the County Museum in Aylesbury already care for a small Celtic hoard. This treasure has surfaced just a few miles from the first. The coins are from the late Anglo-Saxon period. The two kings that have been identified so far are Ethelred II, that’s Ethelred the Unready, and Canute. So they date to probablyjust after 1000 AD up to about 1050. Again, until the coins have been cleaned, and we know the date of the latest coins, we can’t be sure. Restoration is being carried out at the British Museum. This is the result so far. A coroner will now rule on whether Paul Coleman’s discovery is treasure. The coins are thought to be worth over £1 million and any proceeds, possibly from sale to a museum, would be split between finder and landowner. So how did they end up here? Were they hidden from Viking invaders? Did they come from the Royal Mint at Buckingham, just up the road? Or were they simply buried for safekeeping within a Saxon settlement? There are so many questions yet to be answered. This find marks the start of a story which has a long way to run. Robert Hall, BBC News at Padbury, in Buckinghamshire. That’s all from us. Now, on BBC one, it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Victoria Hollins. Fares on the Underground are going up by an average of 2.5% from today. The Mayor says this represents a freeze in real terms, but the rail unions say that since the coalition came to power fares have QOFIE up ‘f8SlâIâ li’I8I’I BVETBQE WBQES. Our political correspondent Karl Mercer reports. Anyone buying tickets this morning would have had to dig just a little bit deeper. Transport for London’s annual New Year gift to passengers is a fare rise and this year is no different. On average fares will go up 2.5%. The service doesn’tjustify the increase. We haven’t seen an increase in trains. There’s always overcrowding. So I’m not really seeing where the extra money is going. So it’s quite frustrating to be honest. I’m keen for them to improve the rolling stock, to improve the service and I don’t think they have good long-term plans for improving the service. I think the increase is quite reasonable and has been for the last two or three years. I buy my tickets in advance when I go to work so I make sure I get the cheapest fares I can. Transport for London says the increases are needed to help pay for improvements to bus and Tube services. But it has offered some help to part-time workers. From today, the daily cap on pay-as-you-go oyster card for zones one and two will be £6.lIo, a saving of £2. And for zones 1-6 it will now be £11.70, a saving of more than ile. That’s a move welcomed across the political divide and also by campaigners. This year, we are pleased that the introduction of much lower rates for part-time workers on the pay-as-you-go cap, but of course other part-time workers will be affected by the increase in the cost of the one-day off-peak travel card. This year’s rise is smaller than previous years. Cynics might think a looming general election has something to do with it but transport bosses say this won’t be the end of fare rises. No one likes to put fares up. But there’s a massive investment needed in London, which is why the fares need to go up, we need to provide for the investment. The big return to work is on Monday when hundreds of thousands more Londoners will find themselves paying a bit more for their commute. People who use the Central Line into Tottenham Court Road Station are set to have theirjourneys disrupted for almost a year as the line won’t stop there. The work is intended to improve access to Central Line platforms, with new entrances and lift access from the ticket hall and to the Northern Line. Transport for London has advised people to change at oxford Circus or Holborn for alternative routes. It’s about ensuring the station has got capacity for Crossrail when it comes along in a few years time. We think that the use of station will grow from about 150,000 people to about 200,000 people a day. A man has been charged over the murder of a lI3-year-old in Whitechapel. john Keenan was found dead in the early hours of New Year’s Day in Sidney Street. 3lI-year-old Terry Hamer will appear at Thames Magistrates Court tomorrow. A man has died at a block of flats in south-east London which was evacuated because of a chemical scare. He was one of two who suffered from an electric shock in the incident. Around 100 residents at the block in New Cross were moved from their homes overnight as a precaution. The number of rapes reported in London’s hospitals has doubled in the past three years, according to figures from the Metropolitan Police. The force has also recorded a significant increase in the number of patients reporting sexual assaults - from 72 to 124. London accounts for one fifth of all reported attacks in hospitals across the country. People tell us that they often do not get believed, their crimes don’t get treated seriously, so there’s a real culture change that needs to happen, and a greater awareness of people on the front line, police but also people in health settings, to understand that these sort of crimes are happening. Family and friends of a backpacker who died after drinking poison say authorities need to do more to warn tourists about the dangers of buying fake bottles of alcohol. Cheznye Emmons from Essex was on holiday in Indonesia when she drank methanol that had been sold as gin. Her family wants to help other travellers spot fake spirits sold abroad. Felicity Simper reports. Cheznye Emmons went backpacking in April 2013. She bought what she thought was normal gin, but it was spiked with methanol. Within days, she died. She had wires hanging out of her, and she was on a life-support machine. It was horrific. Absolutely horrific. Her family started a campaign to get fake alcohol off the streets. This is the moment Cheznye’s father confronted shopkeepers in Indonesia. When they spot the camera, they refuse to serve him. Now their campaign is closer to home. With the help of a close friend, they’re trying to raise £20,000 to put posters in every doctor’s surgery in the country. 18,000 people a year die from methanol poisoning in Indonesia. We want people to be aware of this so when they go out there, they don’t drink bottles. It doesn’t matter how legitimate they look, they are more than likely going to be counterfeit alcohol. Most of those poisoned are local. The Association of British Travel Agents says incidents of methanol poisoning affecting UK nationals in Indonesia have been mercifully rare. The Foreign office advice is to take extreme care when purchasing spirit-based drinks as bottles may appear to be genuine when they’re not. What the family have been through is just horrific. We want to make sure it doesn’t happen to someone else. It is a matter of time before it happens to someone else. It happened recently to two German brothers. They both died of methanol poisoning. It will happen again, so we’re doing our utmost to make sure people are aware of that and hopefully it doesn’t happen again. 20,000 posters have been printed. Once the funds are raised to distribute them, it is hoped those visiting the doctors to get innoculations before travelling will heed this warning. Felicity Simper reporting there.

Labour launches its election campaign calling it a once-in-a-generation fight. Ed Miliband said his party offered hope not falsehoods and said the Conservatives had created a nation of foodbanks and bank bonuses. It’s a choice between the Tory plan, or a Labour plan, that puts working people first, deals with the deficit and protects the NHS. But the Conservatives say their economic plan is working and voters must decide between competence and chaos. The British people have a clear choice, continue with a competent Conservative team, who have a long-term plan, or choose the chaos. We’ll be speaking to Norman Smith about the start of the 2015 campaign. Also this lunchtime - still in a critical condition - the charity Save The Children investigates how a Scottish nurse contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone. More than 1,000 jaguars and Land Rovers are on board the cargo ship that ran aground off the Isle of Wight on Saturday.

And, why this memorial to those who died in the Battle of Britain is being forced to close. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, says the 2015 general election will be a once-in-a-generation fight about who the country works for. He was speaking at the launch of Labour’s campaign, in which he condemned the Conservatives for creating a nation of foodbanks and bank bonuses. But the Tories have accused Labour of making billions of pounds worth of unfunded pledges and they say in May voters will choose between competence and chaos. Here’s our political correspondent, Ben Wright. Looking for questions while voters look for answers. Looking for questions while voters look foranswers. Launching look for answers. Launching Labour’s campaign in Salford, Ed Miliband said the sound and fury of the election presented a stark choice. This is nothing less than a once-in a-generation fight who the country vote for. Or a Labour plan that puts working people first and deals with the deficit and protects our NHS. Ed Miliband said if the Conservatives win again the NHS, as we know it, won’t be there. The BBC asked if that claim was fair. REPORTER: Aren’t you scaremongering over the NHS? REPORTER: Aren’t you scaremongering overthe NHS? Ithink REPORTER: Aren’t you scaremongering over the NHS? I think you should talk to people in the NHS Norman, because they will genuinely say to you, with an edge in their voice, where are things going to be in five years’ where are things going to be in five years’ tiex? What kind of NHS are we going to have? But for the Conservatives, the economy will drive their message and at a competing event this morning, the Tories tried to clobber Labour’s credibility, claiming the party had made £20 billion of uncosted spending commitments. The British people have a clear choice at the next election. Continue on the road to a stronger economy, with a competent Conservative team to have a long-term plan, or choose the chaos of over £20 billion of unfunded spending promises, higher taxes and more borrowing offered by the alternatives. Labour said the Conservatives were completely false in their sums, but all the parties’ spending plans are thin. None of the three main UK parties have set out anything like full details of how they will complete the fiscal repair job needed in the UK. Some have announced some giveaways. There are possible to have some, as long as they’re paid for by even bigger takeaways, but we don’t have the final figures. takeaways, but we don’t have the finalfigures. On March takeaways, but we don’t have the final figures. On March 18th the Chancellor will present the last Budget and on 30th March Parliament is dissolved and on 7th May the country votes. A strong coalition Government with Liberal Democrats anchoring it in the centre ground are not lurching to the extremes of left or right, remains the best way to make sure we finish the job and finish it fairly. The coming election is wide open. Perhaps the closest for decades and the politicians vying for your vote also insist it’s the most important. The story of the next Parliament will still be the deficit. And as the parties start to sketch out their plans, ask the questions, what spending will be cut, what taxes might have to rise, who do you trust? Let’s speak to our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith, who’s in Salford. More than four months to go, but the starting gun has been well and truly fired. It’s going to be an extraordinary election. Not merely for the lnth of time it’s going to take. Four months and my advice to viaers who don’t like -- and my advice to viaers who don’t like -- viewers who don’t like politics, maybe think of the sabbatical in Siberia. The outcome is more uncertain for any election in a generation, with the breakdown of traditional party loyalties and the rise of smaller parties like UKIP and the Greens and the SNP and extraordinary too because we learn today that despite that political uncertainty, political volatility, both the main parties seem intent on fighting very traditional meat and two veg campaigns, so Labour on the Health Service and the Tories on the economy. Ed Miliband warning this morning that a future Tory Government would shred the NHS, in his words and the Tories producing this 80-page dossier listing £20 billion worth of unfunded Labour spending commitments. Both the main parties also seeking to present this election as a sort of straightforward two-party choice between the Labour-only Government and Tory-only Government and yet that’s probably the one outcome we will not get, because all the signs are we are heading remorselessly towards another hung Parliament and another coalition Government. Norman, Smith. The charity, Save The Children, says it is determined to find out how a Scottish nurse, working at a treatment centre it runs in Sierra Leone, became infected with Ebola. Pauline Cafferkey is still critically ill in hospital in London. The investigation will concentrate on the protective equipment used by health workers. Richard Lister is outside the hospital in London. Sophie, Pauline Cafferkey remains in a critical condition on the top floor here. just last Wednesday, doctors are saying she was in good spirits and sitting up and talking to family and reading, but then her condition deteriorated somewhat sharply. It’s important to read not too much into that of course. You’ll remember the case of the Spanish nurse and the WHO doctor both of whom contracted Ebola and both of whom who were critically ill for at least a week before they made a full recovery, so the hope is the same will be true of Pauline Cafferkey, that she will get through this. The problem is, there’s no treatment for Ebola. The guarantee - problem is, there’s no treatment for Ebola. The guarantee - she has been treated with an experimental drug and plasma from European patients who have survived the disease, but it could be some days whether the doctors know if it’s having any impact, so for the moment she remains under very close observations and in high isolation here at the Royal Free. The hospital says they’ve also had concerns raised by members of the public about whether it is safe to come to this hospital. Given the fact that they have a very infectious patient here. They are saying, yes, it’s entirely safe and they’re open for business as usual, even as the treatment of Pauline Cafferkey continues. Well, Pauline Cafferkey’s case has prompted questions over whether British health care workers will continue to volunteer to work in areas affected by Ebola. Our global health correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, has been speaking to the director of the charity, Save The Children, in Sierra Leone, where Pauline Cafferkey is thought to have contracted the disease. We are at the iT tal lan-run British NGO holding facility and this is where Pauline Cafferkey was working when she first arrived in Sierra Leone. joining me is Luca and he heads up the facility here. You worked briefly with Pauline. Tell me a little about her. We move together. We flew together from England to Sierra Leone with the other part of the NHS staff and we started to work here and I introduce her to the staff working here and they were doing the training, the practical training before going inside the red area where we have the patients with other international staff. What are the key risks that health workers are taking when they’re in the facilities, because it’s not without risk? It’s not without risk. We are trying, as medical staff, to increase all procedures and protocol to reduce to a minimum, but of course to treat Ebola patients and to live in a community affected by Ebola is a scaryjob. The country directorfor Ebola is a scaryjob. The country director for Save The Children says some are concerned, but remain positive. We ensure that people can continue the support with this vital work. Staff morale is high, but people are concerned and we address the concerns by giving support both here and on the return. International medics play a vital role in dealing with this outbreak. This job role in dealing with this outbreak. Thisjob isn’t This job isn’t without risk, but the hope is that people will still commit to coming out here and helping those desperately in need in the hoeding and treament centres. -- holding and treatment centres. jaguar Land Rover has said that more than 1,000 of its cars are on board the cargo ship which has been stuck on a sandbank in the Solent since Saturday. The Norwegian vessel was deliberately grounded after it began to list shortly after leaving Southampton. Duncan Kennedy is there in the Solent now. You join us on what is still a relatively calm Solent. A couple of hundred metres from the ship there, you can see it’s tilted over at a 52 degree angle and calm weather is what the salvagers are looking for. We understand that one or two experts managed to get on board to take a look inside at exactly what is happening to the cars you just made reference to, but also to the 500 tonnes of fuel oil that is on board and also the water ballast tanks. All that information will be fed into their calculations before any salvage operation can begin and it will be an extremely complicated operation. A great hulking presence of the Hoegh Osaka is still on the sandbank, but it’s been unable to escape from it for two years. -- sandbank, but it’s been unable to escape from it for two years. -- two days. It’s listing at 52 degrees. Not enough to topple it, but still leaving it dangerously balanced next to this, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. We now know it was deliberately run aground here on Saturday night by the master of the ship and the pilot guiding him. They took the decision, after the vessel started tilting over. It was carrying 1400 cars and one focus was looking at whether the vehicles shifted during the short voyage out of Southampton docks. It’s hard to speculate at this stage and the truth will out, but it could be the vehicles were distributed in an unusual way or they shifted as the boat came out of the water and it could well be that the imbalance in the fuel tanks caused the ship to list, but until they get on board and assess the situation it’s speculation. This was the route the Hoegh Osaka was meant to take as it left Southampton, but instead in what would have been an extremely quick decision, it was decided to beach her on Bramble Bank, rather than risk going further. That means it hasn’t blocked shipping lanes and is not far out in rough, open seas. The salvage company is in charge of getting her upright and it has many days of work ahead. Believe it or not, right now here in the Solent it’s high tide and you can still see the ship is on the bank that you saw in the piece there, so the tide really isn’t doing the salvage operations much help. They want higher waters to get the kit in to pull that ship upright. We understand that the experts who were on board this morning are now off and there’s just one more problem on the horizon for them and it’s the weather here. It’s going to get worse as the week goes on. Cheltenham and Gloucester hospitals have declared major incidents due to high demand in A&E departments. A major incident allows the hospitals to call in extra staff. Several NHS trusts have taken the same action this winter. People have been asked to consider options other than A&E, such as calling the NHS 111 helpline. Prince Andrew has returned from a skiing holiday in Switzerland after being named in a court case involving a convicted sex offender. Yesterday, Buckingham Palace issued a second denial that the Duke of York had sexual contact with a woman who claims she was forced to have sex with him when she was 17, which is illegal in the American state where the court papers have been filed. Our royal correspondent, Peter Hunt, is with me. Two denials now? Not one, but two. The usual response from Buckingham Palace would be to say nothing and to hide behind the walls, but given the gravity and the fact it’s been widely circulated around the world, they felt they had no choice. The second statement was driven by Prince Andrew himself, who was skiing at the time in Switzerland and I think he was motivated by the desire to make clear to people that he wasn’t guilty and they were, as the statement said false and without foundation, but having said that, they are now very keen to get behind the ramparts once again and say not a lot. Prince Andrew now back from his holiday. What happens now? There’s a tried and tested Royal reaction when they face controversy and they’ve had plenty of that, which is to insist that the unfortunate individual in the spotlight is carrying on with their work. He’ll be trying to work out what more could he do and is there anything that he can do as he talks to the Queen and his lawyers and the advisers. He has no control over the drip, drip of the allegations. He’s described by those who know him is resilient and he’ll need that in the coming days. Labour launches its election campaign, calling it a once in a generation fight. But the Conservatives accuse labour of pledging more than £20 billion in unfunded spending commitments. And still to come, the latest on the search for the AirAsia plane that crashed into the java Sea with the loss of more than 160 passengers and crew. Later, I will have all the sport on BBC News as Sir Bradley Wiggins commits to Team Sky for another year before turning his attention to the track at the Rio Olympics in 2016. From today, newborn babies in England are to be tested for more genetic diseases. Up until now, babies were given a heel-prick blood test to look for five conditions, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. Now the test will include four other inherited diseases so that treatment can begin as early as possible. Here’s our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh. Pick it up, yeah! Poppy looks healthy but she has a rare and potentially fatal inherited disorder known as maple syrup urine disease which can lead to a harmful build-up of toxins in the blood. It was only picked up when she was nine months old, by which time it had caused some brain damage. Why should she have had to go through all this pain and hurt and actually have some serious damage done to her brain when, if it had been screened at birth, we wouldn’t have got to this point? Eleanor Masters’ daughter Snow is about to have her heel-prick blood test at London’s St Thomas’ Hospital. just a couple of drops of blood is all it takes to check for Poppy’s condition and eight other genetic disorders. Ijust find it really reassuring, it is great that things that can be really quite damaging can be detected early and acted upon as quickly as possible through this test. Screening already identifies 1500 newborns a year with genetic disorders. The extra test will be offered in England and in Wales from next week but no decision has been made yet in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Only around 30 babies a year are likely to benefit from the expansion of the newborn screening programme but for them, an early diagnosis will have profound advantages, enabling prompt treatment and so reducing the risk of severe disability and even death. And it will take the guesswork out of diagnosing diseases that ITIOSt dOCtoIâS I’IâVâI’ COITIE BCFOSS. Some of the symptoms are relatively common, sleeplessness and vomiting and breathlessness but these are common symptoms that might be missed. The problem is that the toxins inside the baby’s body can build up and this can cause permanent damage, permanent mental disability and it can even lead to coma and death. It may be years before Poppy’s parents know the extent of the damage to her brain. The new tests should mean other families will be spared their experience. Oldham Athletic is expected to announce whether it will sign the convicted rapist Ched Evans. One of the club’s main sponsors has said it will be ""out of the door"" if the club goes ahead with the signing. Let’s speak to our sports correspondent, Katie Gornall, who’s outside Boundary Park in Oldham. What is the decision expected to be? The longer this goes on, it is increasingly unlikely that the club will pursue the controversial plan to offer him a short-term contract. We are expecting a statement shortly. If they do say that, it would represent a dramatic U-turn from the club who, until this morning, looked set to announce him on a new contract. It appears that, in the face of growing public pressure and also from sponsors, that they are reconsidering the initial decision. We heard from a sponsor earlier who said that they would end their association with the club if they pursued this plan to sign Ched Evans. And we have heard from the local MP Deborah Abrahams who says it sends the wrong message to fans for the club to consider signing a convicted rapist. A petition set up yesterday now has 25,000 signatures, all calling for the chairman of the club to reconsider and it appears the board are listening and have reconsidered but we await confirmation of what the decision will be. It is looking increasingly likely that Ched Evans will be without a club, three years after leaving prison after serving two and a half years for rape and that underlines what a contentious issue that has been from the start. Three people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman’s body was found in the grounds of a primary school. The victim was discovered by a police officer at heartsjunior discovered by a police officer at hearts junior school in Shrewsbury yesterday. The way we shop is changing and figures for the pre-Christmas period atjohn Lewis seem to show more and more of us are shopping online. It said its sales in the five weeks to Christmas rose by 4.8% to £777 million, largely driven by online customers using its click-and-collect service. Our business correspondent, Emma Simpson, now reports. john Lewis, a winner yet again in the Christmas battle for our cash. For retailers, the busiest week is usually the last one with one final dash to the shops, not this time. Rememberthis? Black Friday mayhem, a day for huge discounts. There was no chaos forjohn Lewis but it was busier than Christmas, the best week of trading in its history. Even so, the boss says the industry needs a rethink on this new shopping phenomenon. My personal hope is that this is the high watermark for Black Friday. I don’t think we can put the genie back in the bottle, I think absolutely those discounts, particularly in the electrical market, that will be a feature but do we need to stoke that fire any more? I personally hope not. It was Internet shopping which drove sales up by 19% on last year, accounting for more than a third ofjohn Lewis’ Christmas business. Sales in traditional shops, though, were flat, the role of the store is changing. For the first time atjohn Lewis, more people collected their online orders here in stores than got their parcels delivered to their homes. For retailers, logistics have been key this Christmas and at times, the industry struggled to cope. Now the boss ofjohn Lewis reckons in future, all this convenience will come at a price. That could mean charging more to make deliveries cost-effective. Meanwhile, experts are wondering what the true cost of Black Friday will be to retailers’ pockets. It’s about selling the same amount but doing it as a discount. Some retailers likejohn Lewis will manage margin well and will probably do well in profit terms. Other retailers aren’t quite there. In other words, not everyone will be a winner in the Christmas retail story. Almost 40 bodies have now been recovered after an AirAsia plane crashed in the java Sea last Sunday. But the hunt is still on for any sign of the flight data recorders which might give some clue as to why the plane crashed, killing all 162 passengers and crew. The plane took off from the Indonesian city of Surabaya from where our correspondent, Martin Patience, sent this report. For this family, it was supposed to be the best of times, a New Year’s holiday in Singapore. But they died as they lived, together, in the AirAsia crash. Only the bodies of 10-year old Steffi, described as a cheerful girl, and her mother, have been retrieved. Five other members of the family are still missing at sea. This is a crushing blow to the family, says her uncle. It wasn’t a small accident, it was my mother, my sister, my brother-in-law, my nieces and nephews. So far, more than 30 bodies have been recovered but only a handful of them have been identified and returned to their families. As this operation goes on, the task of finding all the bodies and identifying them will only get harder. Out in the java Sea, the hunt continues for debris and the plane’s black box but authorities are widening the search area as bodies are being carried away by strong currents. Families want their loved ones back to start the burials. Hopefully God will help reunite the family, says Steffi’s uncle. Relatives light paper money, an Asian tradition that is believed to bring comfort to departed souls, but it is those left behind who will have to deal with the grief. Firefighters in Australia say they have just a small amount of time to fight bush fires which have been raging near Adelaide before temperatures begin to rise again over the next few days. Dozens of homes have been destroyed or badly damaged and nearly 30 people injured. jon Donnison reports. For a fourth day, the Adelaide Hills continue to burn. Thousands have been forced to flee. Some have returned to find they have lost all that they own. They wouldn’t let us come and save our house unfortunately. Have you lost everything? Everything. All my possessions and documents and paperwork. I lost my pets, dogs, a few cards, collectables all gone. Today, weather conditions eased slightly, allowing a brief window to try to bring the fire under control. We want it contained before the weather changes. We’re expecting more hot weather which will create conditions for the fire to escape and we would like to contain it within its general perimeter. Planes known as air tankers, capable of dumping over 10,000 litres of water and fire retardant at a time, are being used and more than 500 firefighters, many of them volunteers, are working round the clock. The Adelaide Hills are not densely populated but there are fears huge numbers of cattle and sheep have also perished. And other wildlife has suffered too. This was a shelter for orphaned animals. When they turned up here, I could see the house was well alight and Ijust said to them, let it go, save my animals, and we did. People here are well used to the threat of bushfires, many see it as all part of Australian life. Others, though, say climate change is making the fire season increasingly treacherous. And if you’re still wondering how to dispose of your Christmas tree this year, one zoo in Cambridgeshire has a suggestion. Lions at Linton Zoological Gardens are being given old trees to play with as a post-Christmas treat. Staff there say that real Christmas trees are ""like catnip"" to the resident big cats, who play with them like toys. Several members of the public have already donated their trees and the lions are said to be having hours of fun. Time for a look at the weather. It’s been a cold grey morning and this afternoon we will keep a lot about cloud, fairly breezy as well. One or two breaks in the cloud across parts of the Northern Midlands and northern England but sunshine is hard to come by and you can see there is still plenty of cloud cover. Eastern Scotland might see the odd break in the next couple of hours. Some patchy rain, more overcast in western Scotland. Plenty of cloud coverage in Northern Ireland at temperatures should recover to double figures. Much colder in the east with that thick cloud in east Anglia. And breezy on the south coast, with the odd spot of rain. South-west England, temperatures will again recover to double figures. The breeze stayed in the night and more rain gathers in the north-west, and approaching front moving south which could be wintry in the Scottish mountains but with the cloud, rain and breeze, starting tomorrow morning around five to 7 degrees. A touch cold in Northern Ireland with the risk of ice and clearer skies in the early hours here but elsewhere, cloudy start but the rain moves south and are brightening. In the afternoon, a much brighter prospect, cloudy with further outbreaks of rain in East Anglia and the south-east and temperatures not far off average. The weather is set to change in the second half of the week with deeper areas of low pressure wringing wet and windy conditions. The first of those through Wednesday, strengthening winds, severe gales in exposed places with heavy rain and perhaps not reaching the South East where it should stay Trout and a bit cloudy and not particularly cold. The reason for the change is being driven by the jet stream. That could strengthen to around 200 mph by the end of the week. The main part of the wins will be south of Iceland and that will steer this low pressure system. Some uncertainty as to how that will strengthen but it looks like the main part will be just to the north of us with us getting the tail end of the wet and windy weather with stormy conditions in the north-west but we need to tie down the details over the next couple of days.

And after the Christmas railway chaos, the government tells Network Rail it must improve. Christmas decorations come down, election campaigning begins, four month goes to the polls. Children will begin tucking into free school lunches as the new policy begins. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. A bitter row has broken out between the two main parties over how much the next government will cost. The Conservatives say there will be chaos if Ed Miliband becomes the next Prime minister, accusing him of making billions of pounds of unfunded pledges. Labour described this as a political smear and insisted its plans are fully funded. Ed Miliband said the party was offering ""hope not falsehoods."" Here’s our political editor, Nick Robinson. Elections are just a little like Christmas. Once the fuss is over, once the presents have been unwrapped, someone has to pick up the bill. Political leaders are under pressure to spell out who. When Ed Miliband peered into the future today at the pre-election rally, he concluded, and no surprise here, if the Tories win in May, it is the NHS and everyone but the rich who will pay the price. This is nothing less than once in a generation fight about who the country works for. Is a plan where only a few at the top can succeed and public services are threatened or Labour plan that puts working people first, deals with the deficit and protects the NHS. A little over an hour later five Tory Cabinet ministers strode out to say, this is not much of a surprise. They say Labour will borrow more and tax more because they have made promises they cannot afford. Making spending commitments is the easiest thing in the world. They are superficially attractive. They get applause from lobby groups. They get you headlines. Unfunded spending commitments are made with borrowed money and the price is paid by future tax payers. A Tory party document today claimed Labour had committed spending £20,000,000,000 more they cannot pay for next year alone. All these plans cost money. Labour have no credible proposals for how to pay for them. I struggle is Tory party election document has been cunningly disguised to look awfully like this, the official budget red book. The official figures in here were produced by independent government officials but, and it is a mighty big but, the assumptions they were asked to cost, the policies themselves, were drawn up, not by civil servants, but by Tory Party advisers. Tory claims range from the big two the very small. Labour has promised to make cycling safer. -- small. Labour has promised to make cycling safer. -- they have promised. Labour’s plight, that is nonsense. They have guaranteed patients will get a guaranteed GP appointment in A8 hours. Estimates say that will cost £15 billion next year alone. say that will cost £15 billion next yearalone. Labour says say that will cost £15 billion next year alone. Labour says it can pay for it, in part with the mansion tax on expensive homes. What about cuts to council budgets which Labour has often criticised? Verse in them would cost £3.3 billion next year. -- reversing them. Labour says it has not made any such promises. They are untrue and fabricated. The Tories have said you have criticised library closures, sure start services, wouldn’t any voter assume we would spend more on local councils? It is credible we will have to cut spending next year. George Osborne failed to balance the budget this year, as planned. That means we will inherit a big deficit and that means cuts. What should voters treat as rubbish? There may only be one more day of Christmas yet but we have 122 days of this election campaign to try and find the answer. Our economics editor, Robert Peston, is here. You’ve been looking at the figures. How much do we know for sure about both parties spending commitments? The sad truth is that it is claimed and counterclaim. I am not sure we are that much wiser about how prudent a Labour government or a Tory government would be after the next election. This is a mighty big number, this £21,000,000,000 additional spending commitment that the Tories claim Labour have for the first year of the government. When you do go through the detail, quite a lot of these things are criticisms made by Labour that have been translated by Tory advisers into so-called cast iron commitments to spend more, which allows Ed Balls to say, it isjust spend more, which allows Ed Balls to say, it is just not true. We criticise but it does not mean we will reverse. It is confusing for voters. You should we trust? We had the former head of the civil service, a fairly respected chap, saying he would like to see independent scrutiny by office budget responsibility ideally, the agency set up by the government to scrutinise its own finances. Independent scrutiny of all the main parties manifesto commitments so that we, as voters, could have a bit more confidence about, frankly, he would be spending more and he would be spending less, and who we can trust with our money? More than 8,000 people have now died of Ebola in the worst affected countries in West Africa since the latest outbreak began almost a year ago. Here a British nurse who fell ill after working for the charity, Save the Children, in Sierra Leone is now in a critical but stable condition. The charity says it is determined to find out how Pauline Cafferkey became infected. Our global health correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, is in Sierra Leone. She begins her report from a health centre close to Freetown where Pauline Cafferkey had been working. The most dangerous part of one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. Pauline Cafferkey worked at this Italian run Ebola-holding centre when she first arrived in Sierra Leone. Health workers are hosed down with disinfectant, fresh from testing suspected Ebola patients. They are potentially covered in the virus. One mistake here could be fatal. It is still unclear how Pauline Cafferkey became infected. Save the Children have promised an extra ordinary review. We will certainly be focusing on how personal protection equipment is used, how it is put on. More importantly, how it is taken off. The kind of contact people have had in the centre and perhaps also outside. It will be a very full and thorough review. Medics have to use extreme caution when handling samples. More than 100 health workers have died in this country fighting Ebola. Almost all of them were Sierra Leonean. Pauline spent almost two weeks doing this kind of work before moving to the Save the Children facility. She was a very committed nurse, since thevery first day. She went through the training here with us and through the mentorship programme. Always very keen to look after patients in a proper way. She was a real nurse. Will these developments put other medics off volunteering? Absolutely not. People have said to us they had to set up all those precautions because there would not be volunteers. That is nonsense. We volunteered for Afghanistan, Haiti, we volunteered for Gaza. We are quite prepared to take that risk. We have a job to do and we need to be supported, not blocked, from doing ourjob. Security around the Save the Children site where Pauline worked when she was infected was tight. We were not allowed in. This is the second time a medic here has caught Ebola. The Cu ban doctor survived after treatment. Almost 8,000 people have died in this unprecedented outbreak so far. More than 20,000 have been infected. As Pauline Cafferkey fights for her life back in London, her colleagues continue to save the lives of victims here. Health workers understand the risks involved but they are committed to the crucial cause of bringing this outbreak under control. Oldham Athletic have not ruled out signing convicted rapist Ched Evans, despite mounting pressure from fans, sponsors and police to do so. The club says talks about the future of the 26-year-old continue. This report from our Sports Editor, Dan Roan, contains some flash photography. Released from prison 3 months ago, Ched Evans hoped he would walk straight back into football. Oldham Athletic held a closed training session without the convicted rapist. They are shelving plans to unveil as a new player against a fierce backlash. It is a difficult situation. We want what is best for the club. What the board decides, I will be part of. Tonight the board remained in a quandary. Sky Oldham Athletic is not making an official announcement regarding speculation concerning Ched Evans. We continue to having to dip bodies, such as the PFA, and will conduct due diligence in this matter. He maintains his innocence. Despite his goals, Sheffield United withdrew an offer for him to train with them. Old and wanted to offer Evans a return to football but 27,000 people have signed a petition against the idea. -- old unwanted. My views are completely different to the man next door may be. Ido not want to be involved in Oldham Athletic if they are going to employee Ched Evans. Others believe he has served his time and should return to football. His offence was awful and his punishment was prison and not unemployment. At some point he will have to return to work. That is a matter for him and those who want to employ him. One of the most-- matter for him and those who want to employ him. One of the most -- the controversy continues. The indecision only goes to underline the dilemma that clubs face over such a toxic controversy. If they decide ultimately not to offer Evans a contract, it is hard in all honesty to see where he will play football in this country. Four hospitals have announced measures. Around 1/3 of those arriving at A&E do not need emergency care. They’re advising people to consider other options such as the NHS 111 helpline. Lebanon has imposed new visa restrictions on Syrians entering the country as it struggles to cope with a massive influx of refugees from the civil war there. just over a million Syrian refugees are officially registered in Lebanon but the actual figure is likely to be much higher. They now account for at least one in four of Lebanon’s total population. From northern Lebanon, Paul Wood sent this report. Lebanese fear for their future. This is one sign of that, the re-emergence of militia. These are Christians, protecting their town from jihadis who arrive with Muslim refugees from Syria. The Syrian influx has deepened Syrian and sectarian divisions in this fragile country. Some worry it will mean a new civil war. The refugees are a crisis for Lebanese Sunni. This town grew by more than 50% when 3500 refugees came. They are Muslims from the same Sunni sect. A few weeks ago, an angry mob of locals came and burned the campus right down to the foundations. The Lebanese has -- have always been extremely nervous about establishing permanent refugee populations. The tensions are becoming ever more visible. In a local cafe, they tell me of an economic catastrophe. Wages are down, rents are up, jobs disappearing. The refugees get aid while our people are dying of hunger. Most of our men are unemployed welder refugees get it all. If our government cannot help us, maybe they should give us Syrian citizenship. At least then we will get food. There are no sectarian issues here. It is aboutjobs. I used to work and got paid $1000 a month. The company replaced me with lI-macro Syrians. Refugees like Mohammed are under curfew and told they cannot go out after 6 p.m. For the he is not resentful. -- they cannot go out after 6 p.m. For the he is not resentful. -- six p.m.. He is not resentful. Lebanese also need to help, he says. God help them. Still, I have to think of myself. What they want above all is to go back to Syria. Both the refugees and the Lebanese government know there is little chance of that. The time is 6:17pm. Our top story this evening: Labour and Conservatives argue over who can be trusted with the economy after the general election. And coming up: If you’re looking for FA Cup romance, look Wimbledon play Liverpool tonight. 27 years after their famous engagement. Later on BBC London, the row over how best to treat the growing obesity crisis and meeting a surgeon in London who speaks out against NHS policy. An art project which launched many careers It’s been stranded on its side since Saturday in the middle of the Solent. On board the cargo ship are more than a thousand jaguars and Landrovers worth millions of pounds. The Hurg Osarka was deliberately run aground when it started listing dangerously after it left port in Southampton. Salvage experts are expected to take days to decide how best to refloat it. Duncan Kennedy is in Southampton. Two days after it floundered, the Hurg Osarka has been boarded by salvage experts. They used this target is a bridging point to clamber on board. From the air, you can see it against the superstructure of the grounded vessel. These pictures were taken at high tide, but look at the rudder and propeller, visible out of the water. Here on this sandbank, the Solent is a couple of metres deep. The ship was deliberately run aground by its captain and pilot after it started listing, a move praised by maritime experts today. The pilot and captain would have been aware that the ship was tilting and they needed to decide that this was as ditch -- and they needed to decide that this was as ditch -- dangerous situation to be in, and it was really quite a good it for thought. Today the salvage teams spent several hours on board, weaving their way through decking and angled staircases, assessing the impact of the grounding. It’s only by getting those experts on board that the salvage people will understand what has happened to all of the cargo and other artefacts on board. 1400 cars, 500 tonnes of fuel oil. How much has that shifted about, and how much effect will it have on the salvage operation? Tonight this photo emerged, taken on the vessel before it set sail on Saturday, showing some of the 105jCB diggers on board. Forfouryears, some of the 105jCB diggers on board. For four years, Mark board. Forfouryears, Mark Brooks helped load onto the great M1 and he believes many of them will still be intact. The cars are very secure -- onto the Hurg Osarka. The heavy plant machinery uses chains to help them on the deck, so they are designed to withstand gale force winds, so most of the machine around cars should be in place. The salvage operators confirm that the vessel is not leaking but the calm weather of the Isle of Wight will not last, and this ship could be here well into the New Year. All four big supermarkets have announced that further fuel price cuts will take effect this week, bringing petrol even closer to £1 a litre. Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Asda are all reducing prices by 2p a litre on both petrol and diesel. It follows the recent halving of the oil price, with Brent Crude now costing less than $55 a barrel. The boss ofjohn Lewis has warned that UK firms shouldn’t ""stoke the fire"" by encouraging heavy discounting on Black Friday. The retailer saw its biggest trading week at the end of November, thanks to the US-inspired sale. Andy Street says he can’t put the ""genie back in the bottle"" but he hopes the phenomenon has reached its peak. Our Business Correspondent Emma Simpson’s report contains flash photography. Who can forget this, Black Friday, bargains galore, and people fighting to get their hands on them? This was an event entirely imported from the States, and it is -- an event entirely imported from the States, and it is -- it has now brought disruption to our Christmas shopping patterns as well. john Lewis was dreaming that Monty the Penguin would help deliver its festive sales, but the peak was much earlier, on Black Friday, the biggest trading day ever. The boss has not fallen in love with the new trend. My personal hope is that this is the sort of high water mark for Black Friday. I don’t think we can put the genie back in the bottle. I think those discounts, particularly in the electrical market, that will be a feature, but do we need to stoke that fire any more? I personally hope not. There was no chaos here, just record clicks. That helped drive the online sales up 19% on last year and Internet shopping made up more than one third ofjohn Lewis’s Christmas sales, and for the first time, more than half of those online orders were picked up in-store through click and collect. Ifjohn Lewis is anything to go by, we changed the way we shop this Christmas. Instead of that last-minute surge, we went on a spending spree much earlier in the season. And many in the industry must now be wondering whether Black Friday was such a good idea. It condenses a lot of trade into a single day and logistically, operationally, that is hard to deal with. The other problem about Black Friday is that you are not necessarily creating new demand, you are just servicing existing necessarily creating new demand, you arejust servicing existing demand at a discount. And that can ultimately hit profits, the numbers that really matter for retailers. Emma Simpson, BBC News. The wreck of a cargo ship which sank and lost eight lives has been located on the Pentland Firth. It has been found using by ship using sonar equipment and a life raft has been recovered. The crew did not have time to send out a distress signal. Now it was perhaps the most famous FA Cup final upset in the history of the competition, the mighty Liverpool beaten by the minnows of Wimbledon at Wembley in 1988. Well, injust over an hour’s time, the two teams meet again in the cup for the first time since then. But in the intervening years a lot has changed for Wimbledon, including theirground. joe Wilson is there now. joe. just a lucky 5000 here this evening, and so body FA Cup third Round this season has flirted with romance with the likes of Wrexham and Blyth Spartans without giving us a Mills and Boon, but no team embodies the FA Cup dream more than Wimbledon. Even in the era where the 9aP Wimbledon. Even in the era where the gap between the football rich and poor might seem greater than ever. The pitch in south London has been carefully prepared for this evening. This fixture is inextricably lit with history. The FA Cup will always have 1988 -- linked. When Wimbledon’s upstarts beat the Liverpool aristocrats in the final. Dave Beasant’s penalty save and all. To go from non-league to get to the top flight and then win the FA Cup, I don’t think anyone will ever do that again. Because of the money in the game. That cup winning Wimbledon team relocated to Buckinghamshire and became the MK Dons. It was highly contentious and I should probably hide that scar fear, because in south London the fans decided to start again from scratch -- fans decided to start again from scratch -- that scarf here. They formed AFC Wimbledon and considered themselves the true custodians of the team’s identity. Trials were held on Wimbledon Common and five promotions in nine seasons followed. Now in the fourth tier of English football, AFC Wimbledon have got a lower league legend as Adebayo Akinfenwa says he can bench press over 18 stone. There are not many footballers like me in the world, and I think when Liverpool see me warming up they will have a little look over, but no, all of the banter aside, I’m looking forward to the game, and hopefully we can beat Liverpool at football. The club share the same rules in different worlds. Now through this tunnel will stride Liverpool’s internationals. We have to go there with the right mentality and do everything we can to prepare for the game, like we always do. Wimbledon once rose from the parks to cup winners in a different football era. The new Wimbledon face new challenges, but the cup always stays the same. They have won the FA Cup. And you can see if Wimbledon can repeat history as the game against Liverpool is live on Match of the Day on BBC1. Coverage starts at 7.30pm this evening. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Alex Deakin. A bit ofa A bit of a grey Monday across the UK with lots of cloud and we will see the cloud overnight, which will help to keep the temperature is up at a relatively mild level. Not much rain, but the rain, but the rainbow will help to keep the temperature is UP will help to keep the temperature is up at a relatively mild level. Not much rain, but the rainbow about the liberal with two bands approaching from the West, -- liberal with two bands approaching from the West, -- pep up a little. Another band will work into North West Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the rain could be heavy in places and much of eastern England stays dry and it could turn foggy with temperatures a few degrees above freezing but the possibility of things being cold enough for a touch of ice across Northern Ireland. Skies should brighten, and the two bands of rain will trudge eastwards, and behind the second one, it will brighten up nicely for the afternoon with brief sunshine developing across Wales in south-west England and sunny spells across most of Scotland. There will be some lively showers, but even those should fade through the day but there might be some snow over the hills. Generally dry and sunny across eastern Scotland with sunny spells for Northern Ireland in northern England and temperatures only six or 7 degrees, feeling fresh despite sunshine and after a damp start, much brighterthan despite sunshine and after a damp start, much brighter than the afternoon. But East Anglia and the south-east will keep cloudy skies and the rain will pep up in the afternoon. That does scoot away and then things turn: Wednesday morning with a touch of Frost and some early sunshine. Eastern area stay dry but the cloud invades from the West, and outbreaks of rain and the winds whipped up on Wednesday with may be severe gales in the far north of Scotland, but mild air and the temperatures will go back up to double figures. The winds can be a feature of the weather later this week and it will get lively on Friday in particular, so prepare for a strong winds and rain at the end of the week and you might have to see some warnings with the wet weather coming our way over the next few days. We will keep you posted. Westminster. A reminderof our main story: Labour and Conservatives argue over who can be trusted with Tonight on BBC London News. The Mayor’s multi-million pound housing schemes aimed at creating thousands of new homes. Why critics say it’s too little too late. It’s only a few thousand homes. What we really need is a massive housebuilding programme of affordable housing. It comes as City Hall sources predicted London’s population would reach a record high over the next month. Also tonight. Is there any elderly people in the crowd? After the Christmas chaos at two of London’s major railway stations, the government tells Network Rail it must improve. The casualties of last year’s floods. We speak to a couple who had to sell up and move on. More than 70 years since he fought the battle of Britain, a veteran tells us why the battle is now on to say the memorial to his former comrades. There should be some place where people could come to have quieter moments of thought and prayer. Good evening and welcome to BBC London’s early evening news with me, Asad Ahmad. A £220 million cash injection has been announced by Mayor Boris johnson to help solve London’s housing crisis. Most of the money will be used to speed-up the completion of thousands new homes by 2020. In another scheme, buyers will be able to purchase a property without a mortgage or deposit. It comes on the day that City Hall sources have predicted that London’s population will reach a record high over the next month. The mayor’s critics say his announcements have come too late for many Londoners, and he’s simply not building enough homes. Here’s our Political correspondent, Karl Mercer. ",,
24,BBC1 London,5-jan-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten, a taste of what’s to come, as the parties debate spending priorities ahead of the election. There are four months to polling day, but Labour is already spelling out its version of the choice voters will face. It’s a choice between a Tory plan where only a few at the top can succeed and where our public services are threatened, or a Labour plan that puts working people first. But Conservative Ministers talked of a different choice, accusing Labour of making uncosted pledges. Continue on the road to a stronger economy, that a competent Conservative team and have a long-term plan. Or choose the chaos of over £20 billion of unfunded spending promises. We’ll be asking what today tells us about the likely form and tone of the campaign. Also tonight: The Scottish nurse diagnosed with Ebola is said to be critical but stable. We’ll be reporting from the West African country where she was based. Britain’s biggest supermarkets cut the price of petrol again as the cost of oil tumbles. The convicted rapist, Ched Evans, might still be signed by Oldham Athletic. The club says it’s still deliberating. And why the manic shopping of Black Friday might not have been such good news for the high street. Later on BBC London: We look at money set aside to help Londoners afford rents and buy homes, but is it too little too late? And an apology from the Government after the Christmas chaos on the railways hit thousands of commuters. Good evening. Polling day is four months away, but political leaders have started the new year with a round of intensive campaigning. Ed Miliband said Labour wanted to sweep away the ""food banks and bank bonuses"" which he said were the Conservative legacy. And he rejected claims that Labour had amassed £20 billion worth of unfunded spending pledges. The Chancellor, George Osborne, said Labour would take the UK back to an ""economic mess"". Our political editor, Nick Robinson, reports. Elections are just a little like Christmas, once the fuss is over, once the presents have been unwrapped, someone has to pick up the bill. And political leaders are under pressure to spell out who. Where are they? When Ed Miliband peered into the future today he concluded, and no surprise here, thatif concluded, and no surprise here, that if the Tories win in May it’s the NHS and everyone but the rich who will pay the price. This is nothing less than a once in a generation fight about who our country works for. It is a choice between a plan where only a few at the top can succeed and our public services are threatened. Or a Labour plan that puts working people first, deals with the deficit, and protects our NHS. A little over an hour later no fewer than five Tory Cabinet Ministers strode out to say that if Labour, they’ll borrow more and tax more because they’ve made spending promises they can’t afford. What I’ve learnt doing this job is that making spending commitments is the easiest thing in the world. Spending commitments are superficially commitments are su perficially attractive. commitments are superficially attractive. They get ready applause from lobby groups. They get you headlines. But unfunded spending commitments are made with borrowed money and the price is paid by future taxpayers. A Tory party document today claimed that Labour have committed to spending £20 million more that they can’t pay for next year alone. All these plans cost money, yet Labour have no credible proposals for how to pay for them. Get this wrong and within four months they’ll be fighting each other to become the next Leader of the Opposition. This Tory Party election document has been cunningly disguised to look awfully like this, the Treasury’s official bucket Red Book. The figures in here were produced by independent Government officials. But, and it is a mighty bit but, the asumps they were asked to cost, the policies themselves, were drawn up not by civil servants but Tory Party advisers. The Tory claims range from the big to the very small. Like Labour’s prompts to make cycling safer and more accessible, costing £63 million. Labour’s reply, that’s nonsense. Much more significant though is their promise that all patients should get a guaranteed GP appointment within A8 hours. The official estimate is that would cost £1.3 billion next year alone. Ten times Labour’s original estimate. But the party says they could pay for it, in part with a new mansion tax on expensive houses. What then about cuts to council budgets which Labour has often criticised? The Tories say reversing that would cost £3.3 billion next year. Labour say they they’ve never made any such promise. They say all parties planned should be assessed independently not by their political enemies. These are untrue. They are in many case as completely fabricated. In some cases totally wrong in their analysis. You say untruths and smears but the Tories point out you have criticised library closures, Sure Start closures, closures in social care. Wouldn’t any ordinary voter assume you would spend more on local councils? It’s really regrettable we’ll have to cut spending next year, but the reason is David Cameron and George Osborne failed to balance the bucket this year as they planned, we’ll inherit a big defendant and that will mean cuts. So which promises and which claims should voters treat as, well, rubbish? There may be only one more day of Christmas left, but cheer up, we’ve got 122 days of this election campaign to try and find the answer. And Nick Robinson is in Westminster. ~ I hazard a guess there won’t be many people downloading this Tory election Government or this Labour rebuttal Government to try and assess for themselves what the truth is. There may be many people screaming at the television, tell us, find someone independent who will tell us what to believe in these two rival claims. Labour say there would be a way of doing that. It would be if the independent office for budget responsibility were to assess their spending plans andindeed were to assess their spending plans and indeed all political parties. They’ve got the backing of the former Cabinet Secretary, Lord Gus O’Donnell and the Conservative chairman of the Treasury Select Committee to do that. But crucially they don’t have the backing of the Government. The Chancellor says it wouldn’t be the right thing for this newish organisation, the OBR, to do. And therefore you are forced as voters to make your own judgment, to hear the claims and the counterclaims, to assess, essentially, this simple question. Who do you trust? Do you trust Labour when they say they can create a fairer society, a stronger set of public services that they can do it and they can do it without threatening the public finances? Do you trust the Tories when they claim they can get the public finances under control, but without threatening the NHS or outthreatening those crucial public services? Of course you may trust neither of them. In the end it won’t be a question of facts and figures and dossiers, it’s aboutjudgment and it’s yours. Nick, thank you. The Scottish nurse diagnosed with Ebola after returning from Sierra Leone is said to be in a critical but stable condition at a hospital in London. Pauline Cafferkey had been working with the charity Save the Children in Sierra Leone, one of the worst-affected countries in the latest oubtreak. The latest official assessment is that more than 8,000 people have died of Ebola in West Africa in the past year. Our global health correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, is in Sierra Leone. She starts her report at a health centre close to Freetown, where Pauline Cafferkey had been working. The most dangerous part of one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.

Security around the Save the Children site where Pauline worked when she was infected was tight. We were not allowed in. This is the second time a medic here has caught Ebola. The Cu ban doctor survived after treatment. Almost 8,000 people have died in this unprecedented outbreak so far. More than 20,000 have been infected. As Pauline Cafferkey fights for her life back in London, her colleagues continue to save the lives of victims here. Health workers understand the risks involved but they are committed to the crucial cause of bringing this outbreak under control. The UK’s big supermarkets are cutting petrol and diesel prices again, as the cost of oil has fallen to its lowest level since 2009. To add to the sense of volatility in the global economy, the euro has fallen to a nine-year low against the dollar. Our economics editor, Robert Peston, is here. Robert, the graph tells its own story, but what’s the impact of lower oil prices? We’ve seen the oil price halve over just a few months. In America, West ta few months. In America, West Texas intermediate is below $50 for a bit today. What’s going on is that there’s a bit of a slowdown in some parts of the world, we’ll be talking about the eurozone in a minute. China is slowing down. But, importantly, supply is going up. Russia, pumping record amounts of oil in the non-Soviet era. Russia is dependent on oil and gas, so pumping it up to keep the revenues flowing. Iraq saying today it was upping its production. There is more oil than the world needs. Therefore we’re back at a price we have not seen since the world economy was in that terrible recession back in 2009. The good news is America’s economy is still going quite strongly. Our economy isn’t doing too badly. But it does reflect some parts of the world not do so well. The euro is slumping to levels we haven’t seen in nine years. That’s because the eurozone continues to stagnate. Part of that is manifested in inflation, which is turning into deflation. We have German figures on inflation today just 0. deflation. We have German figures on inflation todayjust 0. 1% rate of inflation. On Wednesday we’re likely to hear that prices across the eurozone on average fell. We are seeing deflation. Now why does that matter? It matters because if businesses and households in the eurozone think prices are going to continue to go down, then there’s no reason to invest. If you delay spending you get better deals. When investment and spending is delayed the economy slows further. That is why we are anticipating that the European Central Bank will take evasive action towards the end of this month by full-scale quantitative easing, something we’ve not seen in the eurozone yet. That’s purchases of government bonds, pushing down the price of money further. When the price of money falls, investors don’t want it hold the euro, the euro falls. This reflects significant weakness throughout the eurozone. So what you put it together and what does it tell us for this country? A lower oil price, very good news. It puts money in our pockets, however the eurozone is still our biggest export market. What’s going on there is bad news for us. How will it all end up? Will the bad outweigh the good? We’re only a few years into the new year, I don’t know. We’re living in interesting, volatile times. Thank you very much. Four hospitals in England have declared major incidents, following a surge in demand at accident and emergency units. Scarborough and Lincolnshire hospitals announced new measures today, and two main hospitals in Gloucestershire have declared a major incident for the second time in a month. Gloucestershire Royal and Cheltenham General say around one third of those arriving at A&E do not need emergency care. Three people have been arrested on suspicion of murder, after the body of a woman was found in the grounds of a primary school in Shrewsbury. West Mercia Police said the victim is thought to be in her early 20s. The wreck of a cargo ship, which capsized and sank with the loss of eight lives, has been located on the seabed in the eastern approaches to the Pentland Firth. It has has been found by a ship using sonar equipment. A life raft has also been recovered. Oldham Athletic Football Club says it’s still considering taking on the player Ched Evans, who was convicted of rape in 2012. The club says talks are ongoing, but more than 20,000 people have signed an online petition urging Oldham not to sign him. The club says it’s in a ""very difficult situation"". This report by our sports editor, Dan Roan, contains some flash photography. Released from prison three months ago, Ched Evans hoped he would walk straight back into football. The reality is proving somewhat different. This is where the striker was meant to be this morning. Instead, with the pressure intensifying, Oldham Athletic held a closed training session without the convicted rapist, the League One club shelving plans to unveil him as their new player in the face of a fierce public backlash. It’s a very difficult situation. Of course, we want what’s best for the club. Whatever the board decide, I’ll be a part of. Having spent all day weighing up the decision, tonight, the board remained in a quandary. Oldham Athletic is not, at this stage, making any official announcement with regard to the speculation concerning Ched Evans. Whilst acknowledging the considerable media attention, we continue to have conversations with representative bodies, such as the PFA, and will conduct due diligence with regard to any decision we make on this matter. Evans served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011 but maintains his innocence. Despite his goals, former club Sheffield United withdrew an offer for him to train with them, after criticism from sponsors and celebrity fans. Oldham wanted to offer Evans a return to football, but 25,000 people have already signed a petition against the idea and some at the club is unhappy. He’s a role model to people, at the end of the day. My views on it are completely different to the man next door maybe, but my opinion is that I don’t want to be involved in Oldham Athletic, if they’re going to employ Ched Evans. Others however believe the 26-year-old has served his time and should be free to return to his profession. Ched Evans’ offence was awful. His punishment was prison not unemployment. At some point, he’s going to have to return to work. The question is what he does. That’s really a matter for him and those who wish to employ him. With Oldham being urged not to sign the striker by senior politicians and the local Police Commissioner, uncertainty now surrounds the deal. Tonight, Ched Evans’ future here hangs in the balance. Oldham’s indecision underlining the dilemma clubs face over one of the game’s most devicive issues, but if they don’t offer him a way back into the sport, the question is whether anybody will. Syrian refugees, trying to enter Lebanon, are facing new visa restrictions, as the Lebanese authorities struggle to cope with a huge influx of Syrians fleeing the civil war. just over a million Syrian refugees are officially registered in Lebanon, but the actual figure is likely to be much higher. They are now said to account for at least one in four of Lebanon’s total population. From northern Lebanon, our correspondent, Paul Wood, sent this report. Lebanese fear for their future. One sign of that - the re-emergence of militias. These are Christians protecting their town from jihadis, who arrived with Muslim refugees from Syria. The Syrian influx has deepened religious divisions in this fragile country. Some worry of a new Civil War. The refugees are a crisis for Lebanese Sunnis too. The population here is 6,500. It grew by 50% when 3,500 refugees came. Everyone here, Lebanese and Syrian, are Sunni Muslim. That helps little. This was a new camp for Syrians paid for by an international charity. But a few weeks ago, an angry mob of locals came and burned the canvas to the foundations. The Lebanese have always been extremely nervous about establishing permanent refugee populations. The Syrians are dispersed around the country and almost hidden. The tensions are becoming ever more visible. Lebanese locals speak of an economic catastrophe: wages down, rents up, jobs disappearing. TRANSLATION: I used to get paid $1,000 a month. The company replaced me with four Syrians for that money. The refugees stack their motorcycles with food with aid money. Our men arejobless, while the refugees get it all. TRANSLATION: If our government cannot help us, maybe they should give us Syrian citizenship. At least then we will get food. Next door, the grocery shop ledger records the debts of those who can’t pay. There are many more Lebanese names here than Syrian. The refugees are under curfew. They hurry to get their shopping done before nightfall. They live scattered around the town, tolerated not welcomed. ""The Lebanese also need to work, may God help them,"" he says, ""but I have to think of myself first."" What they want, above all, is to go back to Syria, but both the refugees and the Lebanese government know there’s little chance of that. Thousands of Germans have marched in Dresden tonight, protesting against what they see as the growing influence of Islam. But thousands more have taken part in pro-immigration rallies in four cities. The rapid rise of the group, calling itself Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West, has alarmed the German government. Chancellor Merkel called its leaders racists, as our correspondent, jenny Hill, reports from Dresden. ""We are the people,"" they shout. And their voice is getting louder. ""Germany for Germans,"" he says, ""no mosques in Germany. No mosques in Dresden."" Ellie moved here from West Germany. Too many foreigners there, she says. If you go through you won’t hear a German word. It’s not a good situation, if you have four daughters, four blonde, long-haired daughters. Immigration’s at a 20-year high in this country. The group behind this demonstration claims to be anti-Islamist. It’s increasingly popular. What’s shocked and perplexed the authorities are the sheer numbers here. Modern Germany is not used to scenes like this. And they’ve provoked disgust and shame. Tonight, the lights of Cologne Cathedral put out in protest. Counter-demonstrations were held in 11 German cities. Among those publicly condemning the group, the German Chancellor. ""Don’t follow these people. Too often they have prejudices, coldness, even hatred in their hearts."" But the voices persist. Immigration’s expected to be high on the agenda, when the Chancellor visits Britain later in the week. These scenes make many in Germany incomfortable, but they’ve provoked a debate which many also say can no longer be ignored. As Britain’s retailers reflect on the Christmas and New Year shopping period, one of the biggest names, john Lewis, revealed its biggest trading week on record. But that week was at the end of November, when heavy discounting, on so-called Black Friday, helped to boost sales. Andy Street, the managing director ofjohn Lewis, has warned that British firms should rethink the concept of Black Friday, because it created more volatility on the high street, as our business correspondent, Emma Simpson, tells us. Who can forget Black Friday, bargains galore and people fighting to get their hands on them. This was an offence, entirely imported from ~ "" BFI -- an event entirely imported from the States. It’s now brought disruption to our Christmas shopping patterns as well. john Lewis was dreaming that Monty the penguin would help deliver its festive sales, but the peak was much earlier on Black Friday, its biggest trading day ever. The boss hasn’t fall anyone love with this new trend. love with this new trend. My personal hope is that this is the high watermark for Black Friday. We cannot put the genie back in the bottle but absolutely though, Electrical discounts will be a feature. Do we need to stoke that fire any more, I personally hope not. There was no chaos here, just record clicks. That helped drive online sales by 19% on last year. Internet shopping made more than a third ofjohn Lewis’s Christmas sales and for the first time, more than half of those online orders were picked up in-store through click & collect. Ifjohn Lewis are anything to go by, we change the way we shop this Christmas, instead of that last-minute surge, we went on a spending spree, much earlier in the season. Many in the industry must now be wondering, whether Black Friday was such a good idea? It condenses a lot of trade into a single day and logistically and operationally that is difficult to deal with. The other problem is that you are not necessarily creating new demand, you are servicing existing demand at a discount. And that can ultimately hits profits, the numbers that do matter for retailers.

A ""major incident"" has been declared in Surrey as hospitals struggle to cope with emergency patients. People are being asked not to go to A&E unless it’s an absolute emergency. One of the hospitals issuing the warning is the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford. That’s where we can join Victoria Hollins. Managers here MBFIBQEFS i’IâI’â Say extreme pressure on the A&E department, at the moment. They say, as you mention, don’t come to A&E unless it is an absolute emergency. Waiting times are extremely long, they say. The message does seem to be getting through. I’ve spoken to a few people coming out of A&E and they say the advice is that the wait is around three hours. We know already that a handful of routine operations have been cancelled. They’re going to keep this under review as the week progresses. The problem is wider thanjust review as the week progresses. The problem is wider than just that one hospital? That’s right. It’s repeated at St Peters as well, where the same advice applies about A&E. We know there that they’ve cancelled around 30 outpatient appointments and again, a handful of operations. Neither hospital is clear exactly why the pressure is so great, at the moment. It is the time of the year, people putting off going to hospital until after the Christmas and new year period. We will have a clearer idea tomorrow when NHS England publishes the waiting times at A&E for the last two weeks of the year. That will give a clearer picture, notjust here in Surrey, but across the country. Thank you. The Government has apologised for the railway chaos which caused misery for thousands of Christmas travellers hit by overrunning engineering work. It left King’s Cross station closed and London Paddington shut for most of the docking day. It was a dreadful Christmas for some travellers, as thousands endured serious delays. I’ve been waiting for an hour and a half and I can’t see any East Coast train staff around here. Network Rail’s engineering work at Paddington and King’s Cross wasn’t completed by December 27th. Today the Transport Secretary apologised for the disruption and admitted that things could have been handled better. As I made clear at the time of the disruption at King’s Cross and Paddington after Christmas was totally unacceptable. Passengers deserve totally unacceptable. Passengers deserve a reliable rail service and clear information and they deserve rapid help when things go wrong. I’m sorry that in this case they didn’t get this. Over the last 12 days £200 million worth of improvements have been finished, including work at Reading and London Bridge. There are calls today for compensation for travellers who will be affected by long-term changes to services there. But it has all been overshadowed by the disruption. In his new year message the Prime Minister said Britain faced a choice between competence or chaos. Ministers at the DFT didn’t get their memo, because at Christmas we saw a combination of chaos and incompetence on our rail network, causing misery for passengers, who have seen their tickets rocket by 20%. Network Rail’s own report will be made public soon. The Government is promising to hold rail bosses to account for what happened. It’s milder than the weekend. It’s going to turn breezy and it will be quite unsettled. Lots of cloud around tonight. There’ll be a few spots of rain caught up in that. Underneath the cloud it will be mild. Temperatures no lower than 7 or 8 degrees. During your morning commute tomorrow you will have cloud above you. Through may be drizzly outbreaks of rain first thing.

Statistics issued by the Met Office today suggesting it was the warmest year across the UK on record. Warmest across the year, but we didn’t brake individual monthly temperature records. It was the fourth wettest year. The records go back to 1910. Most of us will get a splash of rain tonight. Bands of rain working west to east. Eastern areas staying dry.

Six hospitals declare major incidents amid the worst A&E waiting time figures for a decade. The NHS in England says it’s dealing with the highest number of ambulance calls and A&E attendances in the service’s history. We had 18 patients in our emergency department who were having to be cared for on beds, who were patients that needed to be admitted but there was no bed for them. The Health Secretary has acknowledged the pressure they’re under, but says nine out of 10 patients are seen on time.

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Waiting times in Accident & Emergency units in England are at their worst since performance targets began a decade ago. Between October and December last year, 92.6% of patients were being seen within four hours - the government target is 95%. Six hospitals in England have now declared ""major incidents"" and closed their A&E departments to all but emergency cases, because they said they couldn’t cope with demand. Our health correspondent Adam Brimelow reports. When a system is under pressure, when emergency staff are pushed to the limit, what does that mean for patients and the quality of care, including time taken for treatment? At this hospital, the emergency department is busier than ever before. Safety is always the priority, dealing with the most urgent cases first. Some have to wait, sometimes on trolleys in corridors. This year has been busier than any of us can remember, both in the number of patients attending and actually in-house sick they are. So that has placed a great strain on the whole of the hospital, notjust the A&E staph. Figures show a sharp decline in performance against the health service targets. 95% should be admitted or discharged within four hours. Overall, NHS England managed just 92 is -- four hours. Overall, NHS England managed just 92 is -- 90 2.6%. Six hospitals in England have declared major incidents, which means managers can call extra staff and delay routine activity to stem the number of patients coming in. We at 18 patients in our emergency department having to be cared for on beds. They needed to be admitted, but there was no bed for them. NHS leaders say the huge pressures on the service reflect changing expectations. We’ve seen a change in societal behaviour and how they want to use the help nervous. -- societal behaviour and how they want to use the help nervous. -- the health service. People expect things to happen immediately, so those services offering an immediate response like A&E departments are seeing an increase in demand. This pressure is being felt across the UK. The latest figures show performance against the four- hour target is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland’s figures are slightly better but they only go UP are slightly better but they only go up to September. There is still plenty of winter to come. Six hospitals have declared major incidents but they will not be the only ones struggling. That’s right. If you look at the figures in detail, a lot of hospitals are performing well below that 95% threshold we discussed. Some are so far below you cannot help but suspect that although they haven’t formally declared a major incident, thatis formally declared a major incident, that is the reality of their situation. A lot of the problems seem to because by people going to A&E when they simply do not need to be there. We have heard complaints that as many as 30% of people turning up at A&E need to be there. What we have with this system is something people evidently trust, they feel they will be seen more quickly and they are voting with their feet. Our assistant political editor Norman Smith is in Westminster. The NHS will be a key issue for the election and these figures are all quit for the government. The timing could hardly be worse. It is 21+ hours after Ed Miliband’s election campaign launch was centred on the NHS, warning it would be unrecognisable after another five unrecognisa ble after another five years of unrecognisable after another five years of the Tories. It matters because the NHS is one of the few issues that has cut through with voters. It matters to us, our parents, ourfamilies. It is as close as we get to a national religion, as Nigel Lawson said. I thinkjeremy Hunt was taken aback by some individual stories I put to him. One man in Portsmouth cited his 81-year-old mother who had been left lying 81 -- 11 81-year-old mother who had been left lying 81 --11 hours overnight waiting for an ambulance. This is despite the fact that his sister is a nurse and had been on the phone for times to get an ambulance out. It is completely unacceptable and I don’t seek to defend that at all. That is not what the NHS is about. All I would say is under these exceptional pressures, he should be assured that we do have a winter plan in that area. The government has put in more money and preparations for this winter than ever before. We want to do everything we can to get the NHS through this difficult period. In many of the e-mails we’ve had, people have had quite a good experience. The real difficulty to me seems to be that the ministers insist there is no crisis. But for families who have been affected, it certainly is a crisis. And there are more details about the pressures on the NHS on the BBC news website, where you can also put in your postcode to see how your local hospital is performing. That’s at bbc.co.uk/health. The number of people buying their first home in 2011+ rose to its highest level in seven years, according to one of the UK’s largest lenders. The Halifax estimates that there were 326,000 first-time buyers last year - a rise of 22% compared to the year before. Our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz reports. In the panic of the financial crisis, first-time buyers became the unseen losers. They couldn’t get a mortgage. Now, they are back, in places where prices dropped sharply, like Northern Ireland. Yeah, the typical first-time purchase is around £100,000. This time last year our property was 120. We were able to get it forjust over 55. In north London, that first home is still a distant prospect the most. The average first-time buyer paid £600,000 year. You tend to find that first-time buyer is typically a bit older than elsewhere. That type of buyer is someone who perhaps works in the city, coupled with an element of help from parents. Wherever you are, it is the increase in the number ofjobs available that has put more first-time buyers in a position where they can at least make an offer. And while the housing market as a whole has slightly come off the boil in recent months, particularly in London, the first-time buyer part of it has been relatively strong. One reason is the government’s helped to buy scheme, which has eased 70,000 into buying. Crucially, mortgage rates are at record lows. The lowest rates are still those with big deposits, but it has permeated through, so even first-time buyers with relatively small deposits are feeling the benefits of more competitive rates. First-time buyers have to put down £29,000 on average as a deposit. That is a big stretch, but hundreds of thousands are finding the money. Scotland Yard have dropped an investigation into a rape allegation against the Conservative MP Mark Pritchard. The MP for The Wrekin in Shropshire was arrested last month and had been on bail pending further inquiries. Our political correspondent Carole Walker is in Westminster. He has been on police bail since he was arrested back on December the 2nd after that allegation of rape. When he went back to the police station this morning he was informed there would be no further action taken as there was insufficient evidence. Pretty swiftly after that, he appeared outside the House of Commons, clearly a relieved man. he appeared outside the House of Commons, clearlya relieved man. He said he was glad it was over, you had been falsely accused, but he went on to say he believed the law on the anonymity of people facing such allegations should be changed. Sadly, as an MP, sometimes you have a target on your back. Of course, she remains anonymous, the law on anonymity does need to be reviewed and fairness does need to play a greater part in these cases. At the moment, anyone who is an allegedly victim of a sexual attack is protected by anonymity and keeps that protection even if the case is dropped, where is someone who is facing accusations has no such right to privacy, even if the case is dropped. That is what Mark Pritchard like to change. Here’s been a leading Eurosceptic, a high profile MP. He said he was now going to focus on serving his constituents and, I’m sure, it campaigning to keep his seat at the general election. Nine days after an Air Asia flight crashed in the java Sea, the search area has been expanded as teams hunt for the aircraft’s black box flight recorder. Officials believe they may have located the plane’s tail section and parts of the fuselage, but strong currents and high winds are making it hard to investigate. 162 passengers and crew were killed in the accident. Nine days later, only 37 bodies have been recovered. Mike Wooldridge has the latest. Debris recovered from the ill-fated Air Asia flight, as the search continues in the java Sea for more. Indonesian search teams brought ashore these seats and other items of wreckage from the aircraft. The teams have also been able to take advantage of a respite in the foul weather that had hampered the search operation. Strong currents, silt and mud had prevented divers reaching large objects which could be part of the fusilade, and high waves prevented the use of specialist equipment to locate the black boxes, the voice data recorders which should have 20 days of battery life left. Now, they’ve expanded the search area. The head of the search and rescue agency says that in the second priority area and with the improved weather, they will focus on finding the fuselage and other parts of the plane, especially the black boxes. With 37 bodies now recovered from the crash, Muslim religious leaders have been taken to the search area to pray for the victims. They recited verses from the Koran and made a ritual offering of rice to those who died. Nine days after the crash, the waters below still holding most of the clues to what caused the plane to go down. The American lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who is accused of having sex with an underage girl in the case that also involves Prince Andrew, has begun legal action to clear his name. Both men strenuously deny the allegations. Our royal correspondent Peter Hunt is here. What’s Alan Dershowitz saying in the court papers? He has provided his papers. He asked the court to remove his name is and allegations in the original documents and has provided a sworn statement in which he denies the accusations. He said they had been provided as quotable tabloid fodder. Turning to his accuser, he talks about her at a lack of credibility. These documents do not mention Prince Andrew, but obviously Prince Andrew is not harmed by someone questioning the credibility of the person making these allegations.

More people than ever will be living with cancer this year- that’s the prediction from the charity Macmillan Cancer. They say 2.5 million people will be coping with the effects of the disease. Researchers say the rise is down to improved treatments, but they warn that many people are left with long-term side effects. Our health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson reports. For more and FOI’ ITIOFE and ITIOFE visits to screen and treat cancer are a part of life. Even after the main treatment, many people will continue to need medical support for side effects. That is what it has been like for Nicola, who was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago. There was always a tension to say, what is going to happen next? What should I be looking out for? Especially someone like myself, where it has gone to different parts of the body. What signs, and how quickly should I be warning and talking to my GP and going on to my GP and going the past few years have seen a dramatic rise in the number of people living with and beyond a cancer diagnosis. This year there will be a record 2.5 million people according to a study by the charity Macmillan Cancer. It is a huge increase, almost half a million people more over the past five years. Researchers say it is due to an ageing population and better survival rates, but they warn it is putting the NHS under pressure. With an ever-increasing number of people living with cancer, predicted to get a 1+ million x 2030, the NHS will struggle to deliver the best outcomes, the best treatment. They are calling for cancer care to be prioritised in the run-up to the election, to ensure patients get the best chance of surviving the disease. With me now is Professor Karol Sikora - oncologist and dean of the University of Buckingham’s medical school. Extraordinary, the figures. Half a million more people living with cancer than five years ago, the charity says it’swonderful that so many people are surviving but it is a double-edged sword. It is, it it consumes health care resources. We have seen the problems of the NHS today and it’s going to get worse as the years go by. It is great, because it means people are living longer. Babies and adolescents get cancer, but it is rare. It is mainly a disease of people over 50. The more people we have over 50, and especially over 100, which is really coming now, half a million people over 100 x 2060, so today’s medical students will live through a different health care environment. One thing they pick up one is the side-effects of the treatment. One in four survivors Pace Bill faces to a health or disability. -- in four survivors Pace Bill faces to a health or disability. -- faces poor health support. Quite often patients have the treatment, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and then they feel dumped. They come back every six months, maybe have a scan, but they don’t feel scared for -- cared for. McMillan have tried to pioneer ways of making people, dubbing them support and dealing with the symptoms of long-term side-effects. What kind of side effects are having to live with? Some of the worst are drugs for colon cancer, you get nerve problems, bowel problems and it never recovers, it goes on for years. People learn how to deal with it and they can be helped, there are specialists but not enough to deal with the side-effects. Putting all the priority on upfront treatment as rapidly as possible. But living with cancer is a long-term commitment. Fortunately, many survive extremely well. The figure of 2.5 million people includes. well. The figure of 2.5 million people includes people who have been given the all clear, but even for them, there is the psychological strain you have to live with afterwards. Living with cancer, the difficulty and the uncertainty. You are confronted with your own mortality, in many cases for four Bill the first time. Now you know you are not going to live forever and you have to think about it. -- in many cases for the first time. Daughters are getting married, will you see the wedding? These are the uncertainties cancer patients suffer. McMillan have challenged politicians today to invest more in long-term cancer care. Thank you very much. The controversial Fifa president Sepp Blatter is to face a fresh challenge for his job in elections to be held in May. A Fifa vice president, Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, says he’ll try to oust the head of football’s world governing body. The jordanian royal said it was time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport. The England cricket team are flying out to play a one-day international series against Australia and India. It’s a vital warm up to next month’s World Cup. It’s the first series in which Eoin Morgan is replacing Alastair Cook as the one-day captain. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson is at Heathrow and watched the team leave. England congregated at their Heathrow hotel and will fly out to Australia to continue preparations for the World Cup getting on Valentine’s Day. Inevitably today we were thinking of the man who isn’t here. After months of planning for this World Cup, at the last minute England axed their captain Alastair Cook. The new Captain Eoin Morgan is already in Australia so he has no -- had no chance to talk strategy with coach Peter Moores. Among the England team, some matchwinners, but there is a general perception that in this form of the game, England lagged behind, it is almost like they are playing skiffle while the rest of the world has moved on to rock and roll. The coach was on positive form today and he says he really believes that for the first time England can win the 50 over World Cup. If we start to put those individual performances together, the team performance, we can beat anybody. That is part of the beauty of the World Cup, the way it is set up. Any tournament, you get on a roll and play well, you can do very well. We have seen that in the past, notjust with England in well. We have seen that in the past, not just with England in the Twenty20, we have seen other sides, India, they have got on a roll and won the tournament. If England are going to win the World Cup, during the tournament they will have to win a minimum of seven matches. In the past 12 months, in 50 over cricket, England won just past 12 months, in 50 over cricket, England wonjust nine games. Some good individuals but the captain who has held together the spirit, Alistair Cook, is not going. The dramatic moment when a factory producing fireworks went up in flames in Colombia has been captured on camera. It took a team of 30 firefighters six hours to contain the blaze and bring the accidental fireworks display to a halt. Sarah Corker reports. It was an unexpected and a little late New Year’s fireworks display. EXPLOSION The moment this factory burst into flames was captured by a local cameraman thrown back several feet by the blast. And the cascade of explosions went on and on in the small Colombian town of Granada. TRANSLATION: It was terrible. It was chaotic. We felt the vibrations. Ijust took my daughters out of the house and ran. It took 30 firefighters more than six hours to get the fire under control and make sure the remaining gunpowder wasn’t set off. TRANSLATION: 17 homes were affected. Windows, rooves and some of the walls. Despite the intensity of the blast, there was only one report of a minor injury caused by flying debris. Some living nearby, though, said they had warned the authorities the factory was dangerous. It’s now little more than a pile of rubble. And an investigation is under way into what caused this spectacular explosion. The blast-off has been postponed for a space mission designed to test what’s been billed as the world’s first reusable rocket. Countdown at the launchpad in Florida was aborted with only minutes to go. The commercial firm SpaceX intended to land a used rocket booster on a barge floating in the Atlantic. It would have been the first time such a manoeuvre had ever been carried out. The company will now try for a launch on Friday. Driverless cars, drones and health trackers for your dog - they’re just some of the products that have been put on display in Las Vegas by the world’s most influential electronics firms. They’re hoping their latest gadgets will revolutionise our lives. Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-jones has been taking a look. It’s the city of hype, where they will tell you everything, including the new High Roller big wheel, is the best there has ever been. This week technology firms have arrived in Las Vegas much the same message about their new gadgets. At this preview event, before the vast Consumer Electronic Show opens its doors, one trend stood out. Wearable technology’s been the next big thing for a while, but smartwatches that need charging every night, fitness trackers that don’t really track you that effectively and smart glasses that make you look, well, daft have made it pretty slow to take off. Perhaps this year it will be different. The clever thing about this smartwatch is that the only thing it shows you is your progress towards a daily fitness goal and its battery lasts for eight months. You want to put your two fingers on top of that. Then there are all the devices that monitor your health. This one measures your body fat. 21+% body fat, is that good or bad? That’s pretty good. I’m a healthy enough guy? You’re gonna live. And everything in your home is now going to be connected to the internet and controlled remotely. I have now found an intelligent plant and intelligent plant box. What’s smart about it? This is from a French company. This is a robotic plant and pot. So it’s full of sensors, like the drones we do. It senses the moisturiser, the fertiliser, the sunlight and it has plenty of water in the reservoir, so when you leave your house for vacation it will take care of the plants. Plenty of robots will be on show this week. These tiny ones have an educational mission. The first thing it can do is it can follow lines and patterns. It changes colours as it sees a different colour. The main appeal is that it’s tiny and can go anywhere and it can teach kids programming and logical reasoning, all in a very fun way, so they don’t even realise they’re learning. But nobody can escape from wearable technology. This is an on-collar device for pets. It works on dogs and cats. It tracks their GPS location, their activity levels and introduced this week the product tracks the ambient temperature, so you can tell if your pet is too hot or too cold. From the location of the family pet to the state of the pot plant, we’re all going to have a lot more information at our fingertips from now on. Bernard jordan, the World War II veteran who disappeared from his nursing home in Hove to attend D-Day commemorations in France last year, has died. He sparked a police search when he left his home unannounced wearing his war medals to join veterans. He will be much missed by his beloved wife and his friends. We started on a grey note but we are seeing more sunshine. The weather front is moving south, so the rain is clearing away with brighter skies starting to develop. The satellite picture shows the line of cloud affecting south-east England, with broken cloud following behind. A few showers across western areas this afternoon. Still the potential for showers afternoon. Still the potential for showers across Scotland falling as snow across the Scottish mountains, but in between, some brighter spells. Much of the afternoon will be dry with bright spells for Northern Ireland. Sunshine across England and Wales, temperatures of 7-8, brighter skies towards the Isle of Wight. The south-east corner, with a weather front lingering, that stays fairly overcast this afternoon, with the last of the rain to clear away from Kent and East Anglia this evening. The skies were clear, falling temperatures at first tonight, but by the end of the night, the wind will pick up in the West. An approaching system brings more cloud and rain, temperatures climbing. A cold start to the day across eastern parts tomorrow morning. Cold but bright in the east, but fairly quickly the cloud will increase. A wet start for Northern Ireland, west of Scotland will see heavy rain. At times around 60 mph. The wet and windy weather will move south, not quite reaching the south-east, although it will be cloudy by the afternoon. Tomorrow’s temperatures, nine -11. Wednesday’s weather front is clearing away, but it looks like it has the potential on Thursday to produce a bit more rain and linger across southern counties of England. It will take its time to clear away from the south-east. To the north of that, colder and colder air, but drierand brighter conditions, although still quite breezy to the north. Highs of 5-7. By the end of the week, areas of deep low-pressure moving to the north of the UK. So there is the potential for strong winds to affect northern areas, particularly the Northern Isles and northern Scotland. One at the start of Friday followed by a second storm to the north of Scotland on Saturday. We need to keep an eye on the strength of those winds, turning much more ",,

A plant pot that can water itself - science fiction becomes science fact Tonight on BBC London. Pressure on A&E forces Croydon hospital to declare an internal major incident. And following the death of a boy during last year’s floods, a Surrey lake is to be tested for cyanide. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The head of the NHS in England says hospitals are facing the highest ever number of ambulance calls and A&E attendances in the service’s history. And that’s combining with the worst recorded waiting times in A&E for ten years. The Government target is that 95% of patients should be treated in A&E within four hours. Infact, 92.6% were in the three months between October and December. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are missing their targets too. NHS Trusts in eight counties have been forced to declare major incidents, cancelling non-emergency work and calling in extra staff to cope with the surge of patients. One of the hospitals affected is Scarborough Hospital in North Yorkshire. Our correspondent Dominic Hughes is there for us now. How are coping there? Well, after experiencing what they described as unprecedented demand at their accident and emergency department at Scarborough Hospital, managers declared and -- Scarborough Hospital, managers declared and -- a major incident, meaning that operations were cancelled and extra staff were called in to help in A&E. That does seem to have helped as the major incident has been scaled down, but it has been far from an isolated example. Serious pressure is growing across the health service. More patients, older patients, sick patients and not enough staff to cope. A perfect storm in the accident and emergency department at Scarborough Hospital. We do the best we can in difficult circumstances, but people are queueing to get into the hospital and it can be difficult at particular times of the day. You can see people queueing to get through, and that’s before they have even gone round the corner into the department. Significant pressure in the system. Management declared a major incident, cancelling planned operations, calling in extra staff to help in A&E and asking the public to stay away unless absolutely necessary. But for some, like mother Mary Ireland, whose son has a suspected broken finger, there is no alternative so theyjust have to wait. It’svery busy. Nurses and doctors running about. Lots of people. The problems seen in Scarborough over the last 24 hours is far from unique. A number of other night Bill NHS trusts have declared major incidents as accident and emergency departments come under increasing pressure. At least nine hospitals have declared major incidents, with pressure building. In fair in Portsmouth, one elderly patient had to wait for ten hours for aid ambulance. There have been ambulances parked outside forfive hours with patients inside being treated by paramedics in the ambulance, also I believe with nursing staff. Couldn’t even get in the A&E department. A&E waiting times in England are roughly on a par with Scotland, but they are boasting evidently better than in Wales and Northern Ireland, which hasjust over 80% of Wales and Northern Ireland, which has just over 80% of people seen within four hours. Winter always brings extra pressure to emergency departments, but there’s a warning of tough times ahead. In the next few weeks, I anticipate it will be difficult and there will be further cancellations to surgery and outpatient activity to free up doctors to work in hospital. But I think we need to be open and honest with patients, and explain that. If we do that, generally patients are understanding. Across the UK, A&E departments are feeling the winter pressure. So why is A&E in England so overstretched? Why are so many more people turning up at hospital and what can be done to bring waiting times down? Our health correspondent Branwen jeffreys sent this report from Wolverhampton. Another patient arrives at New Cross Hospital A&E. Another patient arrives at New Cross HospitalA&E. By late Another patient arrives at New Cross Hospital A&E. By late morning, HospitalA&E. By late morning, every single cubicle is full and the corridor is being stacked up with trolleys. Among the patients waiting, Ricky, who has been brought in by ambulance after a severe allergic reaction. He knows he might be waiting for hours. They are really busy, they are really overworked. Lots of pressure on them. You can look down the corridor. It’sso busy. So why are some hospitals struggling? The one-on-one line sends people straight to hospital. Some patients can’t get a GP appointment quickly. Others see A&E as quick and reliable. What we have seen over the Christmas period has been quite a change in societal behaviour, how they want to use the health service. We have a Right now society, who expect things to happen immediately. Therefore, those services that offer a quick response, 999,100 and, A&E departments, are seeing an increase in demand for the service. The Chief Executive in Southampton says it is adding up to an unbearable pressure on his staff, as they try to manage patients daily on trolleys in the corridor. We are concerned that sooner or later someone will make a poor clinical decision and a patient will be placed in the corridor that shouldn’t have been, and they will die. That is my concern for the staff. For staff nurses like Sarah, it is one exhausting shift after another. However hard they work in A&E, they cannot meet the our target if are no beds available to admits patients. -- if are no beds available to admits patients. -- four our target. We can deal with them and get them through but there is no Bill nowhere to put them. The volume is too much. -- there is nowhere to put them. Many councils have cut back. Across the UK, there are similar pressures. In Wales and Northern Ireland, more patients wait longer in A&E. We don’t have the latest figures for Scotland. Everywhere is coping with rising demands. So it’snotjust about managing the numbers turning UP about managing the numbers turning up to A&E, but getting people out of hospital beds and home that’s the key to managing unprecedented demands across the NHS. The government has acknowledged that waiting time figures are very disappointing. Labour blames ministers’ reorganisation of the health service. Both sides gave their reaction shortly after the figures were announced. It’s important to have perspective. Nine out of ten people are being seen and treated within four hours in English A&Es. That’s better performance than anywhere else in the UK and it’s better performance than anywhere else in the world that measures A&E performance. These figures are extremely serious. They’re the worst figures since records began and it shows our National Health Service today is under extreme pressure all around the country. Our deputy political editor james Landale is at Westminster. james, the NHS, obviouslya key political issue for the parties. A certain amount of blaming each other today, but people will want to know, can be fixed this problem? So for the debate has focused on money. The government spent an extra £700 million this winter and is promising and other £2 billion next winter or more doctors and out of hospital care. Laboursay more doctors and out of hospital care. Labour say that if elected they would spend £2.5 billion extra on NHS staff and fast access to GPs. The Lib Dems say, well, if they are part of the next coalition, they would insure that the NHS gets an extra £8 billion per year that NHS England says it needs by 2020. The problem is, first, all sides accept it is notjust about money, there are wider issues at play. Ageing population, new treatment, the role of mental health, things like that. The second problem, this debate has been clouded by politics. Labour say the Conservatives are to blame for the extra pressure in A&E because of unnecessary reorganisation of the NHS and underfunding of social care. The Tories say this is wrong and that the pressure is UK wide. Outside England, where the Tories are not in charge, they say the record is worse. So what you have is a big, long-term issue is seen through the short-term prism of an election campaign. Expect some heat but not much light. Thank you. And there are more details about the pressures on the NHS on the BBC News website. You can also put in your postcode to see how your local hospital is performing. That’s at bbc.co.uk/health. The number of people getting onto the property ladder for the first time in 2014 rose to its highest level in seven years, according to one of the UK’s largest lenders. The Halifax estimates that there were just over 326,000 first time buyers last year - 22% more than the year before. Our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz looks at what’s behind the rise. First-time buyers are the prop which holds up the housing market. For nearly seven years, they’ve been all but missing. Now they’re back. Lenders are lending and where prices are lowest, Northern Ireland for instance, more can reach the bottom rung of the ladder. A typical first purchase here, around £100,000. This time last year, when we were looking at our own property, it was 120. With the property falling, we were able to get it forjust over 55. It is difficult. I feel sorry for the young ones. It’s a struggle to get the money together for the deposit for them, and the first few years is always hard when you are buying a home. Rachel in Nottingham, where first-time buyers pay £130,000 on average, is one of those struggling. But she and her partner are living with parents to make sure they save enough to buy as well. It has been a big sacrifice. There was a big lifestyle sacrifice. We both like going out, going out with our friends and spending time with them. We have really cut back these last few months. It’s only going to get tighter as the year goes on. Even at the top end, Camden in London, there are first-time buyers paying typical entry-level cost - £600,000. Wherever you are, it’s the increase in the number ofjobs available that has put more first-time buyers in the position where they can at least make an offer. While the housing market as a whole has slightly come off the boil in recent months, particularly in London, the first-time buyer part of it has been relatively strong. And there’s government help with deposits through Help To Buy - recognition that the housing market can’t work well without people taking that first step. Let’s look at some of the other stories making the news. Police have dropped an investigation into allegations of rape made against the Conservative MP Mark Pritchard because of a lack of evidence. The MP for the Wrekin in Shropshire is now calling for people who are accused of rape to be granted anonymity. He was arrested last month but never charged.

Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein ofjordan, who’s currently a Fifa vice president, has announced he’ll run against Mr Blatter in May. There’s been further volatility on the world’s financial markets, driven by fears about the strength of the global economy, the falling price of oil and political uncertainty in Greece. Potholes are the bane of drivers’ lives up and down the country. Now a study has found that some councils in England are facing a huge backlog of road repairs and critics say government funding falls far short. That is despite a pledge of billions of pounds to repair them. Danny Savage has been out on the road in Leeds, the council facing the biggest bill with up to £100 million worth of repairs. In some parts of Leeds, the roads are bone shaking patchwork of building potholes. In places, they are mass, in varying states of disrepair. Most of the main roads in the city are fine, but it is the labyrinth of side roads where you find most of the problems. Such as this one in Headingley, where even the 19th century cobbles have been left exposed. At this carrot in the city, repairs to cars damaged by bad road surfaces are common. -- city, repairs to cars damaged by bad road surfaces are common. -- this garage. It is a really bad problem. The feeling is it has got worse in recent years. In the past five years, we have seen a decrease in the quality of the roads. I felt it myself, various different roads, not even rural locations, some huge potholes around. A succession of severe cold and wet winters has left councils playing catch-up with road maintenance. In Leeds, the backlog of repairs is set to cost between £90 and 100 million. In the county of Gloucestershire, the bill is £86 million. In old town, they have to spend £6 million. -- million.

The government says the promised money will fix around 18 million potholes across England, but it is up to local councils to manage and properly maintain roads they are responsible for.

No-one knows the exact number, but it will be in the thousands. Each one can, of course, cause immense personal tragedy. Two years ago, we reported on what happened when one of those shells hit the home of four-year-old Amar Oadour. She was badly burned - along with some of her family - but they made it to safety and medical treatment injordan. Our correspondent, Caroline Hawley, has been back to see her. Her report contains images you may find distressing. Amar is one of thousands of children injured in Syria’s war and she’ll bear the scars for the rest of her life. just being able to play like this is a breakthrough. Until recently, she and her little sister, Rahaf, were too self-conscious even to go out of the house. This was Amar two years and several operations ago. Her hands were so damaged she couldn’t eat without help. She was so upset by her appearance, she refused to look at herself in the mirror. Now, Amar and Rahaf can use their hands to draw and to learn to write. Amar is happy to be at home. She says it’s much better than being in hospital. TRANSLATION: Here I can go down to the street and play with my friends. We play catch. I am very fast. She and Rahaf can also feed themselves now. Since we first met them, they’ve moved to their own rented home, north of Amman. But they’re still living on handouts. Their lives ruled by hospital appointments. TRANSLATION: Psychologically, they are better. There’s a long way to go, and I want them to be like they were before but now, if they see people, they no longer run away and hide. After so much surgery, Amar’s face now has to be left to heal, but she has to wear a special silicon pressure mask for as many hours a day as she can bear. Her father struggles with the trauma he has to put her through. For her sister, Rahaf, there’s yet another operation. Her father, as ever, by her side. This doctor has operated on Rahaf, Amar and their father. Today, he’s preparing Rahaf’s face for a skin graft. The MSF team here are now doing over Ao operations every week. Both Rahaf and Amar will need more surgery. I hope the doctor will do his best and they will get the best result. Up to now we don’t achieve the maximum result that we would want, but we have to continue. While Rahaf’s in the recovery room, her father tells me it’s impossible to describe how it feels to see your children suffer. TRANSLATION: Their future might be difficult, especially as girls. When they grow up, they will feel different from other girls, but I thank God they’re being treated here. There are lots of Syrians who need treatment and can’t get it. And he prays quietly for Rahaf’s recovery and for all suffering without help. Caroline Hawley, BBC News, Amman. Caroline Hawley there on the story ofjust one family affected by the bombings in Syria. An American lawyer, who is accused of having sex with an underage girl in the same case that has also implicated Prince Andrew, has begun legal action to clear his name. Alan Dershowitz has strenuously denied the claims, as has Prince Andrew. Our Royal correspondent, Peter Hunt, is at Buckingham Palace. Peter, what more can you tell us? Well, Alan Dershowitz is a famous American law. He asked the court to remove from their records his name and the allegations against him. He provided them with a sworn statement? Which denies the claims. He said the allegations have been provided as quotable fodder. They have created a media fire storm. The woman isn’t named any court papers. She is Virgina Roberts. Alan Dershowitz alleges she is a serial liar who as a utter lack of credibility and she has made lies against many world leaders. Prince Andrew isn’t mentioned in the Alan Dershowitz papers. He benefits from any questioning of Mrs Roberts credibility. There is little prospect of Prince Andrew following the example of the lawyer and providing the American court with a sworn statement in which the Prince would, once again, deny the claim that he had sex with Mrs Roberts when she was under age. In the past she has said she will not be bullied back into silence. In the past hour, her lawyers have said that she has been viciously attacked by Mr Dershowitz.

The Hoegh Osaka was deliberately run aground off the Isle of Wight on Saturday after it began developing problems. There are around 1,400 cars on board, as well as heavy construction equipment. A self-parking car, a plant pot that knows when it needs watering and a tracker for your pet - just some of the highlights of the world’s biggest gadget show in Las Vegas. Our technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-jones, been to meet the inventors turning science fiction into science fact. In Las Vegas this week a vision of a future that’s nearer than you might think. Infact, right now, cars which allow you to take your hands off the wheel and relax in heavy traffic are coming on the market. So with this system, a lot of the time you can take your hands off the wheel, but you’ve got to be ready to act if something happens. This is more futuristic, tap a smart watch and tell your car to go and find a space in the car park. I could simply get out and let the car do the work, but I’ve stayed to admire it’s driving skills. BMW says this system could be common within the next ten years. Well, the car actually seemed a bit better at parking than I am. But these are the vehicles really making a noise at the Consumer Electronics Show. Drones, armed with cameras, are coming down in price. That’s meant thousands of amateur pilots are taking to the skies. We’ve had to come miles outside Las Vegas to film this and that’s because, over the last year, the rules and regulations governing drones have grown a lot tighter, both in the United States and around the world. As the drones begin to fill our skies, there’s growing concern about the threat to our safety and our privacy. It’s the sort of Wild West again. Everyone is flexing and pushing boundaries as much as possible. Of course, I think, the people who want to use them commercially just ca n’t wait. Back in town, the big trend at the show is connecting everything to the internet, from a host of smart watches and fitness bands, to a connected dog collar, to check on your pet’s exercise regime. There’s even a smart plant pot. This is a robotic plant pot so it has censors and it has plenty of water in the reservoir. So when you leave your house for vacation it will take care of the plants for you. From the state of the pot plant, to the location of the family pet, we’re all going to have a lot more information at our finger tips from now on. Rory Cellan-jones, BBC News, Las Vegas. They were first genetically engineered and bred by the Nazis in the 1920s, a throwback to the wild bulls of German folklore. The Heck cow was renowned for its fearsome horns and aggressive nature. Now, a Devon farmer - the only one in the UK to own the breed - has been forced to put down half his herd after they repeatedly tried to attack his farmworkers. Our correspondent, jon Kay, has the story. Come on. He doesn’t want to get too close any more. Derek Gow thought so-called Nazi cattle would make an interesting addition to the rare breeds on his Devon farm. With their long horns and shaggy coats, they are impressive beasts, but Derek didn’t realise just how ferocious they would be. If I was standing here, and some of the more aggressive ones were in this field, and they could see me, then they would come right across now and try and kill you. That’s how aggressive they were. Try and kill you ? Oh, absolutely. Yes. I mean, they had every intention of wiping you from the face of this earth. Fearing for his life, Derek said he had no choice but to destroy 20 of the most aggressive cattle, leaving him with just six rather more docile beasts. Maybe Derek shouldn’t have been surprised. The Heck cattle were deliberately created by Nazi genetics experts. Keen huntsmen, Hermann Goring here, wanted an iconic and impressive breed which could roam freely across Europe, like the aurochs of old. The idea of Greek heroes, like Hercules wrestling aurochs, is written large in classical mythology and the Nazis wanted a part of that. You know, they wanted the Nazi supermen to be able to sort of, you know, better themselves against these kind of creatures in a, sort of, post-war Germany. Come on! Derek Gow says he’s feeling a lot safer now he’s got rid of the more dangerous members of the herd. His Nazi cows are the only ones in the UK. If you’re wondering what happened to the aggressive cattle that had to be destroyed, the answer is burgers and sausages. jon Kay BBC News, Devon. Time for a look at the weather, here’s Alex Deakin.

Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Victoria Hollins. Hospitals around the capital are getting so busy that some patients are having to wait up to ten hours to be seen at Accident and Emergency. NHS Figures reveal that some London hospital trusts are among the worst in the country in meeting the target four hour waiting time. The situation in some units has got so bad that they have been forced to bring in extra staff and cancel routine operations. The Prime Minister has told BBC London that he’ll work to improve the struggling NHS trusts. Nick Beake is at Croydon University Hospital which has today reached a critical point. Victoria, an ambulance arriving here today, things got so bad in the early hours this morning, it has declared a major incident, one source as saying it was all hands to the pump.

The Syrian family, bombed out of their home two years ago - we report on the specialist medical help they’ve received. The Mayor of London says that homeowners in southern England will be mugged to pay for Labour’s health plans in Scotland. And, the D-Day veteran who made one last visit to Normandy has died. Later on BBC London - pressure on A&E forces Croydon Hospital to declare an internal major incident. And, the Scottish Labour leader claims the proposed mansion tax will pay for more nurses north of the border. Good evening. There’s more evidence of pressure on accident and emergency units in England. New figures have revealed the worst waiting times since current records began a decade ago. The Government target is that 95% of patients should be treated in A&E within four hours. Between october and December, the figure was 92.6%. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also missed their respective targets. NHS Trusts in nine areas in England have declared major incidents cancelling non-emergency work and calling in extra staff. One of the latest to be affected is Scarborough Hospital, in North Yorkshire, as our health correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. More patients, older patients, sicker patients, and not enough staff to cope, factors that have created a perfect storm in the Accident & Emergency department at Scarborough Hospital. We try and do the best we can, in difficult circumstantial, but the reality is that people are queueing to get into the hospital and it can be very difficult at particular times of the day. You can see people queueing now to get through. That’s before they’ve even gone round the corner into the department. So there is a significant amount of pressure in the system. Management declared a major incident here, cancelling planned operations, calling in extra staff to help out in A&E and asking the public to stay away unless absolutely necessary. But for some, like mum Mary Ireland, whose son has a suspected broken finger, there is simply no alternative, so theyjust have to wait. Very busy. Nurses running about and doctors running about. Lots of poorly people, isn’t there, babe? Hey? The problem seen here in Scarborough, over the last 2lI-hours, are far from unique, a number of other NHS Trusts in England have also declared major incidents as their Accident & Emergency departments have come under increasing pressure. At least nine hospitals have declared major incidents, with pressure building across the system. In Portsmouth, 81-year-old Florence Cunningham waited more than 10-hours for an ambulance. Her son says crews were held up at the local A&E. There had been ambulances parked outside for five-hours with their patients inside, who were being treated by paramedics, in the ambulances, also with, I believe, nursing staff. So they couldn’t even get into the A&E department. A&E waiting times in England are roughly on a par with those in Scotland, were just over 93% of patients were seen within four-hours in September. That’s below the Scottish target of 98%. But they were both significantly better than Wales and the worst performing nation, Northern Ireland, were just over 80% of patients were seen within the four-hour target time. All of Northern Ireland’s five health trusts have now cancelled some planned surgery to tackle increased demand. Winter always brings extra pressure to emergency departments, but the Health Secretary says the NHS in England is holding up. It’s important to have perspective. Nine out of ten people are being seen and treated within the four hours at English A&E’s. That is better performance than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. It’s a better performance than anyone where else in the world that measures its A&E performance. But at Scarborough, they see tough times ahead. In the next few weeks it will be difficult. I do anticipate further cancellations of elective surgery. Further cancellations of outpatient activity to free doctors up to work in hospital. But I think we need to be open and honest with our patients and explain that. Across the UK, A&E departments are feeling the winter pressure. Dominic Hughes, BBC News Scarborough. We have this report now from London. New Cross hospital is overloaded with every cubicle full of patients waiting on trollies in the corridor. They’re really waiting on trollies in the corridor. They’ re really overworked. They’re really overworked. There’s lots of pressure on. It’s so busy. The number of very elderly people puts pressure on the staff and still more patients arrive to wait in reception. Some struggle to get a GP appointment quickly. Others are sent by the 111 advice service. Many hospitals say it’s too quick to send them on to A&E. Which is now seen by many as a reliable way of being seen fast. What we have seen over it Christmas period has been quite a change in societial behaviour in how they want to use the Health Service. We have a right-now society who expect things to happen immediately and therefore the services that offer an immediate response like 999, like III and like A&E departments, are seeing an increase in demand for that service. The shifts are relentlessly busy and antisocial. It’s hard to get doctors to work here. A survey by the colleague of Emergency Medicine suggested an average of 7.6 A&E consultants for each hospital unit. They argue at least ten are needed with 16 for larger units. In winter, merge departments see more elderly people with serious problems. Cold weather and the flu take their toll. However hard the nurses work, sometimes the target is broken. This morning, there wasn’t a single free bed in the hospital for them to admit patients. The problem is, we’ve got nowhere to put people. We can deal with them in and AE and get them through, but the volume too much coming through. But it’s not about managing the numbers turning up, but getting people out of the hospital beds and home. It’s the key to managing unprecedented demand across the NHS. Labour says that’s been made much harder by cutbacks in social care spending. That is leaving record numbers of older people trapped in hospital beds. They can’t get home because the care is not there. And that means hospitals are becoming dysfunctional. An extra EAOO million has gone into the NHS in England this winter. All the parties are promising some further funding in the next Parliament, but the Liberal Democrats say they’re the only ones would close the funding gap, identified by the NHS. All parties should now follow the lead of the Liberal Democrats and set up plans about how we are going to provide the money that is needed for the NHS now and throughout the next partment too. The pressures are signs of the wider demands faced by the Health Service, as the population ages and those can only increase. Over to james Landale. We know how decisive the politics can be, do you detect any common ground? There is some. As you heard there, all parties agree there should be more money. Government’s promising another £2 billion next year and Labour are promising £2.5 billion. The Liberal Democrats are committed to an extra £8 billion by 2020. The parties also agree that money isn’t the only problem here, that there are widerfactors, of the only problem here, that there are wider factors, of ageing populations, new treatments, the way mental health is dealt with and linking health and social care. But thatis linking health and social care. But that is pretty much where the common ground ends. Labour have placed health at the heart of their campaign and they know it’s a good card for them and they accuse the Conservatives directly of being behind the situation in A&E. They say that the Conservatives shouldn’t have underfunded social care and they shouldn’t have reformed the NHS. But, the Conservatives say, no, thatis NHS. But, the Conservatives say, no, that is wrong and actually there are wider factors across the United Kingdom. For example, in parts of the country, that aren’t run by the Conservatives. Labour, tomorrow, I’m told will step up the pressure and they are writing to the Government demanding an urgent summit to agree a cross-public service solution, but the problem is this - a cross-public service solution, but the problem is this - it’s a long-term issue seen through a short-term prism, so few are expecting any agreement soon. james, thank you. More details for you about the pressures on the NHS. Look at the website. Also a section, where you can type in your postcode to see how your local hospital is performing. Scotland Yard has dropped an investigation into a rape allegation against the Conservative MP, Mark Pritchard. Police said there was insufficient evidence to take further action, after the MP was arrested last month. Mr Pritchard said it was time to review of the law on anonymity for those people accused of rape. Our political correspondent Carole Walker reports. A clearly relieved Mark Pritchard said he’d been through a testing time, since he was arrested last month over an allegation of rape which he said was concocted by his accuser. Police dropped the investigation for lack of evidence. He said he was glad it was all over, but called for a rethink of the law. Sadly, as an MP, sometimes you have a target on your back. Of course, she remains anonymous. The law on anonymity does need to be reviewed and fairness does needed to play a greater part in these cases. At the moment, alleged victims in rape cases are granted anonymity and retain that right even if the case is dropped, but those accused of sexual offences have no such rights. Another Conservative MP, Nigel Evans, who was cleared of a string of sex abuse charges in April last year, backed the call for a change in the law. He said anonymity should be granted to both the alleged victim and the accused, at least until there’s a formal charge. But opponents of change point to cases like that of the publicist Max Clifford, who was jailed for eight years for indecent assaults against girls and young women. Coverage of the case prompted more women to come forward. jill Sayward was a victim of rape who waived her right to anonymity to campaign for other victims. She believes those accused of such offences should be named. We know that many rapists don’t rape just once and more and more people feel confident to come forward when they know that somebody else has gone forward as well and itjust adds weight to their story as well as the person who’s making the accusation initially. David Cameron’s well aware of the sensitivities of this and has warned it’s something that needs very careful thought. The coalition has looked into this whole question of anonymity and decided not to change the law, but the Prime Minister’s spokesman said that position has not changed. Carroll Walker BBC News in Downing Street. South Yorkshire Police have secured £700,000 from the Home office to continue investigating the disappearance of Ben Needham. Ben was 21 months old when he went missing on a family holiday on the Greek island of Kos back in 1991. His mother has always maintained he could still be alive and has asked police to investigate a number of possible sightings. The number of people buying their first home in 2014 rose to its highest level in seven years, according to one of the UK’s largest lenders. The Halifax estimates that there were 326,000 first-time buyers last year- a rise of 22% compared to the year before. The pound has fallen to a 17-month low against the dollar amid continuing volatility on the world’s financial markets. Stock exchanges in Europe and the United States saw further falls and at one point today, the oil price dropped tojust over $51 - its lowest level for five-and-a-half years. Our Business Correspondent Michelle Fleury is in New York. What is the sentiment there? oil prices have been falling since last summer. Today, the price of US crude oilfell below summer. Today, the price of US crude oil fell below $50 for the first time in five-and-a-half years. The falling price of oil is seen as good news for the US economy, but the fall has been so steep, it has been going on for so long, that investors fear it reflects weakness in the global economy. So, on Monday, the US stock market, particularly the Dowjones Industrial saw sharp falls which continued today. To underscore this point, a report out of Britain showed that the service sector continued to slow down, not only did that knock the stuffing out of the pound, but it also served as a reminder that Britain’s recovery maybe flagging. Of course, traders aren’tjust maybe flagging. Of course, traders aren’t just worried about the UK. maybe flagging. Of course, traders aren’tjust worried about the UK. In fact, they are even more concerned about the eurozone and the impending election in Greece. US markets may have ended last year incredibly chirper, but they are very nervous at the start of 2015. Michelle, thank you very much for the update there. Michelle Fluery in New York. A group of Syrian doctors say the West is focusing too much on so-called Islamic State extremists and forgetting the suffering of ordinary Syrians. The Union of Syrian Medical Relief organisations said the situation in many areas of the country had become ""catastrophic."" Since the conflict began, countless bombs have fallen on Syrian homes. Two years ago, we reported on the plight of Amar Qadour and her family, whose home had been destroyed. They fled to neighbouring jordan to get specialist medical treatment. Our correspondent, Caroline Hawley, went back to see them. Amar is one of thousands of children injured in Syria’s war and she’ll bear the scars for the rest of her life. just being able to play like this is a breakthrough. Until recently, she and her little sister, Rahaf, were too self-conscious even to go out of the house. This was Amar two years and several operations ago. Her hands were so damaged she couldn’t eat without help. She was so upset by her appearance, she refused to look at herself in the mirror. Now, Amar and Rahaf can use their hands to draw and to learn to write. Amar is happy to be at home. She says it’s much better than being in hospital. TRANSLATION: Here I can go down to the street and play with my friends. We play catch. I am very fast. She and Rahaf can also feed themselves now. Since we first met them, they’ve moved to their own rented home, north of Amman. But they’re still living on handouts. Their lives ruled by hospital appointments. TRANSLATION: Psychologically, they are better. There’s a long way to go, and I want them to be like they were before but now, if they see people, they no longer run away and hide. After so much surgery, Amar’s face now has to be left to heal, but she has to wear a special silicon pressure mask for as many hours a day as she can bear. Her father struggles with the trauma he has to put her through. For her sister, Rahaf, there’s yet another operation. Her father, as ever, by her side. This doctor has operated on Rahaf, Amar and their father. Today, he’s preparing Rahaf’s face for a skin graft. The MSF team here are now doing over Ao operations every week. Both Rahaf and Amar will need more surgery. I hope the doctor will do his best and they will get the best result. Up to now we don’t achieve the maximum result that we would want, but we have to continue. While Rahaf’s in the recovery room, her father tells me it’s impossible to describe how it feels to see your children suffer. TRANSLATION: Their future might be difficult, especially as girls. When they grow up, they will feel different from other girls, but I thank God they’re being treated here. There are lots of Syrians who need treatment and can’t get it. And he prays quietly for Rahaf’s recovery and for all suffering without help. Caroline Hawley, BBC News, Amman. The plight of one Syrian family after their home was destroyed two years ago. In Turkey, a female suicide bomber has attacked a police station in Istanbul, killing herself and a police officer. Another officer was injured in the attack, in the heart of the city’s tourist district. The authorities say the woman went into the building and reported a missing wallet before detonating a bomb. Borisjohnson, the Mayor of London, has accused the Scottish Labour Party of planning to ""mug"" homeowners in London and the south-east of England to pay for more nurses in Scotland using proceeds from a mansion tax. Mrjohnson said thatjim Murphy, the Labour leader in Scotland, had made a ""cynical calculation"" to try to revive his party’s fortunes. As our correspondent, james Cook, reports, Mr Murphy’s reported plans have also antagonised some of his Labour colleagues at Westminster. If Labour win the general election, they plan to tax properties worth more than £2 million. For in every five of those are in London and the south-east of England. Scottish Labour say they’ll spend some of the proceeds on 1,000 extra nurses. The Mayor of London calls it a ""mugging."" They’ve decided to pun beish the south-east, or to be vindictive, fiscally vindictive, towards the south-east of England in order to try to bribe the Scots to vote Labour. -- order to try to bribe the Scots to vote Labour. -- punish. It’s not just Labour’s foes attacking the plan, the party’ses MPs in London say the capital shoulden be a cash cow. jim Murphy’sjumping the gun on the mansion tax, trying to get support in Scotland in a really unscrupulous way, by talking about a tax of which he knows nothing. Rubbish, says the leader of Scottish Labour, in Aberdeen today, this is how the union works. Part of the strength of the United Kingdom is we pull and share resources so the UK benefits from the oil and gas industry, here in Aberdeen, Scotland benefits from this new tax across the UK. Most of which will be raised in the south-east of England. That’s a fair deal. Of course, there is no direct link between a mansion tax and Scottish nurses. Scotland’s funding formula is far more complicating than that. A row with Labour in London suitsjim Murphy, as he tries to soundle like he is standing up for Scotland. That’s because the SNP is snapping at his heels. Polls suggest the nationalists could sweep Labour aside in May, taking almost all of the party’s A1 seats? Scotland. If jim Murphy was serious about supporting public services he would back the scrapping of Trident, save £100 billion, that would make a huge difference to the health service. The SNP delivered. The Labour Party is long in rhetoric they are in crisis when facing an SNP challenge in the run-up to a UK general election. The conundrum for Labour is this - election. The conundrum for Labour is this - will saving seats in Scotland cost them votes in the south-east of England? james Cook, BBC News, Glasgow.

Bernard jordan, the Second World War veteran who disappeared from his care home in Sussex to attend last year’s D-Day commemorations in Normandy, has died at the age of 90. Mrjordan made headlines around the world because of his determination to join fellow veterans at the 70th anniversary events. Our correspondent, Duncan Kennedy, has the story. This is the moment Bernard jordan was honoured for his inspirationaljourney across the Channel, given the freedom of Brighton & Hove, the starting point for his adventure, and proof that his guile and resourcefulness had not been dimmed by age. And I thought, what a marvellous country this is. It’s really 110% worth it. Bernard was 89 when he was pictured last year returning from his own individual Normandy landing. The spirited veteran had sneaked out of his nursing home after failing to get on an organised trip to the D-Day commemorations. He hid his medals under his raincoat and crossed the Channel alone, sparking a police search, all so he could join in the 70th anniversary events. My mates had been there and some of them had got killed there, I was going across to pay my respects to them. That was my object. He was also asked how he he did it? There was a bit of deception! LAUGHTER. Yeah. Tonight, an old friend paid warm tribute to the man who became known as ""the great escaper."" What a great guy, an inspiration. Maybe, some were saying, that’s how we won The Battle of Britain. People like that are hard to find and Bernie was one of the greatest. Bernard jordan’s extraordinary story brought the world’s media to his care home in Hove. Tonight, the home said he’d captured everyone’s imagination.

That’s all from us. Now, on BBC one, it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good night. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Victoria Hollins. Hospitals around the capital are getting so busy that some patients are having to wait up to 10 hours to be seen at Accident and Emergency. NHS Figures reveal that some London hospital trusts are among the worst in the country when it comes to meeting the target four hour waiting time. Today, as Croydon University Hospital was forced to declare an internal major incident, the Prime Minister told BBC London he’ll work to improve the struggling NHS trusts. Nick Beake reports. Another ambulance brings yet another patient to a London A&E already under massive strain. Kroy tonne University Hospital, the first in the capital to declare a so-called internal major incident. In other words, too many patients, not enough beds and for one woman with pneumonia, it meant a seven-hour wait. I called the ambulance about eight and they arrived within 20 minutes last night. And by the time we got here it was about 10.00am and I didn’t see a doctor until this morning. My breathing was so bad. I’m an ex-paramedic and I know what they’re going through. It was like a war zone with the amount of people. There’s not enough staff. It’s all to do with cutbacks. The Prime Minister for one would deny that, but today admitted to BBC London extra NHS winTing funding here hadn’t done the job. Croydon did get some money.

32,BBC1 London,6-jan-2015,BBC London News,22:25,10 mins,True,"we’re all going to have a lot more information at our finger tips from now on. Rory Cellan-jones, BBC News, Las Vegas. Bernard jordan, the Second World War veteran who disappeared from his care home in Sussex to attend last year’s D-Day commemorations in Normandy, has died at the age of 90. Mrjordan made headlines around the world because of his determination to join fellow veterans at the 70th anniversary events. Our correspondent, Duncan Kennedy, has the story. This is the moment Bernard jordan was honoured for his inspirationaljourney across the Channel, given the freedom of Brighton & Hove, the starting point for his adventure, and proof that his guile and resourcefulness had not been dimmed by age. And I thought, what a marvellous country this is. It’s really 110% worth it. Bernard was 89 when he was pictured last year returning from his own individual Normandy landing. The spirited veteran had sneaked out of his nursing home after failing to get on an organised trip to the D-Day commemorations. He hid his medals under his raincoat and crossed the Channel alone, sparking a police search, all so he could join in the 70th anniversary events. My mates had been there and some of them had got killed there, I was going across to pay my respects to them. That was my object. He was also asked how he he did it? There was a bit of deception! LAUGHTER. Yeah. Tonight, an old friend paid warm tribute to the man who became known as ""the great escaper."" What a great guy, an inspiration. Maybe, some were saying, that’s how we won The Battle of Britain. People like that are hard to find and Bernie was one of the greatest. Bernard jordan’s extraordinary story brought the world’s media to his care home in Hove. Tonight, the home said he’d captured everyone’s imagination. The former wartime naval officer, who took to the seas again, defying age, frailty and expectation to be with those who had served their country. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News, in Brighton. That’s all from us. Now, on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good night. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Victoria Hollins. Hospitals around the capital are getting so busy that some patients are having to wait up to 10 hours to be seen at Accident and Emergency. NHS Figures reveal that some London hospital trusts are among the worst in the country when it comes to meeting the target four hour waiting time. Today, as Croydon University Hospital was forced to declare an internal major incident, the Prime Minister told BBC London he’ll work to improve the struggling NHS trusts. Nick Beake reports. Another ambulance brings yet another patient to a London A&E already under massive strain. Kroy tonne University Hospital, the first in the capital to declare a so-called internal major incident. In other words, too many patients, not enough beds and for one woman with pneumonia, it meant a seven-hour wait. I called the ambulance about eight and they arrived within 20 minutes last night. And by the time we got here it was about 10.00am and I didn’t see a doctor until this morning. My breathing was so bad. I’m an ex-paramedic and I know what they’re going through. It was like a war zone with the amount of people. There’s not enough staff. It’s all to do with cutbacks. The Prime Minister for one would deny that, but today admitted to BBC London extra NHS winTing funding here hadn’t done the job. Croydon did get some money. We put an extra £700 million into the NHS to cope with the pressures and Croydon got £1+ .5 million, but clearly there are problems and issues. Figures for the past three months show Croydon saw only 92% of patients within four hours. Missing the 95% target. But the worst-perform is NHS trust in London was barking with just 80%. Lewisham and Greenwich only had 86% of patients being seen within the target time. This is a sign of what is happening across London and London is creeking and no-one is taking responsibility for it. NHS bosses say cash is being spent in London specifically on recruiting more A&E staff and flu jabs and/or an information campaign giving alternatives to A&E. However, in Surrey this evening, the major incident level within Ashford Hospital remains in place. So too at Luton and Dunstable. Here in Croydon, that status has been downgraded, but will remain under review. It’s worth remembering though that hospitals don’t have to announce if there’s a major incident inside and so tonight there may well be other departments facing big problems, big problems we simply don’t know about. Commuters have faced a second evening of overcrowding at London Bridge Station, which is being rebuilt for the Thameslink programme. There’ve been delays of 30 minutes tonight and cancellations and passengers struggled to get to trains. It follows problems yesterday when the station opened for the first time following the building of new platforms. Network Rail has apologised and says an urgent review is under way. The Environment Agency has been ordered to carry out tests on a lake in Surrey, close to where a seven-year-old boy died during last year’s floods. A pathologist’s report found that Zane Gbangbola had died from carbon monoxide poisoning. But Zane’s parents and local residents are worried that contaminated floodwater from a nearby lake caused his death. Alex Bushill reports. We would like Zane back. We know that can’t be done, but what can be done is to ensure that this doesn’t happen again. The words of Zane’s parents. 11 months on he feel industry indicated. The Environment Secretary has ordered tests to be carried out. Reading from a statement, this was the father’s reaction. A child should never be sackifiesed by authorities placing walls of silence and barriers to hide the truth. There remains many unanswered questions andLies Truss has recognised this. It was in january last year that he died after the family home had been flooded for weeks. A postmortem found no clear cause of death. Then injune, a pathologist’s report said he died from Co2 poisoning. His parents have a very different view and always believed that this former landfill site close to the family home is what caused the death of their son. They say during the floodwater, toxic fumes were kicked up by the flooding and that infused family home and that’s why they say they’re son died of poising, which left his father in a wheelchair. Back in june, BBC London confirmed the area behind their home had been used as landfill and according to a property search, there was potential for significant ground contamination to exist. At the time, the local authority dismissed his parents’ concerns, but accused them of spreading panic. We would really like organisations to move forward in a spirit where they are not thinking purely about reputation, but thinking about providing the answers that are needed. I have no animosity towards them. It’s about the results. The Environment Agency says that the site and the lake show no signs of environmental concern and there is no evidence to suggest a public health risk. None the less, it has confirmed it will carry out further tests on the site beginning this week. The findings will form part of the inquest into Zane’s death. That’s it from me. Now the weather. It’s a fairly clear and cooler night tonight. Temperatures staying above freezing for the most part, so most of us should escape the frost from the rural parts, where it may get down to freezing or below. Tomorrow morning, we have quite a sunny start to the day. Come the afternoon, though, we have cloud building from the west. And we’ll have a southerly breeze picking up, but fairly mild with temperatures reaching nine or ten. That patchy rain comes in overnight and continues into Thursday morning, as well. By the afternoon, it’s clearing and the winds are easing too. But with thundery showers to contend with. Friday, a few more showers around and a mild day. Infact, if you look at the outlook, you can see temperatures well up into the teens there. Good evening. There’s the potential for some very lively weather later this week. For the time being, for some very lively weather later this week. Forthe time being, it’s more typicaljanuary this week. Forthe time being, it’s more typical january weather. more typicaljanuary weather. It’s not as cloudy and as a result it’s a lot colder. Already a touch of frost in rural areas. lot colder. Already a touch of frost in ruralareas. In in rural areas. In the west, the cloud is increasing and rain is spreading to the west and temperatures will rise. Even across the east, most towns and cities will be above freezing come dawn. There will be a fair bit of sunshine across England and Wales, but it’s not the picture for Scotland and Northern Ireland. A wet and increasingly windy day, particularly so across western Scotland. Some of the rain is heading to Cumbria and Anglesey, but for most of England and Wales it should be a dry rush hour. The cloud thickening across the far south-west, but a fair bit of sunshine across the Midlands and eastern England. A bit chilly out there. Across East Anglia and the south-west, a fine winter’s day. Hanging on to sunshine throughout. Cloud increasing elsewhere. Further west, rain trickling in. And across Wales and Northern Ireland. The strongest winds in the far north where, where gusts of 60mph are possible. Testimony tus up to 10. Maybe 11 or 12 in the far west, but it won’t feel that mild because of the cold front. Behind this, wintry showers and then the front itself is reluctant to clear. A little ripple on it or the waves and they give us forecasters headaches. The question mark on Thursday is when will it clear? There will be some showers in the south and in the north. For many, it’s a bright, breezy Thursday afternoon. Temperatures in single figures. Then we look at the big picture across the Atlantic. Not one, but two potentially very in they areas of low. Developing as they approach the United Kingdom. Look at the isobars spewing out. Strong winds on Friday and then that clears away, only to be followed by another one. Following the same track between the UK and Iceland, but lots of isobars, and potential for strong winds. Not once, but twice. Northern Britain will bear the brunt. Quite a bit of uncertainty. Lots of energy in the atmosphere, but there has to be the potential for some disruption. He may not look it, but he’s brilliant. Now, let’s go and catch ourselves a killer. It was, er, murder, made to look like suicide, masquerading as murder.

Aaah! Bang! Boom! BOOM Does it make a noise at all when I hit it? Oh, what a sound effect! And then when my seat turns - skewwww! 'The Voice is back:' Good afternoon. France is on its highest state of alert as security forces hunt for accomplices of the gunmen who killed 17 people in three days of terror attacks. Among those the police are seeking is the girlfriend of Ammedy Coulibaly, who was killed after taking hostages at a Paris supermarket. They’ve described her as armed and dangerous. New details are emerging of the second siege at Dammartin where the two men who killed 12 people in Paris last week died in a shoot-out with security forces. Caroline Hawley reports. This is how it ended for the brothers who brought terror to France. New pictures have emerged of special forces moving in on the building where Kouachi brothers had been hold up. They were shot dead as they came out afprinting warehouse firing at police. It has emerged the man they were thought to be holding hostage was a graphic designer texting the police are from his hiding place under a sink. Today, his father asked for privacy. TRANSLATION: We’re doing fine. They thank the police services who did what was needed and the people who helped. It is all we can say. In Paris, this morning, tributes paid to those killed at a supermarket where another man, Ammedy Coulibaly, held hostages, hoping to use them to free the Kouachi brothers. A radio station had called his number in the middle of the siege and taped him talking to his hostages. He said he is taking revenge on Israel and on the international qltion launching airstrikes against Iraq. -- coalition launching airstrikes against Iraq. The Government says it is determined to track down everyone involved. TRANSLATION: We are, of course, determined to take all possible measures to protect the country. We are examining the information arising from our investigations into those who committed the criminal acts, but we are also looking at anyone who may have had links to them. A huge hunt is now underway for Ammedy Coulibaly’s common-law wife. She is believed to be armed. As the police continue their searchs, five people are now in custody, the prosecutor says they will be the main focus of their investigation now. Tomorrow, a huge rally is planned in Paris attended by world leaders. France says it will do everything in its power to make sure that those who take part are safe. Our correspondent Lucy Williamson is in Paris. What’s the mood like today? A different scene behind me this morning after the attacks yesterday. Neighbours, residents, and of course, the forensic teams now replacing the rows of police that ring this area last night. Speaking to one of the residents here, she said we know now that tomorrow will never be the same as yesterday. The Prime Minister has been speaking about it as well. He said that in the aftermath of the attacks, France must remain outraged, not for three days, but forever. And the focus for the Government now, of course, is on finding the one remaining suspect who is at large, the accomplice of the hostage-taker here, and that hunt is continuing as France prepares for a massive rally here tomorrow. The Conservatives say they will change the law to make it more difficult for unions to call strikes involving key public services if they win this year’s general election. They say they want to prevent unions ""holding the country to ransom"". Unions have reacted angrily to the pledge calling the move a ""democratic outrage"". Louise Stewart reports. Following the disruption caused last summer when hundreds of thousands of public sector workers took part in strike action across the UK, David Cameron said it was time to legislate. The Conservatives have already proposed a minimum 50% turnout for strike ballots to be valid. Underthe new turnout for strike ballots to be valid. Under the new plans a strike affecting those working in health, transport, Fire Services or schools would need the support of 40% of union members. A strike in the public sector affects many people who have no chance in exercise no authority over that strike whatsoever. So before it takes place, it ought to have the support of at least 40% of the members of that trade union. . The Conservatives say the new rules would mean that nearly three-quarters of significant strike ballots staged since the last election would have been invalid. Union leaders condemned the proposals as a democratic outrage. We already have one of the toughest frameworks of law on industrial action in any democratic country and this Government wants to make it impossible for workers to exercise their fundamental liberty to withdraw your labour. Labour have accused the Tories of playing political games. The Conservatives are certain to seize on any opposition from Labour to the proposals to renew their charge that Ed Miliband is too close to the trade unions. The ghost card say they believe two men who went into the sea in Brighton have died. Lifeboats searched the area, but no trace of the men was found. Tens of thousands of homes in Scotland are without power this lunch time after a powerful storm caused widespread disruption. Engineers are working to restore electricity as forecasters predict more high winds. Our Scotland correspondent, Laura Bicker, is in Glasgow. Overnight it has been windy. Sh-Shetland where they saw the worst TV, there has been a gust of 101mph and it is in that weather that engineers have been trying to restore power supply to homes without power after yesterday’s hurricane-force winds. They say over 70,000 customers have their power back, but 30,000 homes still remain without electricity this lunch time. Engineers battled through the night and they are going and there are apologies, but they will have to battle through this continuing bad weather. The next news on BBC One is at 6.10pm. Bye for now. Good afternoon. A vigorous area of low pressure is beginning to drift away from the far north of the UK. It was a mild start to the day for much of England and Wales, but this cold front has been sweeping south and cold air follows along behind and there is a lot of isobars on the charts. A blustery afternoon across all parts. Behind the cold front, some sunshine does come out for England and Wales. Further north a rash of showers coming into Northern Ireland and Scotland. They will be falling as snow to low levels. It is cold in the wind. just two or three Celsius. The showers in Northern England producing some snow. But there is a lot of dry and bright weather across England and Wales. Bright and breezy and maybe a shower or two coming in from the west. After 13 Celsius or 14 Celsius this morning, maybe only seven or eight Celsius this afternoon. We will keep it dry across the south and the east. Further north, there is more snow to come and that will be accumulating over the hills. Further west, there will be showers around and again, some of the hills in the west might see a little bit of snow oversnaout and ice, of course will be a problem particularly Northern England up into Scotland and there could be slippery surfaces to take us into Sunday morning. It will be windy again across Scotland and the north of the UK and the showers will merge into a spell of sleet and snow which will begin to thaw as the temperatures rise. Rain into Northern Ireland and the western side of England and Wales cloudy with rain. The best chance of the dry weather is across the eastern side of England. For many it is eights and nines, but a noticeable rise in the north and the west. Into the early part of the next week and the next Atlantic low comes our way, we will be talking about gales and severe gales early next week and there will be an active weather front sweeping its way south. Some rain for the rush hourin way south. Some rain for the rush hour in Glasgow and Belfast and the rain sweeps its way south through the day. It may well linger in Good afternoon.

That brings extra pressure? It brings pressure. What I want to emphasise is that the club is only won four games in 2014. Home games. Albion’s home form has been terrible. We have two sort that out. I hope and pray that when we turn up for the whole city game, the supporters recognise the part they have to play. -- city game, the supporters recognise the part they have to play. -- Hull City.

A huge hunt is under way in France for the widow of one of the gunmen shot dead by police yesterday. Police believe Hayat Boumedienne - who’s described as armed and dangerous - was involved in this week’s terror attacks. Across France, three quarters of a million people hold the jails to remember victims. The family of a Muslim policeman shot dead on Wednesdays appeal for calm. TRANSLATION: I speak now to all the racists, Islamophobic and anti-Semites. You mustn’t confuse extremists and Muslims. We’ll have all the latest from Paris. Tonight’s other main stories: The Conservatives plan new laws making it harder for public service unions to call a strike. And storms in Scotland leave tens of thousands of homes without power. Good evening. Hundreds of thousands of people have taken part in silent marches across France - in a show of defiance after three days of terror that have left 17 people dead. Meanwhile a huge hunt is underway tonight for Hayat Boumedienne - widow of the terrorist who was killed after seizing hostages at a Paris supermarket. Survivors of both yesterday’s sieges have been talking about their ordeals. And the family of a Muslim policeman - shot dead in cold blood during Wednesday’s attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine - have appealed for calm and unity. Our first report is from Damian Grammaticas in Paris. Still wary, still on guard. Across France, people have been gathering today, in their tens of thousands, from the Mediterranean to the Alps, United after the trauma of recent days. And it’s not over yet. The lease in Paris may have gunned down the attack in the supermarket siege -- police in Paris. But while Ahmed Khumalo Valley died, his wife Hayat Boumedienne escapes. You images emerged today of her training with a crossbow. She is France’s most wanted. TRANSLATION: We are not-- we’ll all war, not against a religion, but to defend our values, against terrorism, againstjihad, radical Islam. The men in both sieges were close friends. Police have released their own footage, showing how they moved in on the Kouachi brothers. Incredibly, one worker hiding under a sink in the building survived unscathed. As did the manager of the business owner whom the attackers took hostage, then released. TRANSLATION: I talked to them, I managed to stay calm. I don’t know how, I did what I did to survive. At the start of the killing spree the Kouachi brothers had shown no mercy to Ahmed Merabet, the police they executed in cold blood. His family broke their silence today. TRANSLATION: My brother was Muslim and he was killed by people who pretend to be Muslims. They are terrorists, that is it. We would like to see all the pictures. When we see my brother on the pavement, dying, being killed. And far Ahmed Merabet at the 16 others who have died there will be marches across France tomorrow. There are fears about new attacks. That is why there will also be tens of thousands of police out, guarding them. Four hostages lost their lives at the kosher supermarket in Paris yesterday. One of the survivors - an employee - has been speaking about how he hid people in a freezer, hoping the gunman wouldn’t find them. Our Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson reports. This report contains images you may find distressing. It was the moment a supermarket became a war zone. Local shoppers, held hostage inside. And then the hostagetaking himself, running straight for police lines. He doesn’t stand a chance. We heard like a bomb noise, and just after, a lot of noise of shotguns. Marilyn used this supermarket every day. The flowers and forensic teams are slowly taking over her street now, but the memory of what happened in this smalljewish community is not so easily wiped away. Usually, when I see this kosher market, I don’t feel anything and this morning I see the kosher market and in the same time I see and hear the noise of the shot gun yesterday. And I imagine the blood and also because I had a friend inside, I lost a friend yesterday in the store, at 11pm yesterday I received a text message and I said, oh, my God, oh, my God. Three other hostages died in the siege. The terror of those who survived was clear. One father hid his three-year-old son in a cold storage room to keep him alive, helped by a supermarket employee, captured along with them. TRANSLATION: They ran down into the basement. I opened the freezer door and several people came in with me, including a baby. I switched off the light and the freezer and I said, stay here, stay calm, I will go back up. One hostage describes sitting next to corpses as she waited for the siege to end. She said the gunman had shot a woman in the head after she tried to take the gun. Marilyn, a psychologist, says be attackers traumatised the Trinity. The French prime ministers said the country must remain outraged forever. One local resident said, we know that tomorrow will never be the same as yesterday. Our chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet is in Paris. Lyse, so many people taking to the streets today across France to show unity and defiance in the face of these attacks. Yes, the individual legs -- the individual stories of extraordinary courage, people literally under fire. There is a profound sense that when the very fabric of your nation and society and the life you live is under threat, that it is the people’s army which is going out onto the street. It is so precious they almost don’t want to make a sound, more than 700,000 people in cities and towns across the country marched in what were called silent vigils. Here at the Place de la Republique, one of the main gathering places in Paris, despite the cold and rain, looked behind me at this statue. The rallying cry of centuries is here, liberty, equality, people are still lighting candles, putting placards out saying I am Charlie, in to the cartoonists and journalists killed. Tomorrow, it is here in this square that a major marches to begin, they marched the Prime Minister said was an opportunity for all the people of France to show how much they love liberty. This is a country facing danger. 5500 soldiers and police will be on the streets to make sure that tomorrow it passes off peacefully. In the day’s other news, the Conservatives say they will change the law to make it more difficult for unions to call strikes involving key public services if they win this year’s general election. They say they want to prevent unions ""holding the country to ransom"". The move was denounced by the TUC as a ""democratic outrage"". Our political correspondent Chris Mason reports. Twice in the last four years, the NUT has called strikes. Further walk-outs could happen. Next week, firefighters in Essex will walk out but their strike could go ahead with these rules because plenty turned out and plenty wanted to walk out. The Conservatives say if they win the election outright, a union representing workers in health, education, transport and the fire service will have to do more than get more votes for a strike than against one. Instead, 40% of all those who could vote if they wanted to must support strike action. They also want ballots only to be valid if half or more of those with a vote actually turn out. A strike in the public sector affects many people who have no chance and exercise no authority over the strike whatsoever. The political calculation from the Conservatives is simple. They hope because people are reliant on public services, plenty will see this as a good idea. They also hope to make Labour, with its union collections, squirm. Everybody who cares about Civil Liberties and democracy and the right of ordinary working people to stand up for public services and jobs and pay should be worried about these proposals. On Tuesday, bus drivers in London are due to strike, a walk-out that would not be legal under the Conservatives’ ideas. Labour pointed out the vast majority of MPs don’t manage to get 40% of all eligible voters to support them. The Lib Dems said the plan strangled people’s basic rights. A body has been recovered from a beach near Brighton, after two men were swept out to sea in the early hours of the morning. A huge search and rescue operation was launched when one of the men was dragged into the water and his friend swam out to try to rescue him. The men - aged 23 and 24 - have been named as Dan Nicholls and Freddie Reynolds, both from Brighton. Tens of thousands of homes are still without power in Scotland after a powerful storm overnight caused widespread disruption. Engineers are working to restore electricity but are being hampered by blocked roads and more poor weather. Our Scotland correspondent Laura Bicker is in Glasgow. This has been the second storm in two days. Last night, Shetland bore the brunt. There was a gust of 101 mph on Shetland. It is having an effect on power lines. This evening, 30,000 homes are still without power, despite the best efforts of engineers and Scottish and Southern energy have conceded that parts of northern sky, Harris and Caithness will not have power until tomorrow. Those communities are facing a third day without power. They say engineers have worked in very difficult conditions, sometimes it has not been safe enough for them to work. It is notjust power affected. Rail and ferry services have also been disrupted. Network Rail fake they have removed -- been disrupted.

Kendall House in Gravesend was closed in 1986. But in recent years a BBC investigation revealed claims that teenage girls had been repeatedly drugged there. That room is where they had the medication. Teresa Cooper, now in her 40s, claims that this happened to her when she was there in her teens. She also claims she was physically and sexually abused.

Also tonight: The Conservatives plan new laws making it harder for public service unions to go on strike. And, storms in Scotland leave thousands of homes without power. Good evening. Three quarters of a million people have taken part in marches and vigils across France today in a mass show of defiance after three days of terror that left 17 people dead. Tomorrow, world leaders, including David Cameron, will gather in Paris as a gesture of solidarity. Remarkable stories have emerged about the heroism of some of the hostages in the sieges where the three terrorists died. Police are still hunting the widow of one of the gunmen - Hayat Boumeddiene - but she’s now believed to have escaped via Turkey to Syria. Our first report tonight is from Damian Grammaticas in Paris. Tonight French men and women, whatever their faith, whatever their politics gathering on the Eve of what are expected to be massive marches. All The violence has shocked France. Police released their own footage today, show ing how they moved in to end the first siege. Incredibly one worker hiding under a sink in the building survived unscathed. As to the manager of the business who had been taken hostage and then released. I talked to them. I managed to stay calm. I don’t know how, I did what I could to survive. After the attacks there is still fear. Police in We are all at war. Not against a religion, this is not a war of civilisationses, but to defend our values, a war against terrorism, againstjihad, against radical Islam. At the start of their killing spree the brothers had shown no mercy to the policeman they executed in cold blood. His family broke their silence today. My brother was Muslim. And he was killed by people who pretend to be Muslims, they are terrorists, that’s it. When we see mY terrorists, that’s it. When we see my brother on the pavement dying, being killed. There will now be marches across France tomorrow. There have been calls for millions to attend but there are also fears about new attacks and that’s why there will be tens of thousands of police out guarding them. Four hostages lost their lives at the Kosher supermarket in Paris yesterday. Tonight, they have been named, as Yohan Cohen, Francois-Michel Saada, Philippe Braham and Yoav Hattab. One of the survivors of the siege - a Muslim employee - has been speaking about how he hid some of the customers in a cold storage unit, hoping the gunman wouldn’t find them. Lucy Williamson’s report now contains images you may find distressing. It was the moment a supermarket became a war zone. Local shoppers held hostage inside. And then the hostage-taker himself, he’d run straight for police lines. He didn’t stand a chance. We heard like a bomb noise. just after, a lot of noise of shotguns. Marilyn used this supermarket every day. The flowers and forensic teams are slowly taking over her street now, but the memory of what happened in this smalljewish community isn’t so easily wiped away. Usually when I see this kosher market, I don’t feel nothing. This morning, I see the kosher market, and in the same time I see and I hear the noise of the shotgun yesterday. And I imagine the blood and also because I had a friend inside. I lost a friend yesterday in the store. At 11pm I received a text message and I said, ""Oh my God. Oh my God."" Three other hostages died in the siege. The terror of those who survived was clear. One father hid his three-year-old son in a cold storage room to keep him alive. Helped by a supermarket employee captured along with them. TRANSLATION: They ran down into the basement. I opened the freezer door. Several people came in with me, including a baby. I switched off the light and freezer. I said, stay here, stay calm, I will go back up. One hostage describes sitting next to corpses as she waited for the siege to end. She said the gunman had shot a woman in the head after she had tried to take his weapon. Marilyn, a psychologist herself, says the experience has traumatised the whole community. These attacks will haunt the community here for a long while to come. The French President said the country must remain outraged for ever. One local resident put it differently, she said, ""We know tomorrow will not be the same as yesterday."" Our chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet is in Paris. So many people So ITI8I’Iy people out OI’! So many people out on the streets of cities and towns across France today really remarkable show of defiance. It is a time of profound emotion here in France across France, people with emotion, reflection and many people fear, as well, after these three extraordinary days that people have gone through, the individual acts of courage we have been reporting on and the way in which people have come to places like this, one of the main gathering places and they come in silence to leave some flowers, to light a candle, to write something. People of all faiths and of no faiths. Really extraordinary to see today on a day when there was no public call for rallies, for marches, that three-quarters of a million people across this country came out and they’re being described as silent vigils, as if people can find no words for what’s been unspeakable violence in this country. The Prime Minister has called upon all the people of France to come out tomorrow to express their love for liberty and they do that in part because they fear that there are many still waiting, terror cells, sleeping cells, networks who lie in wait to carry out more attacks of the kind we have seen in the past three days. Thank you. In other news, the Conservatives say they will tighten the law to make it more difficult for unions to call strikes involving key public services if they win this year’s General Election. They say they want to prevent striking workers holding the country to ransom. The proposal has been denounced by the trade unions as a democratic outrage. Our political correspondent Chris Mason reports. Twice in the last four years, members of the National Union of Teachers have voted for strikes. Further walk-outs could still happen. But both would have been invalid under these new proposals. Next week, firefighters in Essex will walk out, but their strike could go ahead with these rules because plenty turned out and plenty wanted to walk out. The Conservatives say if they win the election outright, a union representing workers in health, education, transport and the fire service will have to do more than get more votes for a strike than against one. Instead, 40% of all those that could vote if they wanted to must support strike action. They also want ballots only to be valid if half or more of those with a vote actually turn out. A strike in the public sector affects many people who have no chance and exercise no authority over that strike whatsoever. Everybody who cares about the right of ordinary working people to stand UP of ordinary working people to stand up forjobs and pay should be worried about these proposals. The political calculation from the Conservatives is simple. They hope because more of us are reliant on public services like buses and schools than are members of trade unions, plenty will see this as a good idea. On Tuesday, bus drivers in London are due to strike, a walk-out that would not be legal under the Conservatives’ ideas. The Liberal Democrats said that the plan strangled people’s basic rights. GP practices in some parts of England are trying to ease the crisis on hospital accident and emergency units by offering more surgeries at the weekends. As Robert Hall reports, family doctors in West Sussex are among those who’ve agreed to see more patients. St Richards Hospital Chichester, another long day for staff working extra shifts and looking back at six weeks when they and virtually every department here were under constant pressure. 10% increase in activity, but particularly in the frail and elderly patients. I think when we looked at our data over 70% of our over-85-year-olds being admitted, up 30% from normal. A few miles away an alternative to A&E and one solution to the problem. In the run-up to New Year GP practices were asked for their help in lightning the load with extra surgery hours at the weekend. Eight surgeries across West Sussex answered the call for help. They opened in rotation throughout Saturday and Sunday to allow patients to visit the surgery closest to them. The idea is it should avoid hospital admissions and attendance at A and E which should focus on medical emergencies which are beyond the GP scope of care. It’s amazing because if I had gone to A&E I would be there hours waiting to be seen with a minor complaint. They told us it was going to be six hours so I was worried. But within a few minutes we had an appointment What do you think of an idea of taking pressure off A&E? Yeah for minor issues, if there is no appointments everybody is always going to be back to A&E. So far, well over 300 people have opted for the trial scheme which will be funded by the local Health Authority. It is a welcome respite but there are many challenging weeks ahead. Thousands of homes remain without power in Scotland tonight after a powerful storm overnight caused widespread disruption. Engineers are working to restore electricity but have been hampered by blocked roads and more bad weather. Our Scotland correspondent Laura Bicker reports. This is what power companies had feared, a second storm and gusts of over 100mph have brought down power lines across the Highlands and Islands. Despite the best effort of engineers, many homes spent a second day without power. It’s unbelievably inconvenient and the weather’s grim so it’s not great. We are sorry but I would want to reassure people, we genuinely have hundreds and hundreds of guys out there in teams working in difficult conditions. Elsewhere, off the coast of Brighton, one man has died and another is feared drowned after they were swept out to sea. One of them had gone to the water’s edge last night in the severe weather as part of a dare. His friend had tried to rescue him. Police described conditions as very dangerous at the time. The winds were so strong they dragged all 51,000 tonnes of this Carrier beached near Southampton. It moved over 100 metres, despite beached near Southampton. It moved over100 metres, despite being anchored on a sand bank. In Belfast these buildings partially collapsed as winds reached over 60mph. There seems no respite from thisjanuary weather. Tonight, thousands of homes across Scotland face a third night without power as forecasters warn of ice and snow. And The Met Office has issued another warning for Monday of more high winds to come. With all the sport here’s Lizzie Greenwood Hughes at the BBC Sport Centre. Good evening. There were eight matches in the Premier League today with repercussions at both ends of the table. Match of the Day follows the news, so if you don’t want to know what happened, you know what to do. Chelsea are the clear leaders again after a 2-0 victory over Newcastle. They’re now two points ahead of Manchester City who could only draw at Everton. Elsewhere, there were important wins for Burnley and Crystal Palace who both moved out of the relegtion zone as well as Leicester, Liverpool and West Brom. Aberdeen extended their lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership, beating St Mirren. Second-placed Celtic didn’t play, they have two games in hand. There were also wins for Dundee and Inverness. Today’s Rugby Union games will give the Six Nations selectors plenty to chew on ahead of next month’s tournament. Premiership leaders Northampton were beaten by Sale, Sam Burgess scored his first try for Bath and England captain Chris Robshaw made his comeback for Harlequins. Patrick Gearey has the details of their 32-12 victory over Leicester. A welcome sight for England fans, Chris Robshaw in the shirt of Harlequins. Williams put Leicester into the lead. Danny Care who would have impressed the judges with this Harlequins opening try. Robshaw appears to have healed well. A try put Ouinns up at the break. Space can be at a premium. just as well Yard can find the gap. The England wing spotted a hole no one else saw and Harlequins had control. Still room to put on a show. Mike Brown wants to nail down the English fullback spot. His run put in to secure the bonus point. Much to consider for England. That’s the sport. Thank you very much. That’s all from me. Good evening. It’s not all bad news. There is some sunshine in the bmmu There is some sunshine in the forecast but I have to say there is more potentially disruptive wind and rain over the next few days. Tonight it’s ice and snow to enter the fray. The showers are rattling across Scotland and Northern Ireland and turning to snow at low levels so some ice around and the high routes could be difficult overnight. Having said that, as you can see the southern half of the UK having a lot of dry and clear weather overnight. This is where the sunshine will be first thing in the morning, a bright sunny but chilly start to the day with that brisk westerly wind but fine weather to come. Further north a wintry scene and ice around. Slippery surfaces for sure here. Most of the snow at low levels will turn back to rain quickly. But more of the white stuff up over the Highlands for a time at least, turning increasingly wet across the north-west of Scotland. Dryer spells across Northern Ireland for a time but increasing cloud across western areas with showers breaking out. The best of the brightness hanging on across the eastern parts of England. A chilly feeling day. Temperatures five or six. The wind added on. Talking of winds, strong and gusty winds likely to return again on Monday and heavy rain in places, as well. Welcome to Match Of The Day, the first of a new series coming to you every Saturday. Welcome to Match Of The Day. Look at his face! just look at his face! Oh, look at that! Unbelievable!

In an unprecedented gathering, leaders from around the world join families of the victims in a march through the French capital. The three days of terror attacks cost 17 lives - today the marchers said they were there to stand up for democracy and freedom. It is exactly to show, we are this country of liberty and fraternity. The message is global, it’s notjust Charlie Hebdo, it’s notjust Charlie Hebdo comments for liberty which is attacked. A video emerges of one of the gunmen, saying the attacks were on behalf of Islamic State. The other headlines tonight: An independent task force is to be set up to improve cancer care in England. And more than 50 people are dead after an oil tanker crashed into a packed bus in Pakistan. Good evening from Paris, where more than Ao world leaders linked arms today in an unparalleled show of unity in the wake of the terrorist attacks in France. Theyjoined a march that brought well over a million people to the centre of Paris, showing their revulsion and defiance at the three days of violence that killed 17 people. There were similar gatherings elsewhere in France on a day that demonstrators stood up for democracy, freedom of speech and the values of the French republic. Our first report is from our Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson - whojoined the crowds on the unity march. They call it freedom. And today they came to flaunt it. A million people of different faiths, flags, languages: United in one message. So it is exactly to show, we are this country of liberty, fraternity. We want a better humankind so we have to be there. We don’t have to be in respect with the political idea of Charlie Hebdo but the message is more global. I think it’s notjust Charlie Hebdo, it’s all the liberty which is attacked. There are people here from every section of French society, some have come out onto the streets like this for the first time. These attacks were meant to silence and intimidate the residents of France. This is their answer. For others to rally marked a more private grief. The family of the policeman killed outside the offices of Charlie Hebdo held their own memorial at the local town hall. All around his mother, the slogans read, we or Ahmed. All of them symbolically her children now. TRANSLATION: Forthe symbolically her children now. TRANSLATION: For the rallies across the world, I think you. It means a lot to us. For once, the guests of honour ""the president but the families of those who died. The French president greeted them individually along with Charlie Hebdo’s surviving staff, fresh from working on next weeks magazine. Marching behind them, leaders from more than Ao nations, linking arms in solidarity with France. We are saying, this is an appalling terrorist attack, an attack on the values we hold dear in Britain, freedom of speech, tyrants, we want to stand with you to make that point. For most here, marching wasn’t that easy. Too many people had decided to come. The interior minister said the numbers were uncomfortable. The message to France’s attackers were stark, that however slow their journey France’s attackers were stark, that however slow theirjourney or painful the killings, those who are left will carry on. Earlier today a video emerged showing one of the Paris gunmen, Amedy Coulibaly, saying he carried out the attack on the kosher supermarket on behalf of Islamic State. It appeared to have been filmed after Wednesday’s attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo. Our Home Affairs Correspondent june Kelly has been looking at the gunman’s video. Amedy Coulibaly ‘s message to the world, posted on the Internet two days after his death. The man who murdered five people in a western capital pledges allegiance to the so-called Islamic state. With soundtrack and screen messages, the video shows him going through physical training and displays his armoury. He declared: You decide what is happening in the world, don’t you? Know, we won’t allow that. We are going to fight so that the words of Allah can be heard. Amedy Coulibaly died in a storm of police bullets at the jewish supermarket he targeted. He terrorised hostages and shot dead four people. A day earlier he had taken the life of a woman police officer. He is also now being linked to an attack on a jogger who was shot but survived. His video appears to be recorded after his associates, the Kouachi brothers, carried out their murderous assault on the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo. Amedy Coulibaly says, our team was divided into two, they went out against Charlie Hebdo, I went out against the police. We did things separately so as to have more of an impact. But while he professes himself to be a professor of Isis, his fellow killers, the Kouachis, are reported to have had links to a rival extremist organisation, Al-Qaeda. Terrorism is not about the Al-Qaeda directed plot now, where there were checks and balances as to how they would conduct operations, it is more independent. Meanwhile in Germany there has been a firebomb attack on a newspaper which reprinted some of this to recall cartoons from Charlie Hebdo. In Marseilles, the French city with the largest Muslim population, tens of thousands also joined a demonstration to remember the dead of Paris. But a prominent jewish leader in the city said manyjews were now deeply anxious and thinking of leaving France. Our Special Correspondent Fergal Keane reports now on the reflections elsewhere in France in the wake of the attacks. Commemorated in stone, it is the French city with the strongest links to the Arab world. And today tens of thousands of its citizens came out to march against extremist violence. These are days when even if only briefly, the pain seems mightier than the sword. And the plea for tolerance is deeply felt. Today, I feel like talking to each other, trying to understand him or her, is more important than ever. Why did you come? Because we are Charlie. We are all together. Of course. There is an impressive array of voices arguing for tolerance and coexistent in this city but it would be naive to imagine that they did divisions in this society, a complex mix of culture, politics and religion, will be swept away by the spirit of the moment. In the jewish community which suffered persecution here under the Nazis and more recent anti-Semitic attacks, the violence in Paris has unleashed fresh trauma. Genes are anxious like they have never been before, they all talk about leaving, that’s all you hear in the families, when will you leave? How will you leave? Whichjob will you do? Most of thejews think of leaving now because they don’t feel secure in France. I have to feel strong, to show that I am strong but in fact I am scared. In this city, with the largest Muslim operation in France, there is widespread revulsion at the violence but there is also a range of responses to the demonstrations. This woman, who wanted to protect her identity, condemned the violence but also the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. TRANSLATION: I want to say very firmly, I am against this terrorist attack but I have also the right to have my free speech and say that I am not Charlie, I am a Muslim ministers of France. From the city thatis ministers of France. From the city that is France’s gateway to the Arab world, there is a hopeful sense of coexistence but also unease about the future. It has been a debut meant symbolism here in France, more on that before the end of the programme.-- a day of immense symbolism. To some of the day’s other news now, and NHS England has announced it’s creating an independent task force to improve cancer care. It will focus on trying to diagnose the disease more quickly, and follows concerns that despite recent improvements, UK survival rates still lag behind Europe for many common cancers. Here’s our Health Editor, Hugh Pym. Survival rates have improved dramatically in recent decades but there is a sense of the UK needing to up its game for early diagnosis of cancer and giving patients better chances of pulling through. That’s the challenge with the new task force on experts set up. We are aiming to get to a definitive yes or no, this is or isn’t cancer, much faster than we are able to do today. We are exploring that through about 60 projects which we will take forward in the next 12 months. The pilot projects which will be run by the task force include letting patient referred themselves for diagnosis rather than going through their GPs, allowing patients to have different tests in the same place and on the same day and getting GPs send patients direct for specific tests without having to go through a specialist. All of this will come too late to help Erica, whose daughter Gemma died of cervical cancer. When she went to A&E, doctors didn’t pick up the symptoms even though she thought it was serious. I would even though she thought it was serious. Iwould hope serious. I would hope no one will have to go through what Gemma went through when she went to A&E, I hope there will be a place where you can be taken seriously. The opening of this new high-tech building this year will herald an important step forward for cancer research. The Francis Crick Institute, which will cover work on cancer and other diseases, is being billed as a world-class research facility, one of the largest of its kind in Europe. With more treatments coming on stream, resources are stretched. The Cancer Drugs Fund for medicines not available on the NHS will have to limit what it provides, an announcement likely to be controversial is likely this week. More than 50 people have died after the bus they were travelling on collided with an oil tanker in southern Pakistan near the city of Karachi. Their bodies were so badly burned, doctors are having to use DNA records to identify them. This is all that was left of the bus crammed with passengers, in cooking nine members of a single-family. It caught fire when a speeding oil tanker hit it head on. Pakistan has a poor record for road safety but this accident was particularly horrific. Some people travelling on the roof of the bus were able to iump the roof of the bus were able to jump off but almost all the other passengers were killed. Distraught relatives gathered at the local hospital. His mother and uncle, shown here, were both on board the bus. TRANSLATION: My sister was there, and my daughter’s sister-in-law and brother-in-law. This man lost his elder sister and brother. Doctors say DNA tests will be needed to identify bodies that were burned beyond recognition. They include several children, found clinging to their mothers. Ed Miliband has called for the energy regulator to be given new powers to force companies to pass on reductions in the wholesale price of oil and gas. The Labour Leader told the BBC he would demand fast-track legislation on energy in a Commons debate next week. The companies insist they are passing on price cuts to consumers. Ben Wright reports. Tanking oil prices are being felt at the pumps but home energy bills have not fallen and this week Labour will hold a Commons vote on their plan to force energy firms to cut prices. It will get the regulator the power to cut prices, bring immediate relief. It’s time for the government put their money where their mouth is. We have a zombie parliament that isn’t passing much legislation, letting the last three months, let’s do something that makes a difference. Last week the Chancellor ‘s Ed Balls in wholesale prices must be passed onto consumers and ministers argue Labour’s existing plan for a price freeze is keeping energy prices high now. But Labour are keeping their political focus on prices and wages, the key, they say, to bringing down the deficit. That would be the subject of a politically symbolic vote this week. A Conservative plan to commit the next parliament to £30 billion of savings. Ed Miliband says it’s a gimmick but his party will support it anyway. He has called this a gimmick but today he has announced he’s going to support it. That is all welcome news but what the British public want to know is if he is now supporting this further £30 billion consolidation, how is he going to pay for it? The same question being asked of all parties. The specific spending cuts and tax rises to come have not been spelt out. In the meantime we have built in the Commons meant to symbolise the choices in front of voters. A statue of the late Margaret Thatcher has been unveiled on the Falkland Islands, as a tribute to the former Prime Minister. She’s regarded by many islanders as a heroine for recapturing the islands for Britain in 1982 after an invasion by Argentinian forces. It’s an important night in Hollywood, as the Golden Globes ceremony takes place in Los Angeles. British nominees hoping for an award include Eddie Redmayne for ""The Theory Of Everything"", Benedict Cumberbatch in the ""The Imitation Game"" and Rosamund Pike, for ""Gone Girl"". ""Downton Abbey"" and ""Game of Thrones"" are shortlisted in the best TV drama category. Back to our main story now and the unity rallies taking in France, following this week’s terror attacks. Let’s rejoin Mishal Hussain in Paris. The sea of humanity, united in a common cause but also the individuals making powerful statement of their own. Some draped in the French flag, some with the now familiar slogan, je Suis Charlie, others calling for togetherness in the face of fanaticism, but it wasn’tjust here in France that the terrorist attacks were remembered. There were gatherings in the UK, and in London, thousands gathered. Some of the capital’s landmarks had their own show of solidarity. Our correspondent reports on Britain’s reflections. On a chill winter evening, bright colours which captured the mood below and sent a heartfelt message across the Channel.

The huge turnout was replicated across France, with a total of nearly four million people taking part. In Paris, 40 leaders from around the world joined President Hollande, who called Paris today ‘the capital of the world.' Our first report is from our Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt, They call it freedom and today they came to flaunt it. One million people of different faiths, flags, languages - united in one message. So, it is exactly to show we are a country of liberty, of fraternity and want better human kind, so we have to be there. We don’t necessarily have to be in respect with the political idea of Charlie Hebdo but the message is more global. I think it’s notjust Charlie Hebdo, it’s all the liberty which is attacked. There are people here from every section of French society. Some have come out on to the street like this for the first time. These attacks were meant to silence and intimidate the residents of France - this is their answer. For others the rally marked a more private grief. The family of the police man who was killed outside Charlie Hebdo held their own memorial today at the local Town Hall. All around his mother, the slogans red je suis Ahmed. TRANSLATION: For the rallies in Paris, in France and across the world, I thank you. It means a lot to us. For once, the guests of honour were not the President, but the families of those who died. The French President greeted them individually, among with Charlie Hebdo’s surviving staff, fresh from working on next week’s magazine. Marching behind them, leaders from more than 40 nations, linking arms in solidarity with France. We’re saying, this is an appalling terrorist attack. It is an attack on the values that we hold dear too in Britain about freedom of speech, about democracy, about tolerance and we and we want to stand with you to make that point. Marching here was not too easy, too many people decided to come. The Interior Minister said the numbers were unaccountable. The message to France’s attackers was stark, that however slow theirjourney or painful the killings, those who are left will carry on. A video emerges showing one of the Paris gunmen saying he acted on behalf of Islamic State. He killed a police woman and four hostages before being killed. Amedy Coulibaly has been dead two days. A video posted on the internet, prepared, strengthen yourself internet, prepared, strengthen yourself to frighten the enemies of Allah. The man who teror rised this nation mocks France, even as it rallied. TRANSLATION: You decide what happens in the world, don’t you? We will not allow that. We will fight to spread Allah’s word. Police shot Coulibaly dead in a Paris supermarket on Friday. He says his actions were revenge for France bombing and killing fighters and civilians in Syria’s so-called Islamic State. His attackses were co-ordinated. With the rampage by the Kouachi brothers, although they pledged allegiance to a rival group Al-Qaeda in Yeman. Ourteam allegiance to a rival group Al-Qaeda in Yeman. Our team was divided in two. They went out against Charlie Hebdo. I went out against the policech we did some things together and some separately, so we could have a bigger impact. It is inconceivable that Isis would sponsor one action and at the same time Al-Qaeda in the Yeman will sponsor another. These two organisations are almost at war. They are killing each other in Syria. A non-descript Paris flat is where Coulibaly lived along with his wife. They were seen here a few days ago. The they wours, like -- neighbours, like the rest of France tell us they are shocked. They were normal people. Very discrete, very polite - normal people. Very discrete, very polite - always saying hello and thank you. Always had a smile. Never a word about politics or religion. So, even Coulibaly’s neighbours did not think he posed a threat. It points to a dilemma facing western Governments. How can they identify the most violent extremists? The leaders pledged to do more to stop people travelling to Syria but they cannot guarantee there’ll not be future of attacks. Hayat Boumedienne is believed to have fled before his attacks to Syria. Despite today’s show of unity, France remains in the sights of radical extremists. Today’s marches were a national event in France, taking place far beyond Paris. In Marseilles, home to France’s largest Muslim population, Let’s Commemorated in stone, it is the French city with the strongest links to the Arab world. And today, tens of thousands of its citizens came out to march against extremist violence. These are days when even if only briefly the pen seems mighter than the sword. And the plea for tolerance is deeply felt. Today, I feel like talking to each other, trying to understand him or her is more important than ever. Why did you come together? Because we are Charlie. Only Charlie. You are all together? Yes. We are together, of course. There is an impressive array of voices in this city, arguing for tolerance and for coexistence, but it would be naive to imagine that the deep divisions in this society, a complex mix of culture, politics and religion will be swept away by the spirit of the moment. In the jewish community which suffered persecution here under the Nazis, and which suffered persecution here underthe Nazis, and more recent anti-Semitic attacks, the violence in Paris has unleashed fresh trauma. jews are very anxious, as they have never been before. They all talk about leaving. That’s all you hear in the families, when will you leave? How will you leave? Whatjob will you do? Most of thejews think of leaving now. They don’t feel secure at all in France. I have to feel strong to show that I am strong, but in fact, I am very scared. In this city, with the largest Muslim population in France, there is wide-spread revulsion at the violence. There is a range of responses to the demonstrations. This woman, who wanted to protect her identity condemned the violence, but also the Charlie Hebdo cartoons. TRANSLATION: I want to say very firmly, I am against this terrorist attack, but I have also the right to have my free speech and say that I am not Charlie. I am a Muslim citizen of France. This is a city with a vibrant racial and religious mix, where Muslims are part of the political mainstream. Main steam. The mayor says tolerance will be the way forward. Marseille is as can many tolly tan city. People are touched because the nationalities are mixed. We face the Mediterranean and people know the richness of our mix here. From the city that is France’s gateway to the Arab world there is a hopeful plea for coexistence, but shadowed by a deep sense of unease about the future. Let’s join our Paris correspondent, Lucy Williamson, who’s in Place de la Republique, from where the marchers set off - people from all walks of life. What did you make of today? How representative was this crowd of French society? Well, it is hard to imagine looking at the Place now that a few hours ago you could not squeeze your way in here. The Place itself and the roads around it were completely blocked. The Government were saying the numbers were unaccountable. They tried to count them in the end and they think perhaps one and a half million people may have converged on Paris today. Two-and-a-half million in other towns and cities. Being here this afternoon, what was striking to me was the diversity of the crowd. There were lots of families, lots of elderly people. We saw a young boy on crutches who made his way here and the mood - on crutches who made his way here and the mood - very warm, very positive. People really wanting to come out and make it clear how strongly they felt about the values that had come under attack. I think the world will have been watching this march today and I think France also surprised itself with how strongly it felt. Thank you. It has been a day of powerful symbolism in France. I’ll have more on that before the end of the programme. For now, Clive, back to you. Let’s look at some of today’s other news now, and NHS England has announced it’s creating an independent task force to iITIpIâoVâ CBFICEF CBFE. It will focus on trying to diagnose the disease more quickly, and follows concerns that despite recent improvements, UK survival rates still lag behind Europe for many common cancers. Here’s our Health Editor, Hugh Pym. Survival rates have improved dramatically in recent decades. There is a sense of the UK needing to up its game for early diagnosis of cancer and give patients better chances of pulling through. That’s the challenge for the new task force of experts set up by NHS England. What we are aiming to do is to get toa What we are aiming to do is to get to a definitive yes or no, this is or isn’t cancer, much, much faster than we are able to do today. We are exploring that through about 60 projects which will be taken forward over the next 12 months. The pilot projects which will be run by the task force include: Letting patients refer themselves for diagnosis rather than going through the GPs. Allowlinging patients to have different tests in the same place and on the same day and letting GPs send patients direct for specific tests without having to go through a specialist. All of this will come too late to help Erica, whose daughter died of cancer. When he wept to A&E, doctors did not pick up the symptoms, even though she thought they were serious. I would hope no-one will have to go through what Gemma went through when she went to A&E. I would like there to perhaps be a place where you can be taken seriously and even if you are one of these people who is a time waster, they can weed those people out and get to the people who need it. The opening of this new high-tech building this year will herald an important step forward for Cancer Research. This institute, which will cover work on cancer and other diseases is being billed as a world-class research facility. One of the largest of its kind in Europe. But with more treatments coming on stream, resources are stretched. The Cancer Drugs Fund for medicines not normally available on the NHS is about to cut the number of drugs which can be financed. An announcement is likely to be controversial is due this week. More than 50 people have died after a bus collided with an oil tanker in Pakistan near the city of Karachi. Both vehicles burst into flames. The tanker was reportedly speeding and travelling on the wrong side of the road when it hit the bus head-on, and the tanker driver is said to have fled the scene. Officials say they can only identify the dead using DNA records. Search teams looking for the wreckage of an AirAsia plane, which crashed into the java Sea a fortnight ago, say they’ve detected electronic signals that may be coming from one of it’s flight recorders. Divers will try to retrieve it tomorrow. The aircraft came down in bad weather, killing all 162 people on-board. Power supplies have been restored to most of the homes affected in the north of Scotland by the recent heavy storms. Scottish Hydro says more than 100,000 customers now have their electricity back, since gale force winds hit power lines on Friday, but around 10,000 are still without power. Ed Miliband has called for the energy regulator to be given new powers to force companies to pass on reductions in the wholesale price of oil and gas. The Labour leader told the BBC he would demand fast-track legislation on energy in a Commons debate next week. The companies insist they are passing on price cuts to consumers. Here’s Ben Wright. Tanking oil prices are being felt at the pumps - Tanking oil prices are being felt at the pumps - home Energy Bills have not fallen. This week, Labour will hold a Commons vote on their plan to force energy firms to cut prices. It will give the regulator the power to cut prices. It is time for the Government to put their money where their mouth is. We have a zombie Parliament, which is not doing anything. Is not passing much legislation. Let’s n the last three months oh this Parliament, do something which will make a difference. Last week, the Chancellor said falls in wholesale prices must be passed on to consumers. Ministers argue Labour’s existing plan for a two-year price freeze is keeping energy bills high now. One analyst said giving Ofgem the power to force price cuts could backfire. What you could see is this damages trust in the market. It damages consumer trust in the market. It actually reduces switching rates and competition in the market. Labour are keeping their political focus on prices, the cost of living and wages. The key, they say, to bringing down the deficit. And that will be the subject of another politically symbolic electioneering vote in the Commons this week. A Conservative plan to commit the next Parliament to £30 billion of savings. Ed Miliband said it is a gimmick, but his party will support it anyway. What the British public want to know is if he is supporting this £30 billion of necessary consultation is how will he pay for it? He has no plans to bring about further savings in Government departments. He has plans for more borrowing, more spending and debt. He has plans for more taxes. If that is what he’s planning to do, then the British people deserve to know about it. Labour does not accept the £30 billion figure and big differences are emerging teen the party’s plans for dealing the deficit. Tomorrow David Cameron will say making Britain live within its means will be the first theme of the Conservative Party’s manifesto. The Swedish actress Anita Ekberg has died at the age of 83. She was best known for her role in Federico Fellini’s 1960 film, La Dolce Vita. The scene in Rome’s Trevi Fountain is one of cinema’s most iconic moments. She died in Rome this morning following a series of illnesses. Let’s return to our main story tonight, the Unity March in Paris where one million people, and 40 world leaders showed solidarity with the victims of the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Mishal Husein is in Paris for us. Thanks Clive. Today’s unity march has seen unprecedented numbers of people on the streets here in Paris and across France - an event that will become a key moment in French history. I’mjoined by our Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt. It is hard not to have been moved to have seen the sentiment, the emotion on the streets - have seen the sentiment, the emotion on the streets - what if anything does it lead to? The numbers were huge. It is was a really impressive day for France. Obviously what the Government hopes is such crowds will weaken support for the extremists. They have no illusions. They actually expect further terrorist attacks. That’s not to say that this amazing show of unity is without value. The French President this week has been saying, ""we are Charlie now."" We are police officers now - Charlie now."" We are police officers now - we are alljews in France now. He came out and said he hoped the spirit ofjanuary 11th, He came out and said he hoped the spirit of january 11th, today, spirit ofjanuary 11th, today, will continue. As a result of that, France would be a different place. Well, of course, we’ll have to see about that. That is a very big aspiration to have? Yes, absolutely. There’s no disguising, there are divisions in this country. There is a stagnating economy. There is a ",,

And firefighters battle a blaze at recycling plant after 900 tonnes of rubbish caught fire. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. After a dramatic car chase this morning through the French countryside in which shots were fired, the two brothers suspected of murdering 12 people at the Paris office of the magazine, Charlie Hebdo, are holed up. In the town of Dammartin-en-Goele, 25 miles north of the capital. They’re holding one person hostage and have said they are prepared to die as martyrs. These are live pictures of the print works in the town, the building is surrounded by huge numbers of police with helicopters circling overhead. The tense and fast-moving scenes happened as people in Paris continue to try come to terms with the violence that was inflicted on their cityjust two days ago. And we we have heard news of another shoot-out. Now let’s go first to Lyse Doucet. Right now there is evolving a dramatic end to a dramatic story. Over this road is the sleepy town of some 8,000 people. They have been told to remain indoors by the police authorities. Children have been told to leave schools, there have been teary reunions with their parents. There is a lot of police in the area. Hundreds have been deployed in a massive security operation. The Interior Ministry spokesperson told the that the police are moving slowly and cautiously. The two suspects in the case, they are now holed up in a print works factory, are said to be highly dangerous and heavily armed. They are believed to have a hostage. We can give you a close of up shot of the town. The police have taken up positions on the streets there. Att the streets there. At t beginning now of a stand-off, a stand-off that has only begun in the last few hours. It is uncertain how long it will last. But with two men inside saying that they are preparing to die, many fear a bloody end to the bloodiest incident in France in more than 50 years. Now the latest developments. The first indications that a major police operation was underway. One by one, the approach road to the village of Dammartin-en-Goele were blocked off. journalists were ordered to leave. The two suspects, brothers, Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi, are reported to be holding at least one hostage. Spotted yesterday near Villers-Cotteret but thought to have moved on to nearby Longpont, after having stolen food and fuel from a petrol station. Through the night, Longpont was flooded are armed officers, going house-to-house, aware that the suspects that they were hunting were ruthless and heavily armed. The two brothers are thought to have then stolen another car and moved on. thought to have then stolen another carand moved on. Hundreds car and moved on. Hundreds of officers raced after them. The pictures were broadcast live around the world. Witnesses said that they heard gunfire along the road as the suspects fled. The chase ended in Dammartin-en-Goele this morning. Helicopters circled over he’d. On the ground, the suspects were searching for a place to hide. Cherif Kouachi’s lawyer urged him to surround. I have own one piece of advice to give to Mr Kouachi, to hand himself over to the police authorities so that all light can be shed on this case. The French Interior Minister, Santi Cazorla, emerged from a meeting with the President and the Prime Minister this morning to say that yesterday’s police operation had revealed important information and that all of the police in the area had been immobilised for the operation in Dammartin. The two suspects are holed up in this building, owned by a printing company. One man told French radio, he had gone for a meeting and met the suspects, assuming that they were police officers. The person who pretended to be a policeman told me to go away as they do not kill civilians. That struck me profoundly. I decided to call the police when I realised that the person who spoke to me was in fact a terrorist. I met a terrorist and shook his hand. The building is surrounded by hundreds of armed officers. They are reported to have made contact with the suspects, who have said that they are prepared to die. Residents have been told to stay in homes, hundreds of children and teachers are taking refugee in the local high school. We are really scared. We want the people to know that the children are OK. We are about 900 persons, we are really scared. TRANSLATION: We will evacuate the children a few at a time, using buses. We are to take them to the town centre to a hall where the parents can get them. I ask the children’s parents to remain at home. Wait for us to contact them. Two days after the murder of 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo attack, the hunt for the suspects appears to be nearing a resolution. The hunt for the suspects appears to be nearing a resolution, as he say but a massive manhunt is continuing in a huge security operation across the country. It is unprecedented in French history. Some 90,000 police and troops are now on the streets and in the squares across France. The area around Paris is on maximum alert. Our correspondentjon Brain alert. Our correspondent jon Brain looks alert. Our correspondentjon Brain looks at the manhunt. Over the past 72 hours, the pictures have looked out of pictures and television screens around the world. But there are many questions about the brothers. Both men known to the authorities. Cherif Kouachi, seen here in a documentary was a convicted terrorist. What sort of surveillance were he and his brother under, if indeed any? Cherif Kouachi wasjailed in 2008. Said Kouachi is believed to have been trained by Al-Qaeda in Yemen. It is believed that the brothers were on a US terrorist database and a no-fly list. The attack in Paris began at 11. 30 #578 when they entered the offices of Charlie Hebdo and killed 11 people. Five minutes later they were on the street. After opening fire on a police vehicle blocking the road, they drove north where they encountered another police officer. One of the gunmen shot him in the head. By mid-day, the police had lost track of them. The gunmen had crashed their car and hi-jacked another vehicle to continue their escape. This morning the French President revealed that there had been other terrorist attacks planned in the country in recent months. I will not go into details but there were attempts to carry out operations. We knew that anything could happen at any time. As we stand here at the present time, we should do everything to guarantee the protection of our citizens. But for now, the attention remains on the attack that did happen and with such tragic consequences. In a ceremony today, Charlie Hebdo magazine was made an honourary citizen of Paris. The Mayor described it as a way to give strength to the values that it represents. Dammartin-en-Goele is the main focus of the massive security operation but it is not the only one. There has been another incident in the east of the city, a shooting incident and reports of another hostage-taking. Christian, what is the latest there? Chaotic scenes in Paris. There are sirens being heard around as the police head off to the east of the city. We have been reporting through the morning that the man involved in a shooting in Montrouge in southern Paris yesterday who killed a young police woman, there were reports that he is known to the two brothers holed up in Dammartin. A link had been established. We heard there has been an attack on a k ah kosher supermarket in the east of the city. SWAT teams are racing there now. So two live hostage situations underway. Inside the supermarket we are told that the man has two Kalashnikov rifles. There are five hostages we understand inside, women and children. We are hearing from an Israeli blogger, known to us, thought to be reliable, that the shooter has said to the police ""you know who I am, I am going to keep the hostage takers fool the siege of the two men in Dammartin is lifted"" that points to a link being established between the three men. One other aspect, we heard from Santi Cazorla that the man who is in Dammartin -- Santi Cazorla that the man who is in Dammartin -- Bernard Cazanov, that the man had been in prison in 2008, and while there, he was vehemently anti-Semitic. So you must presume that the men think in the same way. So a precarious and a tense situation here in Paris developing at the moment. Christian Fraser there, at the moment. Christian Fraserthere, in Christian Fraser there, in a very, very sensitive time and a tense time with new developments almost every hour. Now, let’s get the latest on what is happening in Dammartin. My correspondent is near there. He can join us now. Chris, I know you are close to the building where the two suspects are holed up. What are you hearing or seeing there? We are at the police cordon, closest to the factory. We can see the roof of the building where the company, where the printing company where the two gunmen have taken this hostage, apparently. Things have calmed down a bit. When we first got this as this story was breaking, it was fairly tense. Half a dozen helicopters in the air, armed men running in every direction trying to secure a perimeter. They have done that now. The objective now it to calm that situation down. If there is a hostage in the building, they will want to try to negotiate to get the hostage out safely. That is the first priority. The good news for the police is obviously they know after two days of intensive searching exactly where the two gunmen are. The bad news, of course, is that they were unable to find them in the middle of an isolated area. They have managed to get back into an area where they can still do people some harm. And, Chris, no sign at all from any of the police that you have been able to speak to, to get a sense of how long this can go on for? No, only a sense that they are now willing to take it slowly. They don’t want to rush anything. The initial issue was getting other people out of harm’s way. There were several schools relatively close in the town of Dammartin to where the gunmen arrived. So they wanted to get people out, to get the area secure. Then to try to start a dialogue. But I don’t think that they are under illusions about the kind of people that they are dealing with. A senior official said earlier, that the objective is to neutralise them. That has several connotations, that I think that the political leadership would like to bring these men to justice, political leadership would like to bring these men tojustice, to bring these men to justice, to show that France can beat these kind of acts of terrorism. But on the other hand there is a knowledge that some French media reports are suggesting that in the first contact made with the gunmen, that they expressed a wish that they wanted to obtain martyrdom. Chris Morris outside of Dammartin. This is a situation involving hour- by- hour, This is a situation involving hour-by-hour, two hour- by- hour, two days after the tragic shooting of the 12 people of the offices at Charlie Hebdo. This is a country in maximum alert, still in mourning and still very tense. Back to you in London. The home office ministers of several European countries will meet on Sunday to discuss the threat posed by extremists. The government here has promised to provide the security services with the resources they need to watch suspects. Our Security Correspondent Gordon Corera reports. The security service MI5 is according to a rare speech last night facing a growing, context terrorist threat, one which is increasingly difficult to deal with. In his speech behind closed doors, Andrew Parker revealed in recent months police and MI5 had stopped three UK terrorist plots, from which deaths would certainly have resulted, but he added a stark warning, we cannot hope to stop everything, he said. Mr Parker said that while the number of crude but potentially deadly plots has gone up, Britain still faces more complex and ambitious plots including Al-Qaeda, planning mass casualty attacks against the West. Syria and Iraq remained the largest source of the problem. At least 600 Britons have gone out to become involved in violence. The MI5 chief revealed. Some may come back a threat, others here may be inspired by the messages of those out there. In his speech last night, which was planned before the attacks in France, the head of MI5 said his greatest concern was the widening gap between this threat and MI5’s degreasing ability to deal with it. That particularly because of the challenge in intercepting the communications of extremists. MI5 learns about its targets by monitoring and analysing their communications, but those communications have increasingly moved from telephones to online Internet-based technologies, which Internet- based technologies, which analysts Internet-based technologies, which analysts say are harder to monitor. You there are a range of mediums and people use code. For a security service to capture this information and know where to look becomes more complicated. Security has been tightened at Bryn’s ports and borders. MI5 says it is stretched. Its head has warned we face a long haul when it comes to the terrorist threat. Our top story this lunchtime.

The strongest wind, away from the mountains, was registered at 113 miles an hour at Stornoway. Rail and ferry services were disrupted and 200 schools and nurseries have closed for the day. Let’s go now to the Highlands and our correspondent Lorna Bicker. It was rural areas such as this one here in the Highlands that were the worst affected. Infact, the last time a gust of 130 miles an hour was recorded in the Western Isles was 50 years ago. As you can see, this is the calm after the storm. And before the next one, which is allowing the clearer to get under way. Scotland woke up battered by the storm. The northern and western isles bore the brunt of hurricane force winds. Records were broken in Stornoway, with a gust of 130 miles an hour. -- 113. Key commuter routes were closed for a time, such as the Forth Road Bridge, due to overturned vehicles. Rail services were stopped for safety reasons. We have seen extensive damage in some parts of the network, damage to overhead power lines and signal equipment and debris such as tree branches and property, furniture, buildings etc dumped onto the railway. We are checking for damage, recovering the lines and reopening them as we can. Engineered battled with debris to try to get things moving again. Schools such as this one in Paisley were closed due to damage and tens of thousands of homes have been left without power. In the Highland town of Mallaig, few managed to sleep through the howling wind and waves. The worst of the weather has passed and the winds are now beginning to ease. But for power companies the race is on, to restore water supplies to communities across Scotland such as here in Mallaig before the next storm passes through. Repairs are underweight at this boat yard after the windows were blown in. No power in this community means no water supplies. When the power and the water are out, that is when it is really bad. When it is one all the other you can make do, but when it is both it is a nuisance. This storm was short and sharp. There is hope the remedy will be as well, before a weekend of more wild weather. Within the last hour, around 30,000 homes have had their power restored, but that leaves around 70,000 homes without electricity this lunch time. Engineers say they are doing what they can in difficult circumstances. The next weather warning is on its way and will take effect this evening. The winds are not expected to be as strong tomorrow, but with it will be some snow. Once again, in Scotland, we are battening down the hatches. The private health company, Circle says it wants to withdraw from running the Hinchingbrooke Hospital near Huntingdon. The company took over the trust three years ago to sort out its finances and to improve the quality of care. Circle says reasons for its contract no longer being viable include a surge in numbers at Accident and Emergency. It comes as NHS England says many A&E departments failed last week to meet their targets. Our Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. Hinchingbrooke Hospital was a unique experiment, an NHS hospital run by a private company. In 2009 the hospital was in danger of going bust, running up debts of EAO million. The then Labour government invited private companies to bid for the contract to run Hinchingbrooke. Circle was appointed by the coalition in 2011. Today, the company called time on the experiment. This hospital over the last year has seen unprecedented accident and emergency admissions, sometimes at 30%, year on year. The Department of Health has said it is disappointed that the decision but unions have criticised the deal from the beginning, arguing that generating a profit for shareholders can have no part in running a hospital. Forcing a privatised model on the NHS was never going to work. This was always going to fail. One of the reasons cited by the company for the ending of its contract is the unprecedented pressure it was experiencing in its AMD department. Figures published by NHS England this morning show those pressures are widespread throughout the health system. A&E staff at Wigan infirmary have seen the reality of that pressure in recent weeks. Figures published today reveal waiting times in A&E units across England have got even worse in the New Year. Performance dropped to its lowest level for a decade, with 86.7% of patients seen in four hours in the first week of the year. The target is 95%. It comes as a number of hospitals have declared major incidents. The latest figure is the worst since weekly recording began in 2010. This reflects a system that is working at red-hot capacity and 20,000 extra patients went to a and B last week on paid to the same week in the previous year. It is notjust in England where A&E departments are struggling. Across the UK, waiting times are being missed. The system is feeling the pressure of winter. Let’s speak to our health editor, Hugh Pym, at Hinchingbrooke Hospital. Circle was the first company to do this. Opponents might be saying, I told you so. Unions are saying a pinching, did with warm this would not work, you bring a private company in, they walk away at the first sign of trouble. Labour is saying the coalition must take responsibility. They handed the contract to Circle and should have done more preparation on this and looked at the numbers and realised they would not stack up. Government sources are saying it was Labour who started this probe -- process. They said Hinchingbrooke Hospital would not work under the NHS and another bride rider had to be brought in. It depends where you start in this debate. Many patients thought the hospital seemed to be doing pretty well from their point of view. There is a wider debate which can only intensify, whether more private provision is desirable in the NHS, or whether it is a back door route to privatisation. We will hear more in the run-up to the general election. The head of the Professional Footballers’ Association has apologised after comparing the Ched Evans rape case to the Hillsborough disaster. Gordon Taylor said the ""last thing"" he intended was to upset anybody connected to Hillsborough, where 96 supporters lost their lives after a crush in the stadium in Sheffield. Here’s our correspondent Andy Swiss. This morning, Gordon Taylor was having to defend himself. Comments about Ched Evans’ having to defend himself. Comments about Ched Evans’ attempt to clear his name, in which he made a hugely controversial comparison. He would not controversial comparison. He would not be the first person or persons to have been found guilty and maintained their innocence and then been proved right. If we are talking about things in football, we know what happened, what was alleged to have happened at Hillsborough, and it is now unravelling and we are finding it is very different to how it was portrayed at the time. That comment, relating the Ched Evans case to the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool fans died, was widely condemned as insensitive and inappropriate. This morning, he apologised. The last thing I intended to do was upset anybody connected with the Hillsborough case, because I have long been a supporter of them. If that is the impression I gave, it is totally wrong and I am sorry. It is completely crass. His apology did not change his original error, according to one of the authors into the Hillsborough disaster. Somebody so prominent in public life can actually blur the distinctions between guilt and innocence in relation to Hillsborough, at a time when the inquests are in full swing and will be in session for at least another year. and will be in session for at least anotheryear. Gordon another year. Gordon Taylor insists he will not be resigning from his post here, which he has held for more than 30 years, but a week in which football has attracted plenty of negative headlines is ending amid more controversy. at the first sign of trouble. Labour is saying the coalition must take Now a look at the weather. We will take a closer look at the storm system. You can see it racing towards the British Isles. The weather system responsible deepening very rapidly, which brought those severe gale force storm force winds, with Stornoway recording a gust of 130 mph. In the Cairngorms, the winds hit 140 miles an hour. That is the storm system today, which works out into Scandinavia in the east. The next one comes in off the Atlantic and brings outbreaks of rain across Northern Ireland, into western Scotland. In Cumbria, the rainfall totals will mount up over the next 24 hours and there is the risk of flooding. Further south, cloud, patchy rain, none of it particularly heavy, but the south-westerly winds will drag up mild air. Highs of 13 degrees in London. Overnight tonight, stormy again. The area of low pressure will undergo rapid cycle of Genesis, the pressure falling rapidly, bringing another stormy night. Stornoway does not get away with it, highs of 90 mph in gusts across the Northern Isles. Across the mainland Scotland and northern England, 50-70 miles an hour. As the weather front pushes south, cold air flows in and things could turn icy on the across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. The squally weather front pushes south across England and Wales, bringing an intense bout of rain. Gusty winds and as the front pushes through temperatures top, snow showers. As much as ten centimetres expected over the Scottish mountains. Temperatures will be falling through the day. Starting at 11 degrees in Birmingham, 5 degrees later in the afternoon. By Sunday, we see south-westerly winds brewing in the next weather system. More rain in Northern Ireland and the North West of Scotland and North West of England. We could see snow on the leading edge as it bumps into the cold air. Early next week will turn significantly colder on Tuesday. A risk of snow showers pushing in, remained in windy. We have weather warnings in force for rain, strong winds, snow and ice. Keep up-to-date by visiting the BBC weather website. More now on More I’IOW OI’! OUT two suspects are reported to be holed up in the town of Dammartin-en-Goele, 25 miles north of Paris. Let’s return to Lyse Doucet who is there for us. The stand off continues. There it is behind me, the town of Dammartin-en-Goele. 8,000 people told to stay inside while the police operation continues, slowly and carefully. But this is not the only crisis on the minds of the authorities. In Paris this morning on the eastern edge of the city, a gunman entered a cosher supermarket, there are reports of a host-taking there as well. Our correspondent is there. Ho what is the latest coming from that area, and that incident? There is a major incident I am told. I am standing 200 to 300m from the supermarket. It is shielded by 30 police vans, more arriving as I speak. We are told that there is a hostage-taking. We are told at 1.00pm, a man brandishingt Kalashnikovs entered thejewish supermarket. Shots were fired. We are hearing that there are five or six people inside. It seems that there is a link with the incident here and of the previous shootings. We will keep an eye on that situation across France where there are 90,000 troops and police deployed in a major turning point, a defining moment that is being watched all across the world. Many thanks. The top story this lunch time: After a dramatic chase through the French countryside, the two suspects in the Paris shootings are holed up in a factory north of the capital. 90,000 police are involved in the operation to capture the gunmen, holding a hostage. That is all from us. Now on BBC One it is time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Welcome to BBC London News, I’m Alex Bushill. The capital’s French Institute has set up a book of condolence for victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack. Members of the public have been queuing outside the Institute, waiting to sign the book and pay their respects. Our reporter Sarah Harris has been gauging the mood at the Institute. The queue started to form well before the book of condolence opened at the French Institute in Kensington.

Gunfire and explosions are heard at the printworks where the men wanted for the attack on Charlie Hebdo had been holed up. There are reports that Cherif and Said Kouachi, the two gunmen, have been killed in the assault. It follows a massive police and military operation in the area. Local schools were closed and the children taken to safety. And in eastern Paris, further explosions after attackers took hostages at a kosher supermarket. Police release these images of the suspects. There are reports that at least one of them has been killed, along with a number of hostages. Parisians have paused to remember the victims of terrorism, and the partner of the magazine editor killed on Wednesday shared her views. Tell the truth to people.

The other headlines tonight: The first private company to run an NHS hospital pulls out of its contract, as the health watchdog places the hospital in special measures. And hurricane-force winds in Scotland leave tens of thousands of homes without power. Tonight on BBC London: After the Paris terror attacks, there are claims that one of the gunmen had links to a London mosque. And, the grandmother who died after waiting five hours for an ambulance. Her family say the delay was crucial. Good evening from Paris, where French security forces hunting the men behind the country’s deadliest terrorist attack in decades have brought two separate sieges to an end. There’s been gunfire and explosions at a building where the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine were holding a hostage. It’s understood that Cherif and Said Kouachi were killed in the assault in Dammartin-en-Goele, north-east of Paris. In eastern Paris, in a supermarket where a gunman seized hostages in a kosher supermarket, the police have launched an assault and freed a number of people. There are reports that the hostage taker and a number of hostages are dead. First tonight, straight to Dammartin and our correspondent Damian Grammaticas. The silence shattered. It wasjust before five p.m.. Gunfire and explosions. The siege had been going on for almost eight hours. Inside, officers where the two member had been hunting had holed up. Together with them, one hostage. -- been hunting had holed up. Together with them, one hostage. -- where the two men had been holed up. A violent end for the attackers who had killed 12 in Paris this week. For several hours there had been calm, as police said they were trying to make contact with the men inside. But now we have and police units moving in. Closing in on the suspects, French police have this morning given chase down a highway just outside Paris. From the air, they converged on the area, two, half a dozen helicopters hovering where the Paris attackers had peeled off into an industrial zone. The men had shot their way through a police checkpoint. They ended up at a small printing company in Dammartin, police in hot pursuit. This man and his colleagues had just got to work on the industrial zone. We heard the helicopters and knew the suspects were in the area, he said, so we started locking ourselves in. The police told us to evacuate immediately. But as police moved in, some were still stuck in their officers. This woman told me her daughter had telephoned to say, ma’am, there is gunfire and the terrorists are here. The police were guarding those left in one room, the lights switched off while the operation was under way. Cornered, Cherif Kouachi and side Kouachi were still calm, according to one man. He said they pretended to be police. TRANSLATION: They were heavily armed like special forces members. TRANSLATION: They were heavily armed like specialforces members. I was outside the door of the office. I shook hands with one of them. He told me they were police and ordered me to leave, as they did not kill civilians, so I left. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry told me officers were taking their time, worried about the safety of any hostage and the lives of security forces. Children who had been in classrooms near to the scene of the siege were evacuated, too, brought out in small groups to be reunited with anxious parents who had waited hours for them. For these families and those watching across France, relief. Three days that has brought violence and fear to the country might finally be over. Well, a matter of minutes after that assault... Minutes after the assault in Dammartin-en-Goele there was more drama in eastern Paris when security forces stormed a jewish supermarket. A gunman had taken several hostages and threatened to kill them if security forces moved in. Police said a gunman was killed in the Paris operation. Several people were freed and taken to safety but there are reports that a number of hostages died. Lucy Williamson is there for us. Well, just behind me here in central Paris, a violent stand-off today between police and a heavily armed couple who had taken several hostages into a supermarket. We have just heard that five people died in the stand-off, including one of the hostage-takers. This is how the events unfolded. Nothing says panic like this. Anti-terrorist police, stalking gunman in a Paris neighbourhood. A desperate bid to save France’s latest victims, lunch time shoppers, taken hostage within sight of the Eiffel Tower. At one o’clock today, the attackers, armed with machine guns, walked into thisjewish supermarket and took at least five people hostage. These are the key suspects. 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly, and his 26-year-old girlfriend, Hayat Boumeddienne. This is the second time today that France has faced a hostage situation in or around the capital. Whether or not they are linked, the ambition of the attackers is clear, and it is likely to change the way this country views its security, its safety and its society. With the darkness came the assault. Local media caught the moment when commandos stormed in. And the first tentative sight of survivors. Some too small to run for freedom already know how precious it can feel. There are questions for the authorities here about why Wednesday’s attack happened when so much was known about the Kouachi brothers’ links to organised terror groups. The brothers’ terrorist connections go back at least as far as 2008, when Cherif Kouachi was jailed for trying to recruit fighters to go to Iraq. While injail, he met this man, Djamel Beghal, once called Osama Bin Laden’s chief recruiter in Europe. He had attended Finsbury Park Mosque in London while it was controlled by the radical preacher Abu Hamza, and allegedly recruited the shoe bomber, Richard Reid. It is understood at least one of the brothers, Said, underwent military training in Yemen with Al-Qaeda, and both are barred from entering the United States. Today it emerged that Amedy Coulibaly, one of the suspects involved in today’s siege at the supermarket, knew Cherif Kouachi and also had links to Djamel Beghal. There will be questions about how the network worked and why some of the links were not spotted before the attack at Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday. In a moment we’ll hear from Damian Grammaticas in Dammartin-en-Goele, north-east of Paris, but first Lucy Williamson is in eastern Paris for us. Bring us up-to-date on the operation right now. You can probably hear there is still quite a lot of activity here in Paris. The siege may be over but there are a lot of police and ambulances still moving around. This incident may be over, but there is no doubt it will haunt people in Paris for many weeks to come. The question remains in their minds, how could this happen in a state that has such a reputation for tough security, and what will happen tomorrow? Lucy, thank you very much. Let’s go north-east of Paris and talk to Damian Grammaticas. Your assessment of the events there today. What is interesting is that we have been hearing more detail now coming out of the end of the siege here, that very violent and dramatic end. Officials have been saying that the two attackers may have exit of the building, coming out firing, and that was when the security forces responded and moved in. We had heard earlier in the day from a witness, someone they had stolen a car from, saying they perhaps sought martyrdom. Again, more questions about whether the police could have foreseen this. Thank you very much. Apologies for a couple of problems on the image quality. Earlier today the city of Paris honoured the victims of the attack outside the Hotel de Ville. Among those at the ceremony wasjeannette Bougrab, the partner of the editor of Charlie Hebdo Stephane Charbonnier. In an interview with the BBC, she said her partner was a fighter for freedom and described him as ""a beautiful man"". She was speaking to our special correspondent Fergal Keane. Ina In a city traumatised by violence, banners declaring solidarity and defiance. Paris is Charlie. We are Charlie. Grieving friends and relatives were at City Hall. Among them, jeannette Bougrab, widow of the murdered editor, Stephane Charbonnier. One hour before he was attacked, you sent his wife a text saying, I love you. jeannette Bougrab told me how after the attack she had desperately tried to reach the body of her husband. We went to Charlie Hebdo. A lot of policemen in the street. When I arrived, I did not know if my husband was alive or was not alive. People said he had died. And I could not believe that it is possible. Because he is too young. Only 1+7 years old. This was him with colleagues in the newspaper offices. When she arrived, she begged police to be allowed to see his body. I did not want to leave my husband alone. I would like to sleep with him. But a lot of police have to do their work. But I did not want to let alone the body of my husband. In his last ever cartoon, he depicted a fundamentalist warning of attacks on Paris. His widow now wants the state to confront radical Islam. We have to tell the truth to people. It is a war. 12 people were killed by terrorists. Across France, Muslim clerics were asked to condemn the violence at Friday prayers. At the grandma skin Paris, there was strong security and sympathy for the victims of extremist violence. -- sympathy for the victims of extremist violence. -- at the grand Mosque.

Will you fight on for freedom of speech? I will stay in France and fight for freedom but I know that I could be killed by a terrorist. It is possible in France. Welcome to France. Ijust want terrorist. It is possible in France. Welcome to France. I just want to cry. jeannette Bougrab, the partner of Stephane Charbonnier, the editor of Charlie Hebdo, who lost his life in the attack on Wednesday. We’ll have more from Paris later in the programme, but for now over to Reeta in the studio. Our top story this evening: Police kill the two men behind the attack on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper after a hostage siege north-east of Paris. In a separate siege in Paris itself, one hostage-taker is killed. It’s believed a number of hostages are also dead. Later on BBC London: Hundreds of Londoners turn out to sign a book of condolence in memory of the Paris terror attack victims. And, the Rugby World Cup winner who’s aiming to become an Olympic champoin in another sport. join me for that at 6.30pm. Burns supper. Now the family home is to serve them all year round. The preacher Abu Hamza was for years notorious in Britain for his radical views. Today a court in Manhattan sentenced him to life, for a series of terror offences. He was convicted last year of a number of crimes, including taking hostages in Yemen, and trying to set up an Al Qaeda training camp in the US. Today we heard that he was linked to one of the gunmen in Paris. Our North America Editorjon Sopel is in New York. Perhaps for that reason there is up usually tight security outside the Federal Court house here in Manhattan. He addressed the court, cutting a forlorn figure, pleaing for leniency in where he should serve his term. The judge was having known of it. She said that he had shown himself to be evil and read exerts from his speeches and said he had shown no remorse whatsoever. A far cry from how he was originally perceived by the authorities in the UK. Abu Hamza was initially seen as a pantomime villain. just do it - anything... A loud mouth - certainly. Extreme - without a doubt. But the authorities thought he was ultimately a harmless cleric, whose bark was worse than his bite. That changed after 9/11. Other young Muslims were being radicalised. This man was paid by MI5 to spy on Abu Hamza. For years, he says the preacher was allowed to operate freely and has this message for the now convicted terrorist. You are going to serve your sentence here, but you still have to face justice with God. Don’t think that you are going to heaven. Never, ever. There is no place for you there. It was only in 2012 that the controversial cleric was flown to the US to stand trial. Last May he was convict of supporting terrorists and hostage taking in yeman in 1988. This man and his wife were part of those western tourists. He was rescued but his wife was killed along with three others. It has been a long time coming for him to be tried and found guilty in the United States for a crime he probably should have been prosecuted in Britain and could have been over probably a decade ago. It has taken a long time, but nearly 12 years on from the first raid on the Finsbury Park Mosque, the legal road has reached its end and Abu Hamza will never be seen again. Well, Abu Hamza addressed the court, saying he insist that he was innocent and his defence team have indicated that they intend to appeal against the sentence that hasjust been delivered. Many thanks. Cana Can a private firm run a hospital. Today it says it will withdraw from its contract, blaming funding cuts and pressures on casualty. Its announcement came hours before the NHS watchdog in England placed Hinchingbrooke in special measures, saying safety and leadership were inadequate. Here is our health editor. It was the first NHS hospital to be run by a private sector health company. Today that operator circle said it will hand back the keys to Hinchingbrooke because it cannot make the sums add up. Further investment over and above the 1+.8 million that we have invested from Circles Resources and man pou ler be required going further. That is not appropriate for a small organisation like Circle. Unions are saying, we told you so. When you looked at the contract Circle made unrealistic claims that they could reduce the deficit and at the same time provide a profit to shareholders. We always said that was not going to be achievable. Patients and visitors had varying views on the hospital and the care provided. The staff were great. The staff are excellent, actually. With the midwife raito to -- staff are excellent, actually. With the midwife raito to -- ratio is good. I have had two knee replacements andvy been to the eye clinic. And OK, fine. Even the waiting time was not that bad either. But the regulator, the Care Ouality Commission said today it had rated it as inadequate and recommended it was put into a special monitoring regime. Circle earlier said it disagreed with the findings. The surge in patient numbers going into Accident & Emergency is one reason quoted by Circle for wanting to end its contract here at Hinchingbrooke and figures today from NHS England emphasise again the stresses being felt across the whole system. The Government’s target is that 95% of patients in England should be seen at A&E within four hours. The latest weekly figures showed fewer than 87% were seen in that time. Other parts of the UK are experiencing problems. Supporters of the Hinchingbrooke deal say these pressures could not have been predicted when the contract was signed. Opponents claim it was always flawed. It was a test case for the involvement of the private sector in the NHS, and the way the saga has unfolded will fuel an increasingly acrimonious debate. Some of the other stories: Signals or pings have been detected in the java Sea, which could have come from the black box recorders of the crashed AirAsia flight. The plane disappeared from radar on the 28th December with 162 people on board. Specialist divers are now searching the area.

Eddie Redmayne and Felicityjones, who star in The Theory of Everything, are also up for Best Actor and Best Actress. Hurricane-force winds left tens of thousands of homes in Scotland without power and have caused widespread travel disruption. The strongest gusts were recorded in the Islands, reaching 113 miles per hour in Stornoway. Power companies are still working to restore electricity to 75,000 properties tonight. Our Scotland correspondent, james Cook, reports. In the dark of night and the dead of winter the storm swept ashore. Even for the Orkney Isles, this was ferocious. It battered the harbour and left tens of thousands without power across Scotland. Among them this B and B in the Highlands, where it was cooking by torch light. That was to serve up a candle-lit breakfast. 1+am the power went out - that was us, total darkness. It was fine during the night. Everyone is in bed. When it comes to breakfast, it is different. By candle-light, as you can see. Engineers were out to prepare the damage. This is difficult and dangerous work. Repairs are needed on the ground too on the Isle of Lewis roofs were smashed by a gust of 113 miles per hour. The wind was breaking the connecters that hold the wires on to the top of the poles. Trees coming through the lines and stuff like that. The forth Road bridge had to be shut for a time. The driver had a lucky escape, so too did guests at this hotel in Inverness, which had to be evacuated at the height of the storm, not to mention passengers on the sleeper from London, which hit a tree, but limped on to Aberdeen. Believe it or not, this is actually the calm between two storms. It was much wilder than this here last night and there’s another big weather system on the way. Time for a look at the weather. We’ve had a brief lull in the winds. They are picking up guns again. 93 miles per hour at High Bradfield. Strong gusty winds picking up. Quite a bit of rain on the cardses as well. -- cards as well. It is all down to this cold front. It is bringing in the rain and the strong gusty winds. Gusts of around 90 miles per hour possible again up to the Northern Isles. For mainland parts of Scotland 50-70 miles per hour gusts. So, it is a cold front that is bringing us the gusty winds and the outbreaks of rain. The urge the day tomorrow, goes towards the south and east. Cold and bright, with some sunshine. A return to some wintry showers, particularly in the north-west. Some snowfall to low levels here. Much colder, around two to nine Celsius. Mild air first thing Saturday. As this cold front shifts south, the mild air will be replaced by much colder air streaming in from the north-west through the course of the weekend. That cold air still in charge as we look through into Sunday as well. For Sunday, windy again. Further rain and hill snow towards the north and the west. Quieter first thing further south and east. Some sunshine. Clouding over with rain later and turning cold. We have a lot happening in the weather. Warnings in force for winds and a return to snow, ice and heavy rain. Keep up-to-date with the latest forecast. Thank you. just time for an update on events in France in Paris. Thank you very much. Let’s remind ourselves of today’s traumatic events. As police dealt with two major hostage incidents following the terrorist attacks of recent days. This is what has been happening. There was gunfire, loud explosions at the print works, north-east of Paris, where the men wanted for the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine were taking refuge. The two gunmen were killed in that assault. It is understood they came out shooting at police. They were then killed. It followed a massive police and military operation in the area. Local schools were closed. Children were taken to safety. There was a hostage there who has also survived. Thenin survived. Then in eastern Paris, there were further explosions. Gunfire after attackers took hostages at a supermarket there. Police have released these images of the suspects. There are reports that at least one of them has been killed as well as, we think, four hostages. We are getting more details of what happened there in eastern Paris. We are being told that the gunman there was apparently praying at the time police went in and launched their operation. There were fears there clearly that he was about to kill some of the hostages. Our correspondent is there for us. Can you shed any more light on the circumstances of that operation there? Well, the information is coming out in dribs and drabs. The report there that one of the hostage takers was praying at the time of the assault. report there that one of the hostage takers the assault. There are initial reports suggesting that one hostage taker may still be on the run. So, police are obviously looking into that and that explains some of the anxiety and some of the activity around here. There’s no doubt that across France there’ll be great relief tonight that these two extraordinary sieges are over. Thank you very much. More coverage on the BBC News Channel and on the BBC News website for you throughout the evening. Now it Tonight on BBC London: The Paris terror attacks - there are claims that one of the gunmen had links to a London Mosque. Its new leaders now fear reprisals. We saw what happened after the Rigby murder, when some mosques were burned in some places. We hope this won’t happen here. Also tonight: The grandmother who died after waiting five hours for an ambulance. Her family say a quicker response might have saved her life. been avoided. And the linking of the lying on the floor for those five hours with pneumonia and with her death, that is what I have got a problem with. Two men are jailed for this shootout with police in north London. Plus: Strictly is soon to tour the capital. But the contestants still have to face the toughest judge. I willjust be myself. My normal, kind, beautifulself. Loving, nurturing, all-embracing self. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. First tonight, there’s a claim that one of the two gunmen suspected of carrying out the Paris terror attack had links to a mosque in north London. Cherif Kouachi was killed this afternoon by police in France, but it’s believed he’d been mentored by a member of Al-Qaeda who operated out of Finsbury Park Mosque at the same time as the extremist preacher Abu Hamza, who, in the past half hour, has been sentenced to life in prison in America. The claim has been made by a former MI5 informant who went undercover in London. The mosque’s new leaders don’t deny the link, but say it happened under a previous administration. Nick Beake has the story. Worshippers in Finsbury Park today remembered the victims of the Paris attacks in their prayers. And condemned the colours. Evil people. They don’t belong in our society. Others defended the right criticise religions. It doesn’t mean, if somebody says something to you, you go and kill people. It is unacceptable. But, the legacy of Abu Hamza and the radical brand of Islam he once preached here has what mosque back into the spotlight for the wrong reasons. This was one of his new tenant in North London -- lieutenants. He was laterjailed in France. It was later claimed today that he was a mental in prison to one of the suspected Paris murderers, Cherif Kouachi. The allegation was made by a former MI5 SPY allegation was made by a former MI5 spy who infiltrated the mosque in the late 90s. He told a national newspaper, there is no doubt you can see the influence of the teachings in him. in the media. We have to take extra precaution. We have to be more careful about how we deal with this matter in term of security. There is also frustration. But despite ten years of different leadership here, the old regime still casts a shadow. The mosque is completely different story at the moment. If you compare it with what it has been before 2005. I mean, I can referto it with what it has been before 2005. I mean, I can refer to it as an error of community confusion, instead of an error of cohesion when it was before 2005. A sentiment reinforced by the local MP. Abu Hamza has long gone from this building. This is a good example of what a good religious institution and organisation can do to bring back peace and understanding between faiths. As Abu Hamza sentenced to life behind bars, Finsbury Park Mosque wants to consign him to history. But it seems the hatred he cultivated years ago could have been channelled into the brutal violence in France this week. Prince Harry has signed a book of condolence for the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack, at the French Embassy in Knightsbridge. He added his name to a growing list of signatures which are being added, as Londoners express their sympathy for the 12 people gunned down on Wednesday. Let’sjoin Sarah Harris, who’s at the embassy for us tonight. Yes, this is the room at the French embassy where diplomats, politicians, and indeed Royalty have come to pay their respects. Boris johnson sent flowers, you can see just over there. Theresa May has been to sign the book of condolence. As you say, you can see the message there, with warmest best wishes from Harry. He met with staff here at the embassy as well. just down the road at the French Institute, Londoners have been saying why they wanted to come and sign the book of condolence there. Queues started to form well before the book of condolence opened at the French Institute in Kensington. Most were Londoners, wanting to make a stand against the atrocities in Paris. jackie Young is from Hamstead, and knows first-hand about the horror of extremism, having escaped the Nazis in the 1930s. I wanted to offer my solidarity to the French people, of this horrible incident that has happened. I myself came from Austria, I was born in Vienna, I came out of those horrors, and Ifelt that we should stick together as humans. One thing you can’t accept is violence of that level, simply because you do not like what someone has said or written or drawn. If people don’t stand up and show solidarity, I know it sounds cliched, but we all suffer. We have an election here in four months’ time, I would hate to think that democracy suffered as a result of what happened in Paris, what might happen here in London. And from younger generation, a 16-year-old schoolboy from London came to the French Embassy in Knightsbridge with the message, not in my name. He said some of his friends were too afraid to speak out. I believe it is important not to be afraid. If you don’t get your voice out, I think it is worth. Silence of the worst thing in my opinion.

The report there that one of the hostage takers was praying at the time of the assault. report there that one of the hostage takers the assault. There are initial reports suggesting that one hostage taker may still be on the run. So, police are obviously looking into that and that explains some of the anxiety and some of the activity around here. There’s no doubt that across France there’ll be great relief tonight that these two extraordinary sieges are over. Thank you very much. More coverage on the BBC News Channel and on the BBC News website for you throughout the evening. Now it Tonight on BBC London: The Paris terror attacks - there are claims that one of the gunmen had links to a London Mosque. Its new leaders now fear reprisals. We saw what happened after the Rigby murder, when some mosques were burned in some places. We hope this won’t happen here. Also tonight: The grandmother who died after waiting five hours for an ambulance. Her family say a quicker response might have saved her life. been avoided. And the linking of the lying on the floor for those five hours with pneumonia and with her death, that is what I have got a problem with. Two men are jailed for this shootout with police in north London. Plus: Strictly is soon to tour the capital. But the contestants still have to face the toughest judge. I willjust be myself. My normal, kind, beautifulself. Loving, nurturing, all-embracing self. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. First tonight, there’s a claim that one of the two gunmen suspected of carrying out the Paris terror attack had links to a mosque in north London. Cherif Kouachi was killed this afternoon by police in France, but it’s believed he’d been mentored by a member of Al-Qaeda who operated out of Finsbury Park Mosque at the same time as the extremist preacher Abu Hamza, who, in the past half hour, has been sentenced to life in prison in America. The claim has been made by a former MI5 informant who went undercover in London. The mosque’s new leaders don’t deny the link, but say it happened under a previous administration. Nick Beake has the story. Worshippers in Finsbury Park today remembered the victims of the Paris attacks in their prayers. And condemned the colours. Evil people. They don’t belong in our society. Others defended the right criticise religions. It doesn’t mean, if somebody says something to you, you go and kill people. It is unacceptable. But, the legacy of Abu Hamza and the radical brand of Islam he once preached here has what mosque back into the spotlight for the wrong reasons. This was one of his new tenant in North London -- lieutenants. He was laterjailed in France. It was later claimed today that he was a mental in prison to one of the suspected Paris murderers, Cherif Kouachi. The allegation was made by a former MI5 SPY allegation was made by a former MI5 spy who infiltrated the mosque in the late 90s. He told a national newspaper, there is no doubt you can see the influence of the teachings in him. in the media. We have to take extra precaution. We have to be more careful about how we deal with this matter in term of security. There is also frustration. But despite ten years of different leadership here, the old regime still casts a shadow. The mosque is completely different story at the moment. If you compare it with what it has been before 2005. I mean, I can referto it with what it has been before 2005. I mean, I can refer to it as an error of community confusion, instead of an error of cohesion when it was before 2005. A sentiment reinforced by the local MP. Abu Hamza has long gone from this building. This is a good example of what a good religious institution and organisation can do to bring back peace and understanding between faiths. As Abu Hamza sentenced to life behind bars, Finsbury Park Mosque wants to consign him to history. But it seems the hatred he cultivated years ago could have been channelled into the brutal violence in France this week. Prince Harry has signed a book of condolence for the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack, at the French Embassy in Knightsbridge. He added his name to a growing list of signatures which are being added, as Londoners express their sympathy for the 12 people gunned down on Wednesday. Let’sjoin Sarah Harris, who’s at the embassy for us tonight. Yes, this is the room at the French embassy where diplomats, politicians, and indeed Royalty have come to pay their respects. Boris johnson sent flowers, you can see just over there. Theresa May has been to sign the book of condolence. As you say, you can see the message there, with warmest best wishes from Harry. He met with staff here at the embassy as well. just down the road at the French Institute, Londoners have been saying why they wanted to come and sign the book of condolence there. Queues started to form well before the book of condolence opened at the French Institute in Kensington. Most were Londoners, wanting to make a stand against the atrocities in Paris. jackie Young is from Hamstead, and knows first-hand about the horror of extremism, having escaped the Nazis in the 1930s. I wanted to offer my solidarity to the French people, of this horrible incident that has happened. I myself came from Austria, I was born in Vienna, I came out of those horrors, and Ifelt that we should stick together as humans. One thing you can’t accept is violence of that level, simply because you do not like what someone has said or written or drawn. If people don’t stand up and show solidarity, I know it sounds cliched, but we all suffer. We have an election here in four months’ time, I would hate to think that democracy suffered as a result of what happened in Paris, what might happen here in London. And from younger generation, a 16-year-old schoolboy from London came to the French Embassy in Knightsbridge with the message, not in my name. He said some of his friends were too afraid to speak out. I believe it is important not to be afraid. If you don’t get your voice out, I think it is worth. Silence of the worst thing in my opinion. If the world comes together and speak together and make sure they get their opinion known, maybe we can stop people like this from acting this way. Through love and compassion, maybe we can change them as well. Some just signed the book, others wanted to write their thoughts. The French Institute says the book will be open as long as there is a demand for it. Well, I think it is fair to say that there can often be some rivalry between the neighbouring cities of Paris and London. But over the last few days, Londoners have shown in their hundreds that when the chips have been down they wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder and show solidarity with their French cousins. joining me to discuss events in Paris further is Nabila Ramdani, a French journalist of Algerian descent, who lived in Paris before moving to London several years ago. We heard earlier of possible connections between the suspected Paris gunmen and a north London mosque. That’s going to be a worry for a lot of us. Well, absolutely. These kind of cross-channel terror networks are inevitably going to be the focus of safety in the UK, especially so as the attacks in France were carried out with disturbing ease. Let’s not forget that France is a short journey away across the Channel, and an atrocity like this bomb, like the bomb attack in London, is in the high mind of people. It is important that all precautions are taken to avoid similar attacks on British soil. So, connections are being developed across the Channel. Also, Muslims here are very vocal about condemning these attacks. We saw in the report in Muslim schoolboy signing the book of condolence. It is quite heart-warming to seeing the outpouring of support of what is essentially human tragedy. Christians, atheists, Muslims and jews were killed during the outrage in France. It is quite right to say that people moved to express their emotion. As far as free speech is concerned, that is what we are hearing it again and again, is this an attack on your free speech as a journalist, my free speech as a journalist, and the free speech of everybody here? No, journalism comes with responsibility. Legislation should take care of that, to make sure that we produce responsible journalism, especially when it comes to sensitive issues. So, I think, to put it bluntly, certainly some people are going to think twice about the content of their work. Is that wise? I believe so. You believe it is right for people to think twice before people say what they want to say? No, I think it is an inevitable consequence. It is sad thatitis inevitable consequence. It is sad that it is going to be one of the consequences of this. But I think the rule of law and legislation under a diplomatic system should guarantee that you and I can continue to do our work within the boundaries of them raw. People are wondering about that the law. People are wondering about this, this is all over a cartoon. That is very simplistic. If you look at the powerful impact that cartoons can have, historically, if you look at the vindictive and indeed hateful depiction ofjews in the run-up and indeed during the Holocaust, nobody would argue that it contributed to create a climate of hate towards jews, which directly lead to violence against that community, and indeed to the massmurderer which is now associated with the third Reich. There is a great responsibility which comes with this. Thanks very much for your time. There’s lots more to come on the programme before 7pm. We’ll be hearing from the Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger, who’s been speaking about the tragic events in Paris. The daughter of a 92-year-old grandmother who died after waiting five hours for an ambulance believes her mother could be alive today if she’d been seen earlier. Bridgette Forde died in December after a fall at her home in Muswell Hill. Once she finally got to hospital, she waited a further 14 hours for treatment, before dying of pneumonia. Marc Ashdown has the story. There are sympathy cards everywhere, in the very room where 92-year-old Bridget Ford fell and broke her hip. Her daughter called an ambulance, and waited five hours, helpless. Then 14 hours in A&E. She feels the care her mother received to save her, in truth, contributed to her death. I love my mum completely, and to lose mum, although she was 92, that is awful. But the thought that that loss could have been avoided, and the linking of the lying on the floor for those five hours with pneumonia and with her death, that is what I have got a problem with at the moment. So, I am notjust grieving for mum, I am actually thinking about, if we had left the hospital, if we... I am left with a load of ifs. What isn’t in doubt is that hospitals across London are struggling to cope. Many A&Es have been well below the target of seeing patients within four hours. The nursing staff care, the doctors care. But, they are overstretched, they are overworked, there is a quick turnover in beds. How can you cope in a situation like that? The London Ambulance Service has apologised. They say they’re taking up to 5000 calls a day at the moment, and have to prioritise people in immediately life-threatening conditions. I hate it. I am a doctor, I am a GP, I care for people like that, so it is tragic. And our sympathy goes to her family. And that is not the kind of performance that we want to see. But we are absolutely dedicated to making our services better. We want to provide world-class care, and most of the time we do that. There is a crisis in the National Health Service. It has been coming for some time. It is now here. And what we have to do is to look at why it is here, not blame the other party. Stop blaming, stop the shaming, stop the sneering, stop using the health of the NHS as a political football. Because what you are talking about is people’s lives. We’re talking about life and death situations, we are talking about people being treated with dignity and respect. A 65-year-old man who abused young boys in south west London in the 1970s and 80s has beenjailed for four years. Charles Worth, formerly known as David Berry, carried out the attacks at a number of locations, including his home in Raynes Park, and at Morden Swimming Pool. He was arrested in February at Gatwick Airport. A mother from Essex who defrauded friends and strangers out of thousands of pounds by claiming she had terminal cancer has escaped an immediate jail term. 2lI-year-old Danielle Watson claimed donations, freebies and cut-price deals for her wedding worth almost £10,000 by saying she had late-stage cervical cancer. The court was told she is now attempting to repay her victims. She has used all the tricks in the book, to be honest. And unfortunately it has gone in herfavour at this point, which doesn’t give anyjustice to the genuine people out there who need to raise the money. So, Iam gutted, really, to be honest. Two men who got into a gun fight with firearms officers in north London earlier this year have been jailed for a total of 27 years. Sedat Meric was carrying out a revenge attack on the West Green Road Pool Hall with his accomplice Oktay Ayanoglu, Well, Victoria Hollinsjoins us from the Old Bailey. Yes, this happened on the first night of a bank holiday in May last year. The 23rd of May. It was warm night, it was late at night, but there were lots of people on the street. Two men headed up to North London for essentially a revenge attack. They drove to West Green Road pool bar, near Turnpike Lane. A revenge attack, because a fight had taken place in top in the night before. The two men wanted to make their mark as a result of this attack. Meric had paid ÂIooo to use a car and to use a gun for the night. Little did they know that when they were taking part in this, they are being watched by undercover police officers from the National Crime Agency. CCTV showed what happened next. Meric approach the doorway of the bar with the Paul Barr, he fires four times into the pool bar. One of the police officers runs across the road, Meric fires at him a total of seven times. The officer returns fire. The shoot out continues behind parked cars. Meric only stops when he runs out of bullets. That is when he gives them is when he gives ‘s offer. The National Crime Agency say this could have had much more severe consequences. The bravery shown by my officer, simply bearing in mind that he was shot at eight times during the attack, and kept on moving forward until he arrested the offender. It could have been a completely different outcome if he had been hit by one of the bullets. Very dramatic pictures there. What did the judge they? Thejudge here at the Old Bailey commended the bravery of the firearms officer, who has remained anonymous in this case. In a statement in court today, judge Michael Topolski said, he acted with courage and resolve... He sentenced the two men today in court for their part in possession of a firearm and intent to endanger life will stop Meric received I5 years, and Ayanoglu received I2 years. Previously, both men had been of good character. They had been hard-working man. One had worked on kebabs shop. But he said the people of North London could have been injured or killed in this attack. In fact, he said, it was miraculous that no one had been injured. Stay with us tonight, because still to come: Strictly comes to London - we’re at rehearsals for the show’s UK live tour. It’s that time on a Friday evening to get updated with all the sports news, with Sara Orchard. Thank you, Asad. Well, events in France today were at the forefront of the Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger’s mind this morning, as he attended his pre-match press conference for his side’s game with Stoke on Sunday. The Frenchman has now lived in London since 1996, but remains a prominent and respected figure in his native country. He expressed his dismay at events in France, extending his sympathies to those involved, and explained his hopes for the country moving forward. I think that in a country like France, you can die today for your ideas, and the way you want to speak. It is absolutely shocking, and I think the whole country is in shock, and I hope that at the moment the whole country is united. And I hope it will not create a divided country. The consequences of that would be terrible for the country. Earlier today, the French Football and Rugby Federations announced that all fixtures this weekend would observe a minute’s silence for the victims of the terrorist attacks. Back in London, ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations, Senegal officials are trying to prevent West Ham striker Diafra Sakho from playing for the club. The 25-year-old is sidelined with a back injury, but Senegal wanted to assess the player’s injury themselves. Sakho has stayed in London, with West Ham insisting his injury is genuine. The England Rugby Union Captain Chris Robshaw will return to action for his club side Harlequins tomorrow, after five weeks with a shoulder injury. The Quins flanker has undergone surgery, but is now fully fit to face Leicester Tigers tomorrow. He’s also expected to lead England in their up and coming Six Nations campaign, starting in February. Now, women’s Rugby World Cup winner and Tottenham-born Maggie Alphonsi has switched her sporting focus to athletics, as she tries to qualify for the Rio 2016 Olympics. It might seem a world away from rugby, but she hopes to compete in either discus, shot put or hammer. I caught up with her at a training session last night to see if she can go, or throw, the distance. Competing and winning. It is a habit Rugby World Cup winner Maggie Alphonsi is loath to quit. Having retired from international rugby, she is now focused on a career in athletics. Throwing, to be exact. Although she is missing her England team-mates. I am missing the girls. Especially when you are training. When you train on your own, it is very weird. You are so used to having the other 11+ or 20 girls around you, and you were used to that level of banter as well. Really, in the world of athletics, it is just me on my own. It is a very different environment compared to rugby. Now training twice a week at the Lee Valley Athletics Centre at shot put, discus and hammer, can her world champion strength from rugby be turned into a top-class thrower? Anyone coming from a different sport, especially rugby, certainly has the potential to become a thrower. But with Maggie, what makes her unique, for me personally dealing with her, isjust her attitude. To still want to continue with another sport, Iam impressed. Because I probably would retire quite happily, and be sitting at home watching TV. But the 31-year-old isn’t the first athlete to switch sports. Rebecca Romero won Olympic silver in rowing in 2004, to come back in 2008 and take gold in cycling. It really is quite daunting for Maggie to be doing her sessions here at Lee Valley, because this is where some of the best athletes in the whole of Great Britain come to train. At the moment, they have all got their eyes on the Rio Olympics in 20 months’ time, but so does Maggie. If it happens, I will be absolutely over the moon. Even if Ijust got there, it would be amazing. I truly believe she could be number one in this country. Definitely not this year, because it is her first season, this year is going to be an introduction to the sport. Next year, we are going to really see what she can do. But, I think she can make the Olympics. Rio would be nice. Tracy refuses to measure Maggie’s throws until she has refined her technique. But the first competition is planned for the summer, and, on all accounts, Maggie is in with a shot. What a story if she makes it. Good luck Maggie. That’s all the sport, back to you, Asad. Back in 2004, when we first got sight of celebrities dancing under a glitterball, performing the Foxtrot, you would have been forgiven for thinking the programme wouldn’t be a storming success. But, 11 years on, the format has been copied around the world. And for many, Saturday evenings aren’t the same without it. That’s why Strictly is going on the road once again, and Wendy Hurrell has been to rehearsals. Strictly devotee or not, everyone must at least be aware of the ballroom bonanza that happens every year. More than 11.5 million of us watched the final in December. Now, contestants and professionals are rehearsing in Primrose Hill for this year’s tour. I am still on a bit of a come-down. So, this tour has been a bit like rehab. To wean me off Strictly. Don’t go cold turkey, go on tour! Yes! It replicates the format on TV. Complete with the mean judge. I willjust be myself. My normal, kind, beautiful self. Naturally, darling. Loving, nurturing, all-embracing self. He says the live show has extra sparkle. You are seeing the truth glitz and glamour of those Swarovski crystals, darling. They are blinding, absolutely blinding. The television really doesn’t do them justice, I can tell you. But there must be a reason, beyond a magpie attraction to glitter, that Strictly is now a decade old. Len and I had a talk about it, when we first started back in the May of 2004. We gave it literally three weeks, and we thought we would be off-air. And, we were shocked, and pleasantly surprised, that actually millions of people were watching it. And, when you consider that it has gone to 50 countries worldwide, and is the most produced format in the world, there is something right about it. Well, we do like to see friendships flower and endure. The pleasure of you dancing with me. Exactly! And, bit of underdog endeavour to lift the trophy. This is my opportunity now, to get the feeling of lifting it up in front of everybody. That is what I am hoping for. The glitterball! I’ve got it! After touring the country, the Strictly stars return to London in early February. Ballroom dancing, selling out both Wembley and the O2, who would have thought it ten years ago? Now the weather, with Chris Fawkes. We are hearing about strong winds up in Scotland. Is it heading our way? We will get some strong winds but not on the scale of those in Scotland. But if you are planning a journey to Scotland, we have got another storm system there. The same storm system is going to push this weather front southwards and eastwards. What that is going to do is introduce a squally band of rain. Behind the front, the air is going to get colder for us. Overnight tonight, little sign of that, it is going to be quite a cloudy start of the night. The cloud will be with us throughout the whole night. Thick enough to give us some drizzle in the air. Mainly across the hills towards the south and west. In the centre of town, you might get away with a largely dry night until dawn. A mild night, temperatures between 11 and 13 degrees. Saturday morning is looking like a squally band of rain coming through. Behind the band of rain, it is going to turn colder. If you are heading out on Saturday morning, take your umbrella. We will see a short lives Bell of intense rain, could reach 55 mph. It will be mild, untilthis rain, could reach 55 mph. It will be mild, until this weather front comes through. That line of blue is whether Weatherford is at 10am. Into the afternoon, we get some sunshine. It will be a dry afternoon. The winds are in a north westerly direction. The temperature is going down. The afternoon will be about five Celsius colder than it will be in the morning. It will feel chilly out and about. A cold start to Sunday with some frost, particularly auroral areas. A decent looking day. Sunny spells in the morning, some patchy cloud. For most of us it should stay dry, perhaps some showers later in the day. Temperatures lifting to around 90 degrees in the centre of town. On Monday, -- 19 degrees in the centre of town. On Monday, --19 degrees. On Monday, we have got rain on the way. The weekend is not looking too bad. Before we go this Friday evening, a reminder of tonight’s main news headlines: There are dramatic scenes in France this evening, as police have brought two separate hostage incidents to an end. Several explosions were heard at the printing works to the north of Paris, where armed police had been staking out the two main suspects in Wednesday’s Charlie Hebdo newspaper massacre. Five explosions have also been heard at a jewish supermarket in eastern Paris, where several people have been killed. It’s been reported that the gunman has also been killed. I’ll be back later during the 10pm news on BBC One. I hope you canjoin me then. For now, have a very good evening. Does science hold the key to losing weight?

49,BBC News 24,9-jan-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,30 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten: France reflects on a day of violence and loss of life as two hostage crises are brought to an end. North east of Paris a wave of gunfire and explosions at a print factory where two suspected terrorists were taking refuge. The brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi were both killed in the assault. One man being held hostage was saved. In eastern Paris a second siege at a kosher supermarket, where a gunman had taken several people hostage. The gunman was killed. His female accomplice is still on the run. Most of the hostages ran to safety but four were killed as the raid took place. TRANSLATION: My daughter, she’s in the supermarket, she’s with herjewish boyfriend. They went shopping. She called me ten minutes ago. She said, ""Mum, there are dead people."" Parisians have been pausing to remember 17 victims of terrorism in the past few days. And the partner of the magazine editor killed on Wednesday shared her thoughts. Tell the truth to people, it’s a war. 12 people were killed by terrorists. And the other headlines tonight: The radical preacher Abu Hamza is sentenced to life injail by a US court for a string of terror offences. And the first private firm to run an NHS hospital pulls out of its contract - as the health watchdog places the hospital in special measures. On tonight’s BBC London: After the Paris terror attacks - claims that one of the gunmen had links to a mosque in London. And the grandmother who died after waiting hours for an ambulance - her family say the delay was fatal. Good evening from Paris, at the end of a turbulent and extremely challenging day for the people of France. At one stage there were two hostage crises unfolding involving Islamist extremists. Both crises were resolved but innocent lives were lost in the process. The two brothers suspected of killing 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo here in Paris on Wednesday were cornered in a small town north-east of the capital. Cherif and Said Kouachi were both killed in the police operation launched in the early evening. They had taken refuge in a printing unit in Dammartin-en-Goele and a hostage with them escaped unharmed. Meanwhile in eastern Paris a gunman took several hostages inside a kosher supermarket at Vincennes. The police operation freed most of them, but four lost their lives. The gunman was shot dead by police. Our first report tonight is from Dammartin, north of Paris and our Europe editor Gavin Hewitt is there. Today, the French government faced the enormous challenge of dealing with two hostage crises. At the very highest level of the French government, it was decided they had to be ended swiftly, out of fear it might encourage other incidents. The French Prime Minister decided two police operations needed to be launched simultaneously. They almost were and the suspects were killed. Late afternoon in a small French town. GUNFIRE Bursts of gunfire marked the end of a huge manhunt to find the two brothers suspected of killing 12 people at a satirical newspaper. Special forces appeared on the roof of the printing works, where the gunmen had been hiding. There was shooting and explosions. EXPLOSION After a few minutes, silence and the two most wanted men in France were dead and a hostage freed. The day had begun with convoys of police vehicles scouring a busy highway Ao miles from Paris, for Cherif and Said Kouachi, wanted for a terrorist attack at the paper Charlie Hebdo. The gunmen had stolen a car and the police chased them to Dammartin-en-Goele, a town of 8000 people. Helicopters hovered over a printing works where the gunmen had forced their way in, taking a hostage. A salesman visiting the offices happened to meet them, believing at first they were police. He could have been a policeman, if he hadn’t told me they did not kill civilians. They were heavily armed, like special forces members. They had Kalashnikovs. I was outside the door of the office. I shook hands with one of the terrorists, who told me he was from the police and ordered me to leave, as they did not kill civilians, so I left. The town’s residents were ordered to stay indoors. Dammartin isjust a small French town with only a few thousand people. Many of them have been told to stay behind their shutters and outside, on the street, just line after line of police trucks. The only thing we want, this resident told me, is to have a telephone call about our children and how they are. Police officers in body armour began evacuating children from schools, small groups being led out from their classrooms and put on buses. Anxious faces, unaware of the dangers around them. After several hours, the police were able to establish contact with the two gunmen, who were in a building in this industrial estate here, but they told the police they were prepared to die as martyrs. But the police operation here became much more complicated, when it was understood that the two hostage incidents in Paris were links. The two sets of gunmen appeared to know each other, with hostages being seized to barter for the release of the two brothers. The police decided to coordinate their assaults, but before that happened the gunmen burst out of the printing works, firing. Within minutes, Said and Cherif Kouachi was dead and the man in the building was free. Some reports said he had been secretly passing information to the police during the day. TRANSLATION: Today showed the professionalism and courage of our troops. I want to say how grateful the French people are that this has been resolved. Helicopters quickly landed where the two gunmen had been shot. One government minister said, it was the only possible outcome. The president said, we have taken on a war against terrorism. Minutes after the police and military operation in Dammartin, there was turmoil in eastern Paris when security forces stormed a kosher supermarket. A gunman named as Amedyi Coulibaly, apparently helped by a female accomplice called Hayat Boumedienne, took several people hostage and threatened to kill them if security forces moved in. The woman is said to be still at large. The gunman was killed when forces moved in near the Porte de Vincennes. Most of the hostages were freed, but four died. Our Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson is at the scene and we canjoin her now. Things on the surface have largely returned to normal here. It is almost hard to believe that this middle-class Paris neighbourhood was the scene of a violent stand-off earlier today, the scene of a violent stand-off earliertoday, between earlier today, between police and a heavily armed gunman, who had taken hostages in a supermarketjust down there. Five people died in that stand-off, including the gunman himself. Here is how events unfolded in today’s dramatic Paris siege. The message from France’s newest enemies, we can strike anywhere. And nothing says it better than anti-terrorist squads stalking gunman within sight of the Eiffel Tower. The target was a jewish neighbourhood. At lunch time today, a man armed with machine guns walked into this kosher supermarket and took more than a dozen people hostage. Some of them managed to call their family. TRANSLATION: I said, calltheirfamily. TRANSLATION: Isaid, don’t TRANSLATION: I said, don’t call, don’t call, it’s too dangerous. I think she’s in the basement, or a cold storage room, I’m not sure. Too many parents here had to imagine that grief, huddled in a nearby playground, teachers and pupils as the order came to close all local schools. This is the second time today that France has faced a hostage situation in or around the capital. Whether or not they are linked, the ambition of these attackers is clear and it is likely to change the way this country views its security, its safety and its society. Officers named two suspects immense attack, they are also wanted for killing a policewoman in Paris yesterday. 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly, believed to have links to the other hostage-takers. And his girlfriend, Hayat Boumedienne, who was reported to be on the run. With darkness came the police assault. Local media caught the moment when the commandos stormed in. GUNFIRE. They had found the hostage taker praying, they said. A few minutes later, the first glimpse of survivors. Some too small to run for freedom. They already know how precious it can feel. Four hostages died in this attack, along with their capture. Speaking after the siege was over, President Hollande said the threat was not over yet. TRANSLATION: I call for all men and women for France to stand up this Sunday for the values of democracy, flew -- Sunday for the values of democracy, flew -- freedom and pluralism, which are very dear to all of us and which Europe embodies. There is relief here tonight at the end of the extraordinary chapter, but anxiety over how it could happen at all and what tomorrow could bring. More details have been emerging about the brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, the men blamed for Wednesday’s attack, and more is also known about Amedy Coulibaly, the supermarket gunman. Their motives became clearer when Cherif Kouachi called a French television channel claiming he was backed and financed by Al-Qaeda in Yemen. In a separate call, Coulibaly said he was acting for the so-called Islamic State and claimed the two terrorist attacks had been coordinated. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner reports on some of the security questions still to be answered. Young, popular, peaceful. Cherif Kouachi in his days as they would-be rapper. So how did he go from this... To this, a prime suspect in the murder of 12 people in Paris on Wednesday. Cherif lived in this Paris suburb, an orphan of Algerian parents. Here, he reportedly fell under the influence of a radical young preacher. The preacher allegedly showed him and others images from a prison in Iraq, Wareham US soldiers had a bruised some prisoners. -- Iraq, Wareham US soldiers had a bruised some prisoners. -- where you must soldiers had abused some business. -- business. -- business. Kouachi was convicted for trying to recruit jihadists to go to Iraq. Injail, he met this man, Djamel Beghal, convicted of terrorism and links to Al-Qaeda. He had attended Finsbury Park mosque here in London while it was controlled by the radical preacher Abu Hamza. The other Kouachi brother, Said, spent a year in Yemen with extremists, before returning to France. Both brothers were on US and UK no-fly watch lists. Officials have revealed he sneaked in to Yemen illegally and joined with Al-Qaeda. There is a belief in number of Europeans have travelled to Yemen to link up with Al-Qaeda in the peninsular, which is a major transnational terrorist group and an affiliate of Osama Bin Laden’s ideology. They have trained Europeans to take part in terrorism before, but not in Europe itself. This may be the first example in France. Then there is the third gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, who took hostages today in a jewish supermarket in Paris after earlier killing a policewoman. He claimed to be linked to Islamic State. And yet the questions remain. Was Al-Qaeda in Yemen really behind this? Or was it Islamic State? just individuals, inspired by them? Above all, why, when all the suspects were no police, were these outrages not prevented? At the end of this day, details now coming through about the legal process and the kind of investigation that will take place into lots of these complex layers that are involved to stop the public prosecutor in Paris has been speaking. Let’s go back to our Paris correspondent for more details and light being shed on those involved in these incidents? The police are keen to point out how quick they were to identify Amedy Coulibaly. They say they found his DNA on a site yesterday when he was believed to have shot a police officer. They are keen to point out their success, officer. They are keen to point out theirsuccess, because their success, because despite the fact that across France tonight people have great relief that the sieges have ended, there is also a twinge of anxiety. A twinge of anxiety that there may be others plotting to do the same thing, and also anxiety that with so much known about the attackers, who were known to authorities here and abroad, how could this happen at all? Lucy, thank you for the update. Earlier today, the city of Paris honoured the victims of the attacks outside the Hotel de Ville. Among those at the ceremony wasjeannette Bougrab, the partner of the editor of Charlie Hebdo, Stephane Charbonnier. In an interview with the BBC she said her partner was a fighter for freedom and described him as ""a beautiful man"". As France remembered the victims, she spoke to our special correspondent Fergal Keane. In a city traumatised by violence, banners declaring solidarity and defiance. ""Paris is Charlie. We are Charlie"". Grieving friends and relatives were at City Hall. Among them, jeannette Bougrab, widow of the murdered editor, Stephane Charbonnier. An hour before he was attacked, he sent his wife a text saying, ""I love you"". jeannette Bougrab told me how after the attack she had desperately tried to reach her husband’s body. We went to Charlie Hebdo. A lot of policemen in the street. When I arrived, I did not know if my husband was alive or was not alive. People say he has died. And I could not believe that it’s possible because he’s too young. Only 1+7 years old. This was Stephane with colleagues in the newspaper offices. When she arrived, jeannette begged police to be allowed to see his body. I did not want to let my husband alone. I would like to sleep with him. But a lot of police have to do their work. But I did not want to let alone the body of my husband. In his last ever cartoon, Stephane had depicted a fundamentalist warning of attacks on Paris. His widow now wants the state to confront radical Islam. We have to tell the truth to people. It’s a war. 12 people were killed by terrorists. Across France, Muslim clerics were asked to condemn the violence at Friday prayers. At the Grand Mosque in Paris, there was strong security and sympathy for the victims of extremist violence. ""We are disgusted by what is happening,"" this young man said. ""They are not an example for Muslims. They are murderers, assassins and madmen"". At City Hall today, a promise to protect the democratic values of the republic, but also from the widow of a murdered editor. Will you fight on for freedom of speech? I will stay in France and fight forfreedom. But I know that I could be killed by a terrorist. It’s possible in France. Welcome to France. So I am very... I think... I just want to cry. Fergal Keane, BBC News, Paris. jeannette Bougrab speaking to Fergal Keane earlier today. More from Paris before the end of the programme, speaking to three young Paris Iams who will be sharing their reflections of the past few days and sharing their hopes and fears for the future of France. In the meantime, back to you. The radical Islamist preacher Abu Hamza has been sentenced to life imprisonment by an American court for a series of terror offences. He was convicted last year of a number of crimes - aiding the abduction of Western hostages in Yemen, and trying to set up an Al-Qaeda training camp in the US. Today, we heard that he was also linked to one of the gunmen in Paris. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, reports from New York. With events in Paris still unfolding, security had been noticeably tighter this morning outside the New York courthouse where the Muslim cleric Abu Hamza was being sentenced. The firebrand cleric had been convicted last summer for a string of terror offences. Today, he was facing judgement. In court, he insisted he was innocent and complained about his treatment. But his tone and demeanour could not have been more different. Abu Hamza cut a forlorn figure in court today, pleading for leniency in sentencing, pleading to be put in a medical facility rather than a high security prison. But the judge was having none of it. She said he had shown no remorse and that were he to be freed, he would do the same again. The judge gave him life, saying she could not think of a time when it would be safe to release him. Abu Hamza was initially seen as something of a pantomime villain. That changed after 9/11. Other young Muslims were being radicalised and alarm grew. This man was paid by MI5 to spy on Abu Hamza. Today, he had this message for the convicted terrorist. You are going to serve your sentence here. But you, exceptionally, you still have to face justice with God. Don’t think that you are going to heaven. Never, ever. There is no place for you there. After his extradition to the US to stand trial he was convicted of supporting terrorists and hostage taking in Yemen back in 1998. Lawrence Whitehouse and his wife, Margaret, were part of a group seized by Islamists linked to Abu Hamza. He was rescued but his wife was killed. It has been a long time coming, that he has been tried and found guilty in the United States for a crime that he should probably have been prosecuted in Britain and could have been over probably a decade ago. Nearly 12 years on from the first raid on the Finsbury Park Mosque, the legal road has finally reached its end, and Abu Hamza will spend the rest of his life in prison. jon Sopel, BBC News, New York. The first deal for a private company to run an NHS hospital has collapsed. The private firm Circle took on the struggling Hinchingbrooke Trust in Cambridgeshire in 2012. But it’s now ending its ten-year contract early, claiming that cuts and pressure on the casualty department had driven up costs. The announcement came hours before the NHS watchdog in England placed Hinchingbrooke in special measures, saying safety and leadership were inadequate. Here’s Hugh Pym. At a crossroads, the role of the private sector in the NHS. Hinchingbrooke was the first NHS hospital to be run by a commercial operator. Now that company, Circle, says it will pull out because it can’t make the sums add up. Further investment, over and above the 1+.8 million we have already invested from Circle’s resources, and considerable manpower, will be required going forward, and that is not appropriate for a small, employee-owned organisation like circle. But unions are saying, ""We told you so"". When you look at the contract to begin with, Circle made unrealistic claims that they could reduce the deficit and at the same time provide profits to shareholders. We always said that was not achievable. Circle’s announcement came hours before the regulator, the Care Quality Commission, said it had rated Hinchingbrooke as inadequate. The company disagreed with the findings. The hospital will now be put into a special measures monitoring regime. This is a critical report and we are critical of the safety, caring and leadership at this hospital. And we are critical of the care given in the A&E department, and also on the medical and surgical wards. The company said rising patient numbers in Accident & Emergency was another factor behind its decision. The latest weekly figures across England showed another fall in the percentage seen within four hours. Hinchingbrooke was seen very much as a test case for the involvement of a private provider in the running of an NHS hospital. Today’s development will intensify the debate over whether it is going to be possible and desirable across wider areas of the health service. The direction of travel under successive governments has been for more NHS services to be outsourced to private providers. That has proved controversial but it is not clear that Hinchingbrooke, which had major financial problems before private management was brought in, will lead to a change of course. I am not sure you can draw that much of a conclusion from this case, because it was always going to be difficult to make this work. But I do think the embarrassment of this withdrawal will make people think carefully about this particular solution for dealing with failing hospitals. Ministers say they are disappointed but point out the Hinchingbrooke contract process started under the last government. Labour say it is a blow for the coalition, as the deal was signed in 2011. The future of the hospital is not clear, and neither is the debate about the role of private finance in the health service. Hugh Pym, BBC News. Hurricane-force winds left tens of thousands of homes in Scotland without power and have caused widespread travel disruption. The strongest gusts were recorded in the Islands reaching 113mph in Stornoway. Power companies are still working to restore electricity to 75,000 properties tonight. The Stephen Hawking film, The Theory of Everything, has been shortlisted in the four main categories at this year’s BAFTAs. As well as nominations for Best Film and Director, Eddie Redmayne and Felicityjones, who play Professor Hawking and his first wife, jane, are in the running for Best Actor and Best Actress. They’ll be up against Rosamund Pike for Gone Girl, Benedict Cumberbatch for his portrayal of Alan Turing in the Imitation Game, and Ralph Fiennes for The Grand Budapest Hotel, the film with the most nominations, at 11. Let’s go back now to our main story, the events in France, and to Huw, who’s in Paris for us. Here in Paris, people are reflecting on 17 lives lost at the hands of terrorists in the past few days, 12 of them on Wednesday at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. President Hollande has asked the public for a massive show of solidarity on Sunday at a rally in central Paris, and the authorities are expecting one of the biggest crowds this city has seen for many years. I spoke to three people hoping to be there. They shared their thoughts with me earlier this evening. We met just after they had finished work, three young Parisians of different backgrounds, openly expressing fear about the future and the potential backlash for France’s significant Muslim community. I think the consequences are going to be great when it comes to the Muslim community. People are going to see this community as part of this, when actually they have nothing to do with it. There are two options. I am French but my parents are from Tunisia. So obviously, I don’t want to be like a victim. Because I think the victim today is freedom of speech. When the country is shocked like that, we have to keep solidarity. And we have to be a real country. We have to build something. People are going to get confused between immigration and what happened here. I think the media has a big role to play in this. So I’m going to observe, going to watch very closely what is going to happen with the media right now. Because they have a big responsibility tojust be careful and be very balanced and show the difference between religion, the community of Muslims and, you know, events going on. Our Europe editor Gavin Hewitt joins us from Dammartin. Gavin, still details coming in, knew liked being shared on today’s events. Yes. Even whilst we have been on air we have been hearing that the Kouachi brothers had spoken with the gun men in Paris on over 500 occasions. Also more details about what happened here. It has been confirmed that the Kouachi brothers came out firing. Also that one police officer was injured, and that an employee was released to have been hiding in the building. Now to the wider picture. President Hollande made out today that the threat that the French people were facing was not finished, was not over, he said. He said it is a war, but not a war against religion. And a lot of the emphasis will now be on a huge rally expected on Sunday, a rally for unity against violence. David Cameron will be there, Angela Merkel, very much in Europe’s leaders shoulder. But of course, finding an answerto leaders shoulder. But of course, finding an answer to fanaticism and extremism is a tougher challenge. Thank you, Gavin Hewitt. That’s all from Paris tonight, at the end of day which brought an end to two hostage crises and a major terrorist threat. 17 innocent lives lost this week but determination to make the strongest possible statement for unity and solidarity at the rally this Sunday. Now the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. It’s been claimed tonight that one of the two gunmen suspected of carrying out the terror attack in Paris this week had links to a mosque in north London. Cherif Kouachi was killed this afternoon by police in France, but it’s believed he’d been mentored by a member of Al-Qaeda who operated out of Finsbury Park Mosque. It’s the same mosque used by the extremist preacher, Abu Hamza, who has been sentenced to life in prison today in America for terrorism offences. Nick Beake reports. Worshippers in Finsbury Park today remembered the victims of the Paris attacks in their prayers and condemned the killers. Evil people, evil people - they don’t belong in our society. Others defended the right to criticise religions. We have a right to express ours elves on anything. ",,

Worshippers in Finsbury Park today remembered the victims of the Paris attacks in their prayers and condemned the killers. Evil people, evil people - they don’t belong in our society. Others defended the right to criticise religions. We have a right to express ours elves on anything. It doesn’t mean if somebody says something to you, you have to be bad and kill people - it’s unacceptable. But the legacy of Abu Hamza and the radical brand of Islam he once preached here has brought the mosque back into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. This was one of his lieutenants in North London - Djamel Beghal. He was laterjailed in France. It was claimed today he was a mentor in prison to one of the suspected Paris murderers, Cherif Kouachi. The allegation was made by this former MI5 spy, who infiltrated the mosque in the late ‘90s. Reda Hassaine told a national newspaper, there is no doubt you can see the influence of the teachings in him - what happened in Paris was the legacy of Abu Hamza. These claims come of course on the day that Abu Hamza, the former imam here at Finsbury Park Mosque, was sentenced in New York for terrorism offences. It may well have been more than ten years since he last preached here, but the current leadership is concerned that the mosque has now been linked with the Paris killings. I feel upset and the community, all our community feel upset, for us, because our name has been mentioned in the media, so we have to take extra precautions and be more careful about how we deal with this matter in terms of security and other things. There is also frustration that despite ten years of different leadership here, the old regime still casts a shadow. The mosque is a completely different story at the moment, if you compare it with what it has been before 2005. I mean, I can refer to it as an era of community cohesion, instead of an era of hostile cohesion, when it was before 2005. A sentiment reinforced by the local MP. Abu Hamza is long gone from this building. This is a good example of what a good religious institution and organisation can do, to bring about peace and understanding between faiths and groups. As a judge in America sentences Abu Hamza to life behind bars, Finsbury Park Mosque wants to consign him to history, but it seems the hatred he cultivated in London years ago could have been channelled into the brutal assault on France this week. Two men, who got into a gun fight with firearms officers in north London earlier this year, have been jailed for a total of 27 years. Sedat Meric was carrying out a revenge attack on the West Green Road Pool Hall - with his accomplice Oktay Ayanoglu. The court heard Meric fired into a bar before turning the gun on armed officers and firing eight rounds. Nobody was injured. A 65-year-old man who abused young boys in south west London in the 1970s and ‘80s has been jailed for four years. Charles Worth - formerly known as David Berry - carried out the attacks at a number of locations including Morden swimming pool. He was arrested in February at Gatwick Airport. The daughter of a 92-year-old grandmother who died after waiting a total of 19 hours to be seen by a medical team believes her mother would be alive today, if she’d been seen earlier. Bridgette Forde died in December after a fall at her home in Muswell Hill. Helen Forde has been speaking to our reporter, Marc Ashdown. There are sympathy cards everywhere in the very room where 92-year-old Bridgette Forde fell and broke her hip. Her daughter called an ambulance and waited five hours, helpless, then 14 hours in A&E. She feels the care her mother received to save her in truth contributed to her death. I loved my mother completely and to lose Mum, though she was 92, that’s awful, but the thought that that loss could have been avoided and the linking of the lying on the floor for those five hours with the pneumonia and with her death, that is what I’ve got a problem with. I’m notjust grieving for Mum. I’m actually thinking about if we’d left the hospital, if she hadn’t... I’m left with a load of ifs. What isn’t in doubt is that hospitals across London are struggling to cope. Many A&Es have been well below the target of seeing patients within four hours. The London Ambulance Service has apologised. They say they are taking up to 5000 calls a day at the moment and have to prioritise people in immediately life-threatening conditions. I hate it, I’m a doctor, I’m a GP, I care for people like that, so it’s tragic and my sympathies go to her family. That is not the kind of performance we want to see. But we are making our services better. We want to provide world-class care and most of the time we do that. The nursing staff care, the doctors care, but they are overstretched, they’re overworked, there’s a quick turnover in beds. How can you cope in a situation like that? That’s it from me. Sonja jessop will be back with the weekend news tomorrow, but now the weather with Matt. Strong winds up in Scotland. Is it heading our way? Not as strong as up there, tomorrow is a topsy-turvy day.

Europe’s law enforcement agency, Europol, says it wants greater co-operation between national police forces to counter the threat from Islamist extremists. It said the murder of 17 people in Paris and the foiling of an alleged plot in Belgium to kill police officers showed that Europe was facing its most difficult challenge for many years. Rob Broomby reports. A show of strength on the streets, Belgium’s soldiers patrolling key locations as Europe waits for the latest threat. Here is in France the military are lending support. Five people have been charged for participating in terrorist activity following a series of raids in which two suspected Islamist militants were killed. Money, guns, and explosives were seized as well as fake police uniforms. Europol is warning that the threat is evolving as battle hardened fighters from Syria seek targets closer to home. They say are dealing with many thousands of potential terrorists. They are largely unconnected, many of them don’t have a history of coming to the authority’s attention, so this is a more difficult one to contend with. In Washington David Cameron and Barack Obama stood shoulder to shoulder, determined to defeat what the Prime Minister called a poisonous and fanatical ideology. Europe has been convulsed by last week’s terrorist attacks. jewish leaders closed schools on Friday in both Antwerp and Brussels after hearing they were potential targets. In Britain the terrorism threat remains at the second highest level, severe. Security has been boosted injewish neighbourhoods to reassure a community made nervous by Islamist rhetoric and the attacks in Paris. In Britain and across the continent the police remain on high alert. A man has appeared in court in Oxford today charged over a spate of arson attacks on Thursday. lI7-year-old Andrew Main from Wallingford is accused in relation to fires in Crowmarsh Gifford and Roke Marsh. The blazes hit South Oxfordshire Council offices, a funeral parlour and a thatched cottage. Pope Francis faced gale-force winds and torrential rain to hold an open-air Mass in the Philippine city of Tacloban, devastated by Typhoon Haiyan just over a year ago. However, he cut his visit short by several hours due to the tropical storm threatening to trap him on the island. One woman was killed after the Mass when a platform blew over. From Tacloban, Rupert Wingfield Hayes reports. As he stepped off his plane in Tacloban in foul weather, Pope Francis immediately donned the same cheap plastic rain poncho being worn by the huge crowds waiting to welcome him. Pope Francis told then he had come because people have suffered and lost so much in Typhoon Haiyanjust over a year suffered and lost so much in Typhoon Haiyan just over a year ago.

As he made his way into town, tens of thousands more came out, despite the horrible weather. Here comes the Pope -- despite the horrible weather. Here comes the Pope -- Popemobile. It is cold and wet and miserable, everyone is soaked to the skin but no one really cares. Everyone in Tacloban knows they will probably never get to see a Pope here again in their lifetimes. The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, has poured scorn on a call by David Cameron for companies that have profited from falling oil prices to pass on the benefits to their workers in the form of wage increases. In a speech in London, Mr Miliband accused Mr Cameron of pre-election pleading. Our Political Correspondent Tom Barton is there for us now. Tom, what more can you tell us? This speech was Ed Miliband’s attempt to take the economic argument to the Conservatives, accusing them of complacency and denial on the issue of living standards. The issue came as David Cameron suggested that companies that benefited from falling oil prices should pass some of their increased profit on to employees in the shape of increased wages. Ed Miliband said those comments showed that David Cameron was finally accepting that there is a cost of living crisis. We now hear that the Prime Minister thinks Britain needs a pay rise. I tell you, people across the country are choking on their cornflakes. This is someone who has spent months and years telling us there is no cost of living crisis, and if there ever was one, it has been fixed. You could not make it up. So, what is Labour’s response and what is Labour’s policy? They say the only way of bringing down the deficit successfully is by doing what they are suggesting and addressing the cost of living crisis.

Tha nkfully Thankfully the weather this weekend is not as disruptive as that seen in south-west Scotland last night but we will still have a few wintry showers around. We will stick with the cold theme. The blue on the chart is where the rain has been falling, the white is where there has been snow. We have seen the first flakes of the winter pushing across southern parts of England too, bringing a dusting of snow here and there, but there is a lot of dry and sunny weather to come. There could be some sleet or snow on the tops of the Moors. A cold day but the wind is not as strong and we still have the showers feeding in across the west of England and onto the Pennines this afternoon. The showers will lose their intensity, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland there will be fewer showers this afternoon compared with the morning. Slippery roads and pavements will be the biggest hazard in Scotland, but for those going to the Burnley match there will be some wintryness here. Nothing too significant, to the south a lot more cloud and not as cold. Rain fora south a lot more cloud and not as cold. Rain for a time, and that will gradually clever way into Sunday morning. With the wind in a northerly direction tomorrow, this time it is into the east of England, bringing some showers on the wintry side, but for most it will be a dry, sunny and cold afternoon. What follows is a particularly cold Sunday night. Get yourself out into the countryside and it will be a good deal colder, possibly as ",,

At St Pancras this afternoon, the queues were building up, with all services cancelled and trains already on their way turned around mid-journey. It started at 11:25am, deep under the Channel. You wrote an’s alarms sounded after detecting smoke coming from a lorry on a train. -- smoke coming from a lorry on a train. -- you wrote on all’s alarms. Ben was on board. Smoke started coming through on board. We had to put the masks on and evacuate from a train into a safe room. Nobody knew what was going on. We were in there for probably 1+5 minutes before a coach came and took us to a anger where everybody had a medical. Within minutes, all trains were stopped. At Ashford in Kent, Eurotunnel’s services waited with nowhere to go. In London, we found a woman who had surprised her husband with a 30th birthday trip to Paris, only to get sent back again. You plan it for a few months and then you pack and get ready and even get onto the train and unfortunately, as we approached the tunnel, we were told there were delays due to smoke and we were heading back to London. Eurostar aren’t saying how many people are affected by this but Saturday is one of the busiest travelling days and 26 trains in all have been cancelled. Thousands, not just here in London but also in Paris, Brussels and elsewhere, are trying to work out how they will complete theirjourney. Back in 2008, a fire in the tunnel disrupted services for months while repairs were carried out. Since then, safety measures have been brought in and they helped to contain today’s incident. This evening in Kent, lorries heading for the Channel are still part up but Eurotunnel has just said some services will start again as early as tonight. Let’s go live now to St Pancras and our correspondent there, Daniel Boettcher. Daniel, a real headache for passengers - what’s the latest? Well, things have calmed down a great deal here. Earlier, passengers were queueing up outside the building along the pavement, as they waited for more information and tried to read book their tickets. Inside, there are still groups of people with their luggage, many trying to get accommodation for tonight. They’re being doing this leaflet, which apologises for the inconvenience and explains how they can get refunds for their tickets and claim compensation for hotel, taxi or food costs. and claim compensation for hotel, taxi orfood costs. As to and claim compensation for hotel, taxi or food costs. As to what happens next, although Eurotunnel says that freight and car services will resume tonight, passengers here won’t know until tomorrow and are being advised to check online. Around 300 Belgian soldiers are being deployed to protect buildings across the country which might be targets for terrorist attack. It comes as the law enforcement agency Europol warned that the continent’s police forces are struggling to contain the threat from Islamist extremists. From Brussels, Robert Hall reports. The message is clear that soldiers on patrol in Belgian cities for the first in three decades. Here, they are protecting a jewish community in Antwerp as other units deployed to other potential terrorist targets in this city and in the Belgian capital. The Belgian government is stressing it will increase the deployment in response to any new threat. TRANSLATION: We are here to ensure that Belgian law is being respected on the streets and we need weapons for that as well and an application of legal violence. And our’s drive towards the German border, this town is still awaiting formal identification of the two men who died in this apartment building. Outside, a neighbourtold me the men who lived in the flat had aroused suspicions. TRANSLATION: Several of them were always coming and going. I didn’t like the look of them. They made me feel wary. It was bizarre. As investigations widen, the police agency Europol has spoken of its concern at the number of potential terrorists and their sophisticated planning. Many of them maybe don’t have a history of coming to authorities’ attention so this is a critical threat and a more difficult one than we’ve seen for many years. Today’s troop deployments, alongside the increased threat level across Europe, may raise public awareness and public confidence but the pressure on police and intelligence services to analyse the information they gathered from last week’s operations to identify further terrorist cells is unrelenting. Robert Hall, BBC News, Brussels. France is warning its citizens in the west African state of Niger to stay indoors following violent demonstrations held in the capital, Niamey. The protests are over the cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad appearing on the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine. Four people - including a police officer- have been killed, and at least two churches have been set alight. A man has appeared in court accused of a spate of arson attacks in South Oxfordshire on Thursday. 1+7-year-old Andrew Main from Roke Marsh was remanded in custody. He’s been charged in connection with three major fires at the local council offices, a funeral parlour, and a thatched cottage. Pope Francis has held an open-air Mass in high winds and torrential rain in the Philippines city of Tacloban - which was devastated by Typhoon Haiyanjust over a year ago. One woman was killed when scaffolding blew over at today’s service. Our religious affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, sent this report from Tacloban. No mere storm could stop them. The people of Tacloban have endured far worse. They came in their hundreds of thousands to see Pope Francis celebrate Mass, buffeted by the winds. Peace be with you. And wearing the same yellow raincoat as the crowds. He’s the first world leader to visit since Typhoon Haiyan caused so much suffering and loss of life. The Pope came here to offer comfort to the people of Tacloban. He thanked people locally, and the international community, for the help they gave when so many lives were devastated here by the typhoon, but he said that the needs remain great and he asked the international community to continue to help. For the youngest survivors of the typhoon, he offered blessings and words of hope for the future. And for those waiting patiently at the cathedral, the Pope’s presence here, however brief, was enough. But with the weather closing in fast, Pope Francis was clearly a man in a hurry, apologising to the congregation that he’d have to leave early or the storm would ground him here. Because I have to go now. The forecast was right. The pontiff’s plane, with us and the rest of the media on board, took off safely. Pope Francis was happy to have met those who’d suffered so much but sad to leave in haste. But it wasn’t a moment too soon. The storm forced the plane behind us to skid off the runway, crashing into the grass behind. It must’ve felt like a miracle inside that nobody was killed or injured. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News, Tacloban. Football, and Chelsea maintained their lead at the top of the Premier League with a 5-0 win over Swansea. Meanwhile, in the Championship, Nottingham Forest left it late to beat rivals Derby County. Patrick Gearey reports. Brian Clough’s name is engraved on East Midlands football. For Derby and Nottingham Forest, Clough means cups. It all seems so long ago, especially for forest. Henri Lansbury’s own goal typical of a season where nothing is coming the way it should for Stuart Pearce’s side. Derby, meanwhile, are playing with drive and purpose. jamie Ward exemplified it. Dorus de Vries’s acrobatics kept him out. The match may have turned in a moment. Forest’s Britt Assombalonga was out by fractions. Small margins are magnified under pressure. The second half had the feel of a last stand by Pearce’s embattled side. Frantic and yet somehow fruitful. Sometimes you just need a break, and a finish as sure as Assombalonga’s. Pride restored, suddenly Forest were about more than saving face. Ben Osborn had never scored before. A flash of inspiration and salvation. The reaction Pearce was famous for as a player. The man once known as Psycho has earned a sequel. That’s it - we’re back with the late news at 10.05pm. ",,

Services are brought to a stop by a lorry fire, leading to lengthy delays at St Pancras. Passengers stranded in the tunnel described the drama. All of a sudden, smoke started coming through from the top. We had had masks on. Nobody knew what was going on. After a day of frustration for travellers, Eurostar says services will be restored tomorrow. Also on the programme, in Belgium, hundreds of soldiers are deployed to protect against terror attacks, as police in Greece arrest four suspects. A record take-up for pensioner bonds, as more than a billion pounds-worth of the new savings product are sold in two days. And thousands turn out in the Philippines for a flying visit from Pope Francis, but bad weather forces him to leave early. Because I have to go now. BOOING Good evening. Services through the Channel Tunnel will be restored tomorrow say operators, after a lorry fire forced their suspension today. Eurostar stopped all trains to and from the Continent, leading to widespread disruption for passengers in London and in Paris. Eurotunnel car and freight services between Folkestone and Calais were also affected. Let’s go now to our correspondent, Matthew Price, who’s outside St Pancras Station. Officials are still inside the Channel tunnel trying to assess the damage. Eurotunnel say they don’t believe any damage is significant, and they are also telling us that none of the A2 people evacuated from the affected train were injured. Today, one of those people, a passenger on board, has given us a gripping account of what it was like deep underneath the English Channel, as smoke began to fill the train. St Pancras this afternoon, the queues were building up with all services cancelled and trains already on their way turned around mid-journey. It started at 11:25am. French Fire crews were called in. Then Lawton was on board. All of a sudden smoke came in from the front, the train was full of smoke, we had to put the masks on. We were evacuated into a safe room, no one knew what was going on, they did not tell us anything. We were in there for probably 1+5 minutes before a coach came and took us to a hangar where everyone had a medical. Do you know what is going on? No. There is a fire in the tunnel. In Calais, passengers were diverted on? No. There is a fire in the tunnel. In Calais, passengers were diverted onto ferries, many facing huge delays. While in London, we found a 30th birthday surprise for her husband, a trip to Paris. They didn’t even been planning it for a fewer months, we packed and got ready, even got onto the Eurostar train, and unfortunately as we approached the tunnel we were told there were delays due to smoke. Then we were heading back to London. Eurostar not saying how many people are affected, but Saturday is one of the busiest travelling days. Thousands, notjust here in the end but also in Paris, Brussels and elsewhere, are now trying to work out how they are going to complete theirjourney. Back in 2008, if I ever tunnel disrupted services for months while repairs were carried out. Since then, safety measures have been brought in. They helped to contain today’s incident. This evening in Kent, lorries heading for the Channel are still parked up but the tunnel is due to reopen the night. The latest information we are getting on exactly what happened is from Eurotunnel. They are saying that there was something inside a trailer on a lorry on that train that was smouldering, but they say there were no flames, there was no fire, simply smoke. Presumably that is why they don’t believe there are significant damage to the tunnel, thatis significant damage to the tunnel, that is why they are also confident that in the coming hours they will run at least a fuel freight trains, presumably, through the tunnel. And -- run at least a fuel. They expect services to resume possibly with some delays at first but getting back to normal pretty swiftly. Thank you. Around three hundred soldiers are being deployed to protect buildings across Belgium which might be targets for terrorist attack. Tonight, officials in Greece said they’d detained four suspected Islamist extremists, including one who’s alleged to have been the leader of a Belgian terror cell. From Brussels, Robert Hall reports. The message is clear, soldiers on patrol in Belgian cities for the first time in three decades.

For that, they need weapons as well. They need the application of legal violence which will happen if necessary. An hour’s drive towards the German border, this town is still waiting for formal identification of the two men who died in this bullet-scarred apartment building on Wednesday evening. ~ -- Thursday - - Thursday evening. Outside, a neighbour told me that the men who lived in the flat aroused suspicions. TRANSLATION: Several of them, always coming and going, I did not like the look of them, they made me feel wary. It was bizarre. Today, four more suspects were detained in the Greek capital, Athens. They are being held at the Central police headquarters.

As investigations widen, they have spoken of the concern about terrorists and sophisticated planning. ~ -- Euro poll have spoken. Today’s troop deployments alongside the increased threat level across Europe may raise public awareness and public confidence, but the pressure on police and intelligence services to analyse the information they have gathered from last week’s operations and to identify further terrorist cells is unrelenting. France is warning its citizens in the west African state of Niger to stay indoors following violent demonstrations in the capital, Niamey. The protests are over the cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad appearing on the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine. Five people, including a police officer, have been killed, and at least seven churches have been set alight. In eastern Ukraine, clashes between the army and pro-Russian rebels at Donetsk airport have intensified, with reports of explosions, heavy gunfire and least six people killed. Amateur drone footage shows the extent of the damage at the airport, which has been the focus of months of on-off fighting. Violence has flared in the region in recent days, with peace talks stalled, and a September truce in shreds. The Treasury says more than a billion pounds-worth of new Pensioner Bonds have been sold since they became available two days ago. The government-backed savings products offer people aged 65 and over a better interest rate than they can get in banks and building societies. Here’sjoe Lynam. We all like to maximise our incomes, no matter how old we are. Now the over 65s have a new way to earn money from their savings and they are the fastest selling financial product ever. But what are they exactly? Pension bonds are just the same as saving accounts, except you can’t withdraw any money until the term is up. There are two types of accounts, a one-year bond with 2.8% annual interest, before tax, which you can get at the end of that year. Or a three-year bond which pays 4% annual interest, but again you are locked in the that time. You can’t save more than £10,000 for each bond, or £20,000 per person. In the opening two days alone, 120,000 people invested in pension bonds, and the reason was clear the many at this market in Leeds. The three years, you are getting a better return on what you get on almost everything else in the some of the interest rates are ridiculous, 0.5%, when you are getting four percent, what more can you ask? It is the best rate around, savings rates are really low for our age group. It is more difficult to find the right ones. Luckily, the government have come up with something at least reasonable this time. Although older savers love the new bonds, for others, weighing up where to invest their savings is yet another example of the favourable treatment given to pensioners. It is a great dealfor treatment given to pensioners. It is a great deal for pensioners but a terrible dealfor a great deal for pensioners but a terrible deal for taxpayers. Too often throughout this coalition we have seen austerity stop at age 65, and we have not seen tough choices above that age level we have seen in other areas. above that age level we have seen in otherareas. Up other areas. Up to £10 billion can be saved with pensioner bonds, and the government says almost a million people could end up with one, earning way more than younger â8I’I’IiI’Ig Way ITIOFE li’I8I’I yOUI’IgâI’ SBVEFS.

With all the sport, here’s Karthi Gnanasegaram at the BBC Sport Centre. 21 goals scored in football’s Premier League, five of them by the same team. It is time to pop out of the room if you are waiting to see the goals on Match of the Day which follows soon on BBC One. The Chelsea managerjose Mourinho held his side’s perfect game after Oscar, Diego Costa and Andre Shelford five past Swansea without reply, extending their lead at the top of the table to five points. Crystal Palace came from two goals down to beat Burnley 3-2. Southampton stay in third place with a two minus winner at Newcastle. Manchester United winner at Newcastle. Manchester United were 2-0 winners at QPR. In the Scottish Premiership, leaders Aberdeen drew 3-3 with Dundee, which means Celtic are nowjust two points behind them, after they beat Hamilton 2-0. Adam Matthews and Liam Henderson with a goal in each half. Elsewhere, a late goal ensured St Mirren, who played most of the second half with ten men, beat Ross County. Stjohnstone were second half with ten men, beat Ross County. St johnstone were winners over Partick Thistle. Heather Watson has won her second WTA tour title. The 22-year-old did not rob a set all week as she became the Hobart International champion, and she is the first British 30 years to win two tour titles and climbs to a career-high 38th in the rankings, head of the Australian Open, which doubts on Monday -- did not drop a set. A big win for wasps in rugby union, as they beat harlequins 23-3 at the Stoop to move to second place in pool two. Saracens powered past Munster in pool one. Nattering before the battering. There has been much talk about this fixture, but with continued European rugby on the line, words would only go so far. Wasps began quietly, letting Harlequins make the effort before picking their moment to interject. Christian Wade was allowed a salt over the Stoop. Some important time in the spotlight, with England’s Six Nations selection in the week. Quins continued to have most of the ball. joe Simpson ran Wasps towards a 17- 0/2-time lead. Harlequins never gave up the lead but every alleyway they explored had a Wasp covering it. They must find the energy from somewhere for their final crucial pool match. Munster are always noisy guests, but red flags proved red rags to Saracens. Their forwards’s charging earned enough space for their backs to show. Wing Chris Ashton especially enjoys that. The Sarries will get their big finish. Or nothing next week at Clermont. Five times champion Ronnie O’Sullivan has been beaten in the semifinals of snooker’s Masters by the world number one, snooker’s Masters by the world numberone, Neil number one, Neil Robertson force of his 6-1 victory brought O’Sullivan’s 15 match winning run to an end.

Fancy footwork indeed. That is all from the sports centre for now. That’s it, but before we go, just to say the Deputy Prime Mininster Nick Clegg will be a guest on the Andrew Marr Show at nine o’clock, tomorrow morning, here on BBC One. From all of the team here, goodbye! The cold weather is set to stay with us well into next week. Some further opportunities for snow as well. It has been coming down this evening across parts of greater Manchester and Yorkshire with a light covering in places and further wintry showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland overnight. A fume or centimetres particularly the hills. To the south perhaps some sleet and snow around. Don’t be surprised to encounter a few flakes, one or two misty hatches overnight as well. And I see start for Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland, as we go through the morning. The last of any overnight rain, sleet and a little bit of snow clearing away from Eastern counties will brighten up after a cloudy start. A cold start, yes, but there will be some crisp sunshine for many of us tomorrow, if you escape those wintry showers, which will continue to come into northern Scotland on a northerly wind, and run down Eastern coastal counties of England late in the day. Still this zone of thick cloud, reaching into Wales, fizzling out as it moves into the Midlands late in the day. Any sunshine does nothing for the damages. They will be very cold on Sunday night, snow on the ground, heavier parts of northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, minus double digits for you as Monday begins.

Belgium is on high alert after a major anti-terror raid in which two suspected Islamist militants were sot dead. militants were shot dead. Prosecutors believe the raid in the eastern town of Verviers foiled a plot to attack police stations. Officials say the suspects had recently returned from Syria, but stress there’s no direct link to last week’s attacks in Paris which left 17 people dead. In France this morning, the US Secretary of State john Kerry, has laid wreaths at the sites where they died, and 12 people have been arrested overnight in connection with the attacks. Christian Fraser is in Paris for us now, Christian. It has been a sad day for funerals for those who were murdered last week. The French President has called for a firm and collective response from the international community in the wake of those attacks, which claimed the lives of 17 people. Certainly we have seen that in the course of the last 24 hours. More than two dozen suspects rounded up, here in France, in Belgium and in Germany. In Brussels, Belgian prosecutors say they foiled an attack by militants aimed at killing police. Bearing the scars, the scene of last night’s gun battle that left two terror suspects dead and another injured and in custody. A security cordon as uneasy local residents in this otherwise sleepy provincial Belgian town were coming to terms with what happened here. TRANSLATION: I am afraid of walking around the town knowing there are still jihadis who are going to come back. That they are jihadis who are going to squat in houses or whatever here or elsewhere. The crack of gunfire during last night’s dramatic shoot out, one of a dozen raids the authorities have said they carried out to dismantle a terror network planning an imminent terror attack. The suspects had recently returned from Syria according to the authorities, as they gave the latest details on what they had uncovered at the scene. We found several weapons. Among them were four AK-47s, Kalashnikovs, several small fire weapons, firearms, munition and explosives. Moreover, we found several police uniforms, material for communication, walkie-talkies and radios, mobile cell phones, false documents and an important amount of money. Tight security at the police headquarters. The countries on its second-highest alert level but it has long been on edge. Hundreds of people from Belgium, more per head per population than any other country, have followed the jihadist trail to Syria. After what happened in Paris I do not have the feeling that Europe is safe. I am not that surprised, but I am a bit concerned knowing that one can walk around with weapons of war like that. Amid wider European jitters, police raids in Germany, but here the suspicion is of planning for an attack in Syria, not on German soil. A VIEW W8I’I’IiI’Ig OI’I A new warning on the challenges of countering this threat. It is very difficult for us to talk about identifying terrorist cells or networks. It is much more complex, much less predictable than that. That takes the challenge of continuing this threat to a new level. What happens may have averted another Paris. The Belgium Government has announced new anti-terror measures. In Belgium and beyond, the authorities are still grappling with all that has unfolded in the past week. Anna, you were at that press conference with prosecutors this morning. What have we learnt about the operations that were mounted? Well, it was very well planned in terms of the jihadist suspects. We have heard some disturbingment detailfrom the have heard some disturbingment detail from the authorities here. They talked about finding AK-47 machine guns and police uniforms. They believe these suspects were planning attacks in police stations and on police officers on the street. These men had recently returned from Syria. There have been 13 arrests - returned from Syria. There have been 13 arrests - a total of 13 arrest - across the country to try and disrupt this network. What we have heard from the director of Europol is the terror threat is so significant in Europe that it will be extremely difficult to foil all of the attacks. Thank you very much. Well, here in Paris, the US Secretary of State has made a statement in the hotel de-Ville behind me in the past hour. He visited the sites of the terror attack last week. He visited the President at the palace. The President said, you have been victims yourself of an exceptional terrorist attack on September 11th, so you know what it means for a country like ours. Well, Paris of course is still on its highest security alert. Earlierthis course is still on its highest security alert. Earlier this morning one of the busiest train stations here in Paris was emptied and evacuated after a bomb threat. One million people were joined in Paris to march the President. There was no senior figure from the American administration. Nonetheless john Kerry is a crucial ally. It is suggested that intelligence shared between the two countries this past week might have averted another attack in Belgium. On the day of the living nightmare that began at Charlie Hebdo, I had a chance to share a few thoughts with you from back home in Washington and today I really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of Paris and all of France. France needs some love. A week on, 120,000 soldiers and policemen are still in place. Overnight, 12 people suspected of involvement in the Charlie Hebdo attacks were brought in for questioning. They are hunting for a man who drove to the supermarket shooting, perhaps the same man who used his pea to attack a jogger last Wednesday in Paris. One of the main stations here in Paris was evacuated in a false alarm. There is nothing hollow about the scale of threat that France faces. A week on from the Charlie Hebdo attacks, senior politicians are gravely concerned about what they have been told and the country’s readiness to tackle it. The former Europe minister was involved in the writing of the terror Bill, the French Parliament recently approved. These guys were in the list of the American Secret Service agencies. Apparently they were not on the list in France. Moving to France we don’t even have a list of terrorists in France. There is no such thing as a full list of people suspected or convicted of terrorism. So, this has to be done. This has to be shared with other countries. Some five million copies of Charlie Hebdo have been sold globally in tribute to those who died. Best known among them the editor, who was buried today. He had lived unther a death threat for several years but refused to be cowed. In the latest tradition that spirit survived. I am less scared of religious extremists than I am of secularists who keep quiet. One of the people who came here today was a 24-year-old man from Mali, a Muslim who helped to hide the jewish hostages in the basement of the supermarket. More than 300,000 people in France demanded he be given French citizenship on a petition. Last night that was granted. When he arrived here at the Town Hall he was mobbed by children of all faiths who had come to see john Kerry. Fears are raised, with implications for us here in the UK. It is something they have been worried about here in the UK for some time. I think we can see European Governments as a whole jumpy at the moment. There are a lot of people who have gone to Syria and Iraq who have come back. Some will have been watched for some time, like those in Belgium, we understand. The fear is, in some cases, that they may accelerate their plans or decide to do something because of what has happened in Paris. They may want to piggyback on that event, to have more impact. So, you’ve got those cells that have come back. You have got lone actors, who have bin spired about want to do something, who -- who have been inspired, who want to do something and who need to be watched. Already they have been on a high state of alert. They will go back to some of these individuals and saying, have they changed their behaviour in the last week or so since Paris? Is there any sign they are accelerating plans? Is there an increased threat? Do we watch them or try and watch them and move against them. It is possible, as we have seen in Europe, we might see more arrests here or keep groups under surveillance. There is a greater edginess here in Britain and across Europe in the wake of Paris. Many thanks. 81% in December, while Northern Ireland did the worse at 77%. In England, around 90% of patients were seen within the recommended time last week - seen within the recommended time last week - a slight improvement on the previous seven days. Our correspondent reports from the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. A fortnight ago this man broke his leg playing rugby. just five minutes away from the local A&E. It was so busy no ambulance could be sent to him for three hours. As paramedics were stuck waiting to hand over patients. It was the cold more than anything. I was shaking. I was shivering and soaking wet. I had been playing and obviously laying there so long the cramp started to set in and that was worse. That was painful. The pressure is becoming intolerable for some staff too. According to the College of Emergency Medicine, workers used to t unpredictable demands of A&E are being reduced to tears. The relentless, sustained pressure and also the inability to give the level of care and service that people want to give that you are not giving carers as -- to give that you are not giving carers as -- giving care as well as I think you should, that is what wears people down. Despite efforts to free up space, even cancelling some operations, the strain is continuing to show. The number of emergency patients being treated within four hours has been slipping month by month. The target is 95%. Here in Wales, in November, the figure was 83.8%. In December, that fell again, tojust 81%. The worst performance in five years. It is also worse than the December figure for England - It is also worse than the December figure for England - just over 90%. Better than Northern Ireland, which has the worst record for waiting times in the whole of the UK. Falling below 77%. With the Labour Government responsible for health in Wales, the figures have a political currency. The UK Government has branded the Welsh NHS a second-class service. The challenge is not how we throw insults at each other across the border. The challenge is - insults at each other across the border. The challenge is - how do we equip our NHS to do the bestjob possible? How do we support our hard-working staff? How do we deal with an ageing population, still coming into A&E in large numbers? That is what is extraordinary about the situation here in Wales. With an election looming, the pressure for results is growing. Those on the front line warn it may get worse before it gets better. New guidelines suggest A&E departments in England should have one nurse on duty for every four cubicles. The advice comes from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, which says the NHS needs to be prepared for unpredictable peaks in the numbers of patients. The Royal College of Nursing says that means several thousand more staff would be needed. Our Health Correspondent Branwen jeffreys has the details. In A&E nurses are constantly on the go. Very sick patients have to be monitored carefully. New advice to the NHS in England sets out how many nurses are needed. Newham Hospital in east London already meets those standards - something nurse managers say is essential for good care. The more qualified clinical staff there are arouund, who understand what they are looking at in terms of blood pressure monitoring, pulse monitoring, who understand, just by looking at a patient whether they are getting better, whether there is any risk, who are present and on the floor to look at people all the time, then clearly the safer we are. This draft advice on A&E safe staffing levels will now be consulted on. It suggests one nurse to every four patients overall and two nurses for every one patient in cases of trauma after major accidents or cardiac arrest. This team already has the starting levels that are being recommended. It allows them to cope with the very unpredictable work of an Emergency Department, where each day they don’t know exactly what is going to come through their door. Labour says some hospitals in England are nowhere near this level and the nurses’ union, the RCN, warns some units are understaffed but hospitals have been investing in more nurses overall the Government argues its plans to ensure safe staffing are working. Let us start with the targets for A&E and the speed patients are being seen. It is not a good picture. The key thing it is emphasising the pressures are being felt round the UK. We get weekly figures in England, but only monthly for Wales and Northern Ireland, so this if you like creates the full picture, Wales recording the worst figures for A&E, waiting time, since their records began in 2009. That was for December. Interestingly for England, there was a slight improvement last week, on the previous week, and that was the week when leading hospitals some declared major incidents to try to clear the backlog. In England there are going to be attempts made be the NHS to cut down the number of wasted ambulance journeys The government on the advice of NHS England, clinicaladvice government on the advice of NHS England, clinical advice they say, are going to give call operators in two pilot areas the ability to spend longer making a decision they only have 60 seconds under the current rule to independence despatch an ambulance. Forthe rule to independence despatch an ambulance. For the second most urgent category sometimes they send them off on calls like that which turn out not to be so urgent. So time is wasted. They think they will get a better outcome for patients which giving operators longer, three minutes, to make the decision Labour are saying, hang on, you are changing the rules. It has been 60 seconds followed by eight minute, you are changing the rules in the middle of the worst winter. Could that mean a relaxing of standards. Thank you. You can find out how your nearest emergency department is coping by visiting the data tracker online. Pop many your postcode and it will show you whether your local A&E is meeting the waiting time target. Our top story. Belgium is on high alert, after two suspected Islamist militants are shot dead in a raid that officials believe prevented a major plot to attack police stations. And today in France the US Secretary of State, john Kerry, paid tribute to those murdered in last weeks shootings in Paris. Later on BBC London. The country’s largest single policing command is launched to reduce injuries on London’s roads. And beating the Melbourne heat. We speak to the Londoner and British number one about burning rubber to win the Australian Open. Britain and America are to carry out cyber attack ""war games"" on each other, as part of a newjoint defence initiative against hacking. David Cameron says it’s one of the ""biggest modern threats"" to national security, and on the second day of his trip to Washington, he and President Obama are expected to announce they’ll be stepping up their response. This report from Naomi Grimley contains the first ever footage filmed inside of GCHO’s Operations Centre in Cheltenham. Inside GCHO, these are rare glimpses of life at the government’s eavesdropping hub in Cheltenham. In the age of gun attacks on Paris and cyber attacks like the recent one on Sony Pictures, this place is very much at the front line. On his visit to Washington DC, David Cameron wants to make cyber security a number one priority for transatlantic cooperation. He wants the two countries to simulate how they would cope with cyber attacks on key institutions like the Bank of England. But he also wants the President to get tough on social media giants like Facebook and Twitter, now that they seem to be howjihadists communicate and inspire each other. The Prime Minister thinks these companies should be made to flag up dangerous material to the authorities, and there should also be limits to message encryption on their sites. We need to be able, in extremis, to interrupt the contacts between terrorists, whether they are using fixed phones, mobile phones or the internet. We both face the same challenge and we need to work with these big companies - we have good relationships with them - to make sure we keep people safe. The Prime Minister, though, may not have much luck on this. After all, America’s big tech companies jealously guard their privacy, especially after Edward Snowden revealed the extent of US government surveillance. But this visit also has an unspoken aim for David Cameron. His very presence in DC helps him to polish his credentials as a global statesman. Barack Obama may not have sky-high approval ratings here in the US, but in Europe, he is regarded as something of a political rock star. Perhaps, with a British general election just around the corner, David Cameron is hoping some of that stardust rubs off on him. Our correspondent is in Washington. One wonders what they think they can do this this regard. Technology moves and improves so quickly, keeping one step ahead of the hackers will prove difficult. I think what they are hoping is this added cooperation, the creation of the new cyber cells will give them a great deal more muscle, if you like, to tackle these threats to business, to Governments, and of course, the connections that are being made between terrorists over the internet ass well. So they are going to pool their expertise, they will try and simulate some of the threats by the war games later this year, attacks on banks in London, in the financial centre there, attacks on Wall Street here, to try and learn what they can, and also try and train a whole generation of new cyber specialists. I think the real controversial part of this, and the part where there is daylight between Barack Obama and David Cameron, is this whole question of how much you can lean on Facebook and Twitter and Google to share their encrypted daid data and give Governments access to that, because in this country, privacy is regarded as a very sacred thing, not quite the same in the UK. The mystery of what happened to the British built Beagle 2 spacecraft, which was thought to have crash landed on Mars, has been solved. An orbiting spacecraft shows it did land on the red planet and is in one piece. Our Science Correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, has the story. The end of a life-long dream. The moment that Professor Colin Pillinger accepted that his spacecraft was lost on the martian surface. on the Martian surface. Many thought that Beagle 2’s parachute had failed and the spacecraft had crash-landed, instead of unfolding its solar panels and sending back scientific data. But this new picture shows that the spacecraft is still in one piece, and the parachute and rear cover nearby. And this close-up shows two small circles next to a larger one, indicating that only two of its four solar panel has fully unfolded. solar panels had fully unfolded. The panels that didn’t deploy may have blocked radio transmissions from the spacecraft and prevented it from charging up. Well, my reaction is a mix of emotions. One elation that we know that Beagle 2 is on Mars and the entry and landing system work. and landing system worked. Frustration that maybe Beagle 2 maybe didn’t fully deploy and that answers the question of why we never heard from it on the surface of Mars, and also quite a bit of sadness in that Colin Pillinger passed away last year. We just got so close but we just couldn’t do the science. Critics have said that Beagle 2 should never have flown, The technology was too cheap and simply not up to it. But the latest images show it came very close to being successful. Everything, it seems, went exactly to plan, until the very last minute. Professor Pillinger’s family has said that today’s news is vindication of his work. Dad was always keen on using football analogies to explain how his mission was progressing, and I think he probably may have used something along of lines of saying - where previously we missed a goal, maybe now we hit the crossbar instead. I think he would be very satisfied to have news of what happened to Beagle, but I think he would have been certainly banging the drum to make sure that future missions went ahead. Today’s announcement is a bitter sweet moment for the Baegle 2 team. The spacecraft worked well but wasn’t able to search for life on Mars. The Duchess of Cambridge has been learning about the benefits of fostering, after she joined a charity reception to celebrate the work of foster carers. The Duchess, who is six months pregnant, spoke to carers and young adults who had been fostered. The Fostering Network says that more than 63,000 children live with foster families across the UK, and have often experienced neglect and abuse. Our royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell reports. She is now approximately 14 weeks to the expected birth of her second baby. Relaxed it would seem and continuing with a limited programme of engagements. The Duchess of Cambridge was focussing on a charity which helps children who haven’t had the good fortune to be born into a stable domestic environment. More than 60,000 children in the United Kingdom live with foster parents, who bring love and guidance to young lives which are frequently lack such support. Zoe has been with foster parent since the age of 8. I was lucky to have them, I know not everyone is as lucky, but without them, I couldn’t be where I am today. What you doing now? Am in my second year of university. Something when I first come into care I never dreamed of being able to do. With that support that is where I am now. Kate heard about the work of the charity, the fostering Net, Who and the need for more foster parents. It is estimated 9,000 more families are needed across the country. It was all a very different perspective on family life for a Royal Dutches, as she prepares for the expansion of her own. England versus Australia is a fixture set to dominate the cricketing calendar in 2015, and the two sides have been in action in Sydney today. In their first match of the year, Australia came out on top, Andy Swiss reports. The start of a World Cup and Ashes year. For England, a chance to set the tone - oh dear. Ian Bell out first ball, Australia cockahoop. If that was bad, moments later, it got even worse. England two wickets down after three balls. That cartoon duck seemed to say it all. Finally they worked out how to hit it but with less than glorious results. At 33-4 they were staring at humiliation. That they avoided it was entirely to this man, Eoin Morgan. England’s new one-day skipper with the definition of a captain’s innings, but despite his superlative century, England’s total of 224 never looked enough. It wasn’t. Chris Woakes’ early wicket gave them a glimmer of hope but it soon disappeared over the boundary ropes. David Warner marking his match-winning 100 with a look to the heavens for his late team-mate, Phillip Hughes, a poignant note, amid what, for England, was a largely disspiriting day. It looks nice town there. Down under. Not so here Louise? We would love some Australian sunshine now. We have seen some heavy rain in the far south-east, so far today. That is clearing away from the Kent coast. Further north under the cold air we have showers of rain, hail, sleet, snow and thunder, driven on by a brisk breeze. They will continue through the rest of this afternoon. Elsewhere, some winter sunshine across England and Wales and a few isolated showers, but it will feel cold out there, particularly the further north and west you are, further south not quite in the cold airjust yet, six to eight Celsius. The cold air continues to push further south. Through the night under clearer skies it turns cold and will continue to see widespread showers through the north and west. If if they fall and as rain on the temperatures falling away, there could be freezing surfaces out there. We have this fairly organised line of showers from that weak weather front on Saturday morning. So icy stretches could be an issue as those showers continue to drift east. They will clear away by coffee time on Saturday morning and then a slight contrast, a little quieter. Winter sunshine round, a few showers but a cold feel out there. Two or threes at the north, 47 further south. There is a level of uncertainty about Sunday’s forecast as this area of low pressure drifts off to Biscay. It will push up some warm, moist air with it. That will mix with the cold air we have got, undercutting this front, there could be the potential for heavy rain across southern England and maybe in ",,

The criminal who masterminded a gun-running operation - from his cell in Wandsworth Prison. And a new deal for homeowners living near the planned HS2 rail line Good evening. Belgium has said it is ready to call in the troops to increase security after foiling what it believes was an imminent attack by Islamist militants on its police force. Two of the suspected gunmen were killed during the raid last night. Tonight, five people have been charged with terrorism offences and there’ve been more many arrests across France, Germany and Belgium as police try to thwart further attacks. But the police agency, Europol, has warned that the sophisticated methods used by Islamic extremists are making it ‘extremely difficult’. Our Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt is in Brussels for us tonight, Gavin. Certainly today, there was increased understanding that the threat posed by radical Islamists is notjust to individual countries but a challenge to Europe as a whole. Today, over 30 people were arrested in raids in France, here in Belgium but also in Germany, in what one official described as a growing merge. ITIEFQE. "" âITIâI’gâI’ICy. -- emergency. Another European country on edge. This was the queue waiting to be checked at the Palace De justice in Brussels. Last night in this narrow corridor in the small town of Verviers, the police say that they smashed a terrorist cell. In the darkness, the police went in, they faced men with Kalashnikov, handguns and explosives. It is thought that they would have launched an attack within hours. In the daylight, once again another group of bewilderered citizens, struggling to find explanations. TRANSLATION: We have known for years that there have been radical groups in Verviers, we did not know where exactly but we knew. It is getting closer. It is scary. To me this is nothing to do with Islam. Islam is a peaceful religion, we are against this. This is a terrorist gone mad. Nothing to do with religion. Today, the details of a plot emerged, plotting against the police officers outside of their own stations. They were the apparent target, symbols of Belgium power. All I can confirm, that the plans were to assassinate policemen in the street or in the buildings. The two suspects to have died are said to have returned from Syria. Today more raids and five people charged with participating in a terrorist group. So Belgium, like France adapts. jewish schools closed, the army may be called up, police officers are told not to patrol alone. police officers are told not to patrolalone. Belgium is police officers are told not to patrol alone. Belgium is a small country of 11 million but with a large Muslim population. Nearly 350 Muslims have gone to fight in Syria. A higher numberthan Muslims have gone to fight in Syria. A higher number than elsewhere in Europe. Some say that young Muslim men resisted integrating, others say that they are alienated, left on the margins. The people are going there as they are young, some of them are disturbed. They have not found a place in society. Why not go there? In Verviers, the local imam blames ideology for the radicalisation for young people. TRANSLATION: I think now the internet is the main source of radicalisation. Unfortunately I don’t have a solution. I don’t think that the authorities have one either. So far, there appears no direct connection between what happened here and the attacks in France. The French Prime Minister says that the link that does exist is the will to attack our values. But the fact is that an estimated 5,000 young men and women from Europe could have made the journey to Syria. As Belgium joined France and Germany in a wide hunt for terrorist suspects, the head of one of Europe’s law enforcement bodies acknowledged it was not possible to catch all of the jihadists. It cannot be done, he says. David Cameron says the UK and America have agreed to establish a joint group to ""counter the rise of domestic violent extremism"". Speaking at the White House following talks with President Obama, the Prime Minister said the West is facing a ""poisonous and fanatical ideology"", that hoped to pervert Islam, creating ""conflict, terror and death"". This reports does contain some flash photography. Once again a British Prime Minister and the President of the United States, they are talking about sharing the same values in the face of a common threat. The President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom... After a second day of talk, David Cameron and brome agreed that officials would examine what drys radicalisation and how to manage the risk of fighters returning from Syria. This is a problem that causes great heartache and tragedy and destruction but it is one that ultimately we are going to defeat. We know what we are up against and how to win. News from back home, that the protection of the police is being reviewed after the Paris attacks and the foiling of two alleged plots to target officers last year. There is to be a visible police presence too around potentialjewish targets. Prime Minister, with the extra security put in place for the jewish community and police officers, are people right to conclude that the threat of an attack on the streets of Britain is now awe but imminent? It is good that the Metropolitan Police have announced that they are stepping up patrols. I melt with the leader of thejewish stepping up patrols. I melt with the leader of the jewish council this week. We were you Government money to help protectjewish schools. But we have to recognise in fighting terrorism, as we have found in Britain before, you cannot rely on policing and security. This is a job for everyone. The threat level, he said, is at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. The President suggested that America had a lesson to teach Europe - how to integrate Muslim communities. Our biggest advantage is that our Muslim populations they feel themselves to be Americans. There is the incredible process of immigration and assimilation that is part of our tradition. There are parts of Europe in which that is not the case. Terror may once again have dominated the talks but they were conceived, at least in part, for pictures like these, designed to show how close they are and words like these, from a President whojoked they are and words like these, from a President who joked that some were a little puzzled by the fact he called his visitor ""bro"" I have explored the origins of the word, others have debated the definition. Some wondered what he meant. Simply, David is a great friend. One of my closest and trusted partners in the world. Great Britain and the United States are two economies that are standing out at a time when a lot of other countries are having problems. So we musting doing something right. This could be David Cameron’s last ever visit to the White House as the Prime Minister but he will hope that Barack Obama’s lavish prays, the warm welcome he laid on over the two days makes that prospect a little less likely. But as he leaves Washington, the Prime Minister knows that most people are thinking not about an election but the threat of terrorism. Police in France have arrested 12 people in raids across the country as they hunt for those who may have played a role in last week’s attacks on Paris. Our Special Correspondent Fergal Keane has been to Toulouse in South West France Tackling Radicalisation to talk to those who are tackling radicalisation and trying to stop people falling prey to Islamist extremists. In cities across Europe, fundamentalist groups have lured the young into violence. This is Toulouse in South West France, a region that’s seen scores of young men recruited by extremists. Dominique’s son, Nicolas, was killed last year fighting in Syria, she heard of his death via text message. TRANSLATION: I did not know whether I should laugh or cry. If it was somebodyjoking. I threw away the phone. I just don’t know. I feel I am in a nightmare. Nicolas was raised as an atheist, but converted to Islam during a trouble time in his life. His parents had divorced. He was taking drugs. Radicalised by contact with extremists, Nicolas introduced his younger step-brother, Daniel, to the cause, both were killed in Syria. TRANSLATION: He said he was trying to find himself, and he found himself in this religion. It was not normal. He did not want to go out, to party. It was only about religion. Nicolas found certainty and what was for him an idealistic cause in the ranks ofjihadis, but the extremists draw troubled young from very different backgrounds. In Toulouse, a petty criminal from a broken home, Mohammed Merah, murderedjewish children and French soldiers. Growing up on the tough Les Izards estate extremism offered an outlet for his violent rage. Frederick was his football coach. Now, he’s on a one-man unpaid mission to save vulnerable youngsters from the clutches of extremists. TRANSLATION: The aim, because we live in a very difficult area, with a lot of social problems, is to instill values through football. To send young people on the right path. When you give them some balance in life they won’t get radicalised and do the horrible things, like what happened here in Toulouse and also in Paris. Every player kept out of trouble is a small, but important victory. Especially with young men who feel unwanted in French society. TRANSLATION: Given what happened here, the people of France have lumped all Muslims together. The area has been abandoned. No politicians come here. The Charlie Hebdo attack makes things worse. It means we’ll have to redouble our efforts to find work, or get on in life. In the wake of the Paris murders, there’s renewed focus on the mosques. The Imam of this Toulouse mosque has constantly argued against the extremists, but understands the power they can have over the young. TRANSLATION: If we don’t take care of them, they become vulnerable, attracted to what gives them a sense of belonging, a refuge from the problems they have, to tackle this the government, everybody, must work with us because it threatens us all. Ramped up security, investment in troubled estates, these will form a core part of the French government’s response to the tragedy in Paris, but the experience, here in Toulouse, shows what might be gained from reaching out and supporting those who are taking an often lonely stand against the preachers of hate. Fergal Keane, BBC News, Toulouse. Here, police are stepping up patrols in jewish neighbourhoods across Britain and looking at meaures to protect their own officers in the wake of the Paris attacks. Our Home Affairs Correspondent, Daniel Sandford, is at New Scotland Yard. What kind of police presence can we expect? We are talking about the overall assess threat to the UK. That has been severe since August as MI5 assessed that an attempted attack is highly likely. What we less often talk about is the individual threats within that overall threat. We have seen two specific examples of that today, the police have told thejewish community they are increasing patrols in thejewish neighbourhoods and in places wherejewish people congregate. And a lot of other work going on behind the scene, intelligence work for example. After the attack on a cosher supermarket in Paris last week and from the chatter picked up across the globe from extremists, it is believed that there is an enhanced threat against the jewish there is an enhanced threat against thejewish community. The Prime Minister met thejewish leaders to discuss that risk. While that has been going on, the threat assessment against police officers themselves today went up to severe. Police officers were killed in Paris last week, we have also seen a potential threat against police officers in Belgium. So police constables, are deploying police officers on to the streets, are at the moment worry being the threat against the officers themselves. The number of people waiting more than four hours in Accident and Emergency departments in Wales and Northern Ireland rose last month. In England, hospitals improved but still missed their target again of seeing 95% of patients within four hours. The figure in Wales was 81% in December- the worst waiting times in five years. Northern Ireland fared even worse withjust under 77%. In England around 90% of patients were seen within the recommended time - an improvement, but still below target. In a moment I’ll be talking to our Health Correspondent, Branwenjefferys, but first Hywell Griffith reports from Wales. The start of the weekend and another test for the Welsh NHS. When A&E becomes full, it’s often paramedics left holding the fort. Waiting in the car park with patients who can’t be admitted. Luigi knows all about the pain of waiting. As soon as the blood starts flowing, that’s when I start feeling the sensation. He broke his leg playing rugby, but his local A&E was so busy it took three hours to send an ambulance for him. It was the cold more than anything. I was shaking, I was shivering. Then obviously laying there for so long, cramp started to set in. That was even worse then. That was excruciating. You don’t have to look far to see the strain on staff either. One A&E consultant told us morale is plummeting. They feel they’re under siege. They cannot do the job they’re coming in to do. It depresses them, demoralises them, a lot of people are upset and leaving. They don’t feel like coming to work. It’s a very unpleasant atmosphere to work. Performance on A&E waiting times in Wales has dropped to a five-year low. Consistently lagging behind England and Scotland. So why’s the performance here in Wales so much worse? Some believe it’s down to an older population, others blame a legacy of industrial diseases, but there are also difficult political questions. Wales is the only part of the UK to cut its health budget over the last four years. That was the Welsh Labour Government’s decision, one their opponents won’t let them forget. When you pull the plug on funding, in the way that has been the case here in Wales in recent years, it makes the challenge all that more difficult. The challenge is not how we throw insults at each other across the board. The challenge is, how do we equip our NHS to do the bestjob possible? Some argue politicians only offer sticking plaster solutions, the problem is bigger than them. Money alone is not the answer. It is about looking at that entire system. The trouble is, the health service gets involved in fire fighting, in dealing with the crises and doesn’t probably spend enough time actually redesigning the whole system to stop the fires breaking out in the first place. How the NHS copes is under greater scrutiny than ever. In an election year, its fast becoming the political front-line. Hywell Griffith, BBC News, Cardiff. Our Health Correspondent Branwen jeffreys is here. A&E still struggling- what is being done to ease the pressure? In England things have eased up slightly. There are ideas about how to take the pressure off. New staffing guidelines on how many patients a nurse can safely look after in A&E. Broadly welcomed. Controversial changes to ambulance services. If a 999 call comes in that’s categorized as being critical or life-threatening, an ambulance still has to be sent within a minute, got on the road. It has to reach the patient within eight minutes. Senior doctors say those targets mean that too many ambulances are setting out. It’s often turns out to not be a life-threatening situation. In two areas, London and the south-west, ambulance call handlers will be given three minutes, instead of one, to make that decision. Labour says now is not the time to experiment when the NHS is under so much pressure, but these will be carefully monitored pilots. Of course, they will be under a lot of scrutiny. Branwen, thank you. You can find out plenty more about the NHS this winter on the BBC News website. You can also track how hospitals in your local area are performing. More than 10,000 children are thought to have been orphaned by Ebola in West Africa, most of them in Sierra Leone. Many of these children fell ill themselves, but survived. Now, they’re being shunned by communities terrified of catching the virus. Tulip Mazumder travelled to an orphanage in Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, to find out what the future holds for some of these children. Behind these playful smiles is great pain and great loss. All these children have a tragic tale to tell, most are Ebola orphans. Hadja lost almost all of her family to the virus. Ten of them died. Only I survived. When I was sick, I was helpless, and I don’t even expect that I will survive. 12-year-old Mohammed has arrived in the last few days. I am not feeling good, because I don’t have mother and father. He tells me how he and his sister were cast out by their own family. They roamed the streets for two days. Eventually, they were brought here. I am feeling good when I am here. They will take care of me well. I eat good food. I sleep happily, and good play, and I will study. Looking at these children, you’d have no idea what they’ve been through. Most have lost both parents, some have lost all of their extended family. Others have been outcast from their communities. They simply have nowhere else to go. A child like four years, five years, nine years, seeing ambulances come into their homes, collecting the corpses of his or her mother, is too much for that child. An important part of the team’sjob is to help reunite orphaned children with their extended families. Today, Agustin is checking up on 12-year-old Parfudi. But whilst in the village, we hear about more children who need help. These are three orphans. They have lost both parents to Ebola, and they are now being cared for by their uncle. Their uncle says he can’t afford to look after them and asks Augustin to take them away. So he starts the process of having them brought to the orphanage. Back at St George’s, which is partly funded by the UK, there is still optimism, despite all the suffering. Even though they might have lost their parents, they might have lost other relatives, but the world is watching. Tulip Mazumder, BBC News, Freetown. A lI7-year-old man has been charged with arson in connection with a spate of fires in south Oxfordshire yesterday. The fires all started within 10 minutes of each other. Andrew Main was remanded in custody and will appear in court tomorrow. The wife of a Saudi Arabian blogger, who was publicly flogged for insulting Islam, says he has been given fresh hope that the authorities may be re-considering his punishment. Raif Badawi was sentenced to 10 years injail and a total of 1,000 lashes to be carried out at weekly intervals. Today’s planned flogging was postponed for medical reasons. Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, is here. So a glimmer of hope that he may be spared? That is right. His wife told the BBC that his case has been taken by the Office of the King of of Saudi Arabia. The authorities are trying to see if they can end the punishment that has caused an international outcry. Last Friday he was taken to a public square outside a mosque and flogged 50 times. That was supposed to happen today. He was examined by a doctor, he decided his wounds hadn’t healed from last week. That was postponed. He is said to face another 18 weeks of this. Am nest any international said the fact that they were looking at his wounds to see if they had heal was outrageous. Perhaps not a coincidence with the international outcry that the lashes didn’t happen today. The case is possibly being reviewed. Lucy, thank you. Beagle2, it was a British spacecraft that cost £50 million and its mission, more than a decade ago, was to land on Mars. It disappeared in December 2003 as it neared the Red Planet and hadn’t been heard from since. Until today, when scientists announced that they have found it on the surface of Mars, where it is supposed to be, and just a couple of miles from its intended landing site. Our science editor, David Shukman, reports. Somewhere in the alien landscape of Mars, a tiny British spacecraft lay missing for more than a decade. Beagle2 was sent to search for evidence of life. The first signal was meant to be a tune by the band Blur. But there was no sign of it, and the assumption was that the spacecraft had crashed on Christmas Day 2003. We do not have a signal from Beagle2. The man behind the mission was the colourful figure of Colin Pillinger. He died last year, so we’ll never know of today’s news, that Beagle2 did actually make it - a poignant moment for his family. It’s great that it landed. He would have been so pleased. We can only try and show you how pleased we are for him. It’s a great moment for you? Definitely a great moment. The discovery came in new pictures. A small but distinct shape, too bright to be a boulder and right in the landing zone. Scientists believe the spacecraft had started working. This is a life-sized copy of Beagle2, and it helps explain what happened. Clearly, the spacecraft touched down in good enough condition to start deploying its solar panels. The scientists reckon that at least two of them opened, possibly a third as well. ",,

A service to honour the three police officers killed in last week’s terror attack has been taking place in Paris. President Hollande posthumously awarded the two them and woman the Legion d’honneur, the country’s highest honour. He said they died so that fans could live in freedom. Two of the officers were shot at the magazine Charlie Hebdo. The first edition since the attacks is published tomorrow, a cartoon depicting the Prophet Mohammed is on the cover.

The surviving staff of the magazine Charlie Hebdo have been working on this week’s special edition in space lent to them by the newspaper Liberation. They said they are determined to carry on but then most difficult decision must have been what to put on the front cover. Last night, the magazine released the front cover cartoon they have chosen. It shows the Prophet Mohammed holding a ""je suis Charlie"" sign with the words, all is forgiven. Wejust sign with the words, all is forgiven. We just continue to make the newspaper every week. Of course it will never be the same again, we just still don’t know how we will continue without them, because we lost eight people, eight import people for us, eight friends. Newspaper stands have put in record orders this weekend, expecting demand from new readers. But some have cautioned the magazine to exercise constraint. Either they be consistent and demonise and mocked every minority and community, or they show Whiston, especially in this climate. just because you can do something, does not mean you have to -- do something, does not mean you have to -- they show wisdom. Amid the public mourning, French police say as many as six members of the extremist cell which carried out the Paris attacks may still be at large. The country has deployed 10,000 troops to protect sensitive sites including jewish schools and synagogues, mosques, and major transport hubs. Thousands of people have gathered at a cemetery in Giroud Slim for the funerals of the four people killed at a jewish supermarket-- a cemetery injerusalem. Many in Netanyahu said their lives had been cut down by hatred. -- Netanyahu said their lives had been cut down by hatred. -- Benjamin Netanyahu. Screened by the trees behind me, the relatives of the dead men are standing by their fresh graves, reflecting after a very solemn ceremony earlier. The bodies were all flown into Israel from France just this morning. Murdered in Paris but made to rest injerusalem. None of the four jewish men killed in a French kosher supermarket on Friday was an Israeli citizen, yet the Israeli Government offered to arrange their funerals here. The families all accepted. Yohan Cohen, 22, was a worker at the Hypercacher store. Yoav Hattab, 21, was a student. Philippe Ramm, in his mid-lios, was a sales manager and father of four. Francois-Michel Saada, a retired father of two, was in his 60s. Israel’s top Rabbis led the commemorations. Then, there were tears filled tributes from those who had lost their loved ones. Israel’s political elite all turned out to PHY political elite all turned out to pay their respects. And now these ambulances are being used to transport the bodies to their final resting places, along the road here in the cemetery. The decision to bury all four of the men here is being signed as -- bury all four of the men here is being signed as -- seen as a sign of the insecurity that many feel in the Frenchjewish community the insecurity that many feel in the French jewish community and their fears about anti-Semitism. Despite assurances from French officials that jews assurances from French officials thatjews remain an integral part of France, many say they want to emigrate. Last year, nearly 7000 moved to Israel and the Israeli authorities are encouraging more to come. They expect more than 10,000 this year. It is normal Israeli Government policy to encourage jews from around the world to make this their home, but the invitation made by the Israeli Prime Minister after that huge unity rally that took place in Paris on Sunday has been criticised, with many European leaders saying that running away is simply not the answer. Here, the UK terroralert Here, the UK terror alert level is at severe, the second-highest, meaning an attack is thought likely. That politicians are divided on how best to monitor the online activities of suspected terrorists. The Paris attacks sparked an international debate about free speech. For politicians and security chiefs dealing with the threat from radical Islam, the challenge is to balance Civil Liberties with national security. In the UK once again, the focus is on technology in the fight against extremism. The Prime Minister is keen for the intelligence agencies to have new powers which would allow them to access records of individuals online and their mobile phone activity. It has been dubbed a snooper’s charter and that is how David Cameron’s Deputy referred to it this morning in a radio interview, underlining his opposition to the move and a split in the coalition. What the snoopefs split in the coalition. What the snooper’s charter was about is storing the social media activity and websites visited by every single man, woman and child in the country, by everyone. If the information is to be stored, how do the authorities get access to it’s there should be strict rules, according to one conservative. The question is, who will give the authorisation? At the moment, that is the important debate. I would like to see that done at a senior level but you cannot have the Home Secretary issuing a warrant every time. This afternoon in the House of Lords, peers will debate other counterterrorism measures which are already forming part of proposed legislation. Amongst the most controversial is a plan to exclude British citizen is considered a security threat from returning temporarily to the UK. Inflation has fallen matching its lowest level on record back in 2000. The rate for December fell to 0.5%, pushed down by the global cost of food and fuel. It might be good news for shoppers, but as our economic correspondent explains, some people are worried about the long-term effect of low inflation on the UK ‘s economy. In Spitalfields market in east London, you can see with your own eyes what inflation is at a record low. Take potatoes, where a ample harvest has left producers with far more potatoes to sell but no more buyers than before. To get rid of them, sellers have to slash their prices. It has been an ideal year for growing potatoes, every potato plant it has produced an amazing yield. Consequently there is an oversupply to the market and, with that, prices have produced dramatically. In a market like this, you can see supply and demand in action. Supply is the amount of goods they have, if there are lots of tomatoes the buyer to come here know that they can bargain down the price. Demand isjust the number of buyers. It means buyers can cut the price we pay for potatoes by 7.1%. The same thing happened to food generally, with prices down 1.9%. And even more plentiful supply of petrol brought prices down by nearly 23%. It is fantastic, it will save at least 200 or £300 a month with the distance I travel. I normally put in £10 a week to get around but I have put £20. It has cut my fuel bill in half compared to what it was before the price went down like this. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee is supposed to keep inflation between 1% and 3%. For the first time, the governor will have to write to the Chancellor, explaining why it has got to know. And it could get lower. I and large, the figures are good news in the short term for British households. It is largely caused by another petrol prices and food prices. It means your pound will stretch farther. The issue is to make sure this does not become more generalised, that we don’t think falling prices more generally, because a little bit of inflation is good for the economy. Prices of goods and services are still up, just about, by 0.5%, but if you look at good alone prices fell by 1%. If plentiful supply of food and petrol continues, they may get even cheaper. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor, Norman Smith. One Government minister said it was like a giant tax cut for the economy. If it? It reminds me of those football managers of a certain vintage with a fondness for sheepskin coats who would say, it is a game of two halves. These figures are, in a way, a gain of two halves. Good news for the coalition, but economically much more questionable. If prices are coming down then we have more money in our pockets and feel better off, and it is key household bills which are coming down, things like petrol prices, food prices, pressure on the energy companies now to bring down their prices. Low inflation equals low interest rate and low mortgages, all good news politically for the coalition trying to cut down Labour’s charge about a cost of living crisis. But economically inflation this low can suggest the economy is beginning to slow down and there are warnings that we might be in danger of going into deflation, exactly the trough that the euro zone is in. So it is a paradox. Ministers are celebrating the figures as good news, but at the same time the poor old governor of the Bank of England is having to get out his pen, write a letter to the Chancellor, apologising for low inflation and the potential danger to the economy. Thank you. The price of gas on the wholesale market is 30% lower than it was a year ago and today E.ON became the first of the big six energy firms to cut its prices by 3.5%, the equivalent of £24 of the average annual household gas bill. He is our business correspondent. -- here is our business correspondent. A big year by schoolchildren on saving energy. It was part of a competition run by E.ON. The German owned Big six supplier is now teaching its rivals a lesson, becoming the first to cut energy prices. We have been tracking, as we always do, the cost of energy, which make up about half of the overall bill that our customers get, and we started to see before Christmas that gas prices were reducing, and what we have done is passed that on as soon as we can to our customers and that equates to, in effect, a saving of about two weeks of gas for the majority of customers, so great news. E.ON is cutting its standard gas tariffs by an average of 3.5% and says it will not around £24 off an average bill, and roughly 2 million of its customers will benefit from the move. With energy bills such a huge drain on household budgets, this price move by E.ON will be welcomed, but there will be questions, too. Wholesale gas prices have fallen by around 30% over the past year. Somewhat argue it makes E.ON’s boot look rather modest. Energy is soaring up the political agenda. Labourannounced plans Energy is soaring up the political agenda. Labour announced plans to freeze prices. Today, E.ON said it is taking a risk as it could limit the ability to recover costs. Today, consumer groups piled on the pressure. It is not the right time, we should have seen this some time ago. Wholesale price has been coming down for a year, we wanted the companies to reduce their prices a lot earlier. One has gone so far, the rest need to follow suit. As for the other suppliers, they say they always keep prices under review, but with the sector in the middle of a major competition probe, further cuts now look inevitable. Our top story this lunchtime: A ceremony’s taken place to honour the three police officers shot dead in last week’s terror attacks in Paris. And in Israel, the four people killed in the jewish supermarket have been buried on the Mount of Olives. Later on BBC London: We speak to the Hertfordshire woman who’s one of only three people to be nominated for the first ever Oueen’s Young Leaders Award. And more weather warnings on the way. We’ll have a full update for you. Pope Francis has arrived in Sri Lanka at the start of a three-day visit. For a quarter of a century, the country was torn apart by a civil war that killed as many as 100,000 people. The Pope began his visit by calling for reconciliation between all sections of the country - Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian. Our religious affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, is travelling with the Pope and sent this report from the capital, Colombo. After a long flight from Rome, Pope Francis arrived to sunshine and a warm greeting on the tarmac from Sri Lanka’s new president, who has promised an end to the growing repression of religious minorities here. Your Holiness, my government is promoting peace and friendship among our people after overcoming a cruel conflict. We are people who believe in religious tolerance and coexistence, based on our religious heritage. This is a nation that wants its future to be a harmonious one, after a conflict that ended just five years ago after a lethal quarter of a century. But for this audience, the Pope chose to speak in English about the need to pursue the truth about what happened during that war. The process of healing must include the pursuit of truth, not for the sake of opening old wounds, but rather as a necessary means of promoting justice, healing and unity. As the Pope arrived, he said it was no easy task to overcome the bitter legacy of injustices, hostility and mistrust left by the conflict here. He said that it could be done, though, by cultivating reconciliation, solidarity and peace. The Pope’s route was lined with enthusiastic crowds. Many have travelled miles to see him, calling it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I think it is a miracle. It is very happy. I got tears in my eyes. I can’t imagine it. No words to say about that. We hope that from the Pope’s visit, we can have our problems solved this year. Although Catholics make up less than 10% of the population, they include both the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils. Today, with the visit of this Pope, there is hope that after years of despair, all can live in peace. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News, Colombo. Morrisons has become the latest supermarket chain to announce that its sales fell over the Christmas period. They were down by 3.1%, the worst figures out of all the UK’s big supermarkets. The company has announced that its chief executive is stepping down, as Simon Gompertz now reports. After five years as boss, Dalton Philips is taking the rap for what even the founder, Sir Ken Morrison, has called a disastrous time, during which he has already had to fend off calls to resign. Are you the right man to lead it? Absolutely, because we need to focus on these new channels. Playing catch up with the competition on new channels, Dalton Philips started opening Morrison’s convenience stores. He finally began selling on the internet around a year ago, selling on the internet around a yearago, promised £1 billion selling on the internet around a year ago, promised £1 billion worth of price cuts and launched the match and more card, giving customers savings. But none were instant remedies, and not enough to save his skin. I thought they would be one of the ones who were doing the bestjob out of the main supermarkets, to be fair. He was obviously trying to do well. Sorry to hear about it. I have got no complaints about him, I’m quite happy. # is beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Christmas is when the supermarkets have to show their mettle. For the second year running, Santa passed Morrison’s by. It is the clear loser. That is not to say that Tesco and Sainsbury’s aren’t still negative, because they are. But the correction that they have experienced over Christmas has been greater. In the six weeks to the beginning of january, Morrison’s’ sales were down a whopping 3.1% compared to a year before, although on purely food and drink, it did do better. When the tills rang out for Christmas, it was not nearly as much as they wanted here at Morrisons. All big supermarkets face a fight against the discounters, shop Mark -- supermarkets face a fight against the discounters, shop Mark -- Lidl and Aldi, Morrison’s has suffered and now the boss is paying the price. Now Morrisons is closing ten smaller loss-making stores, but it needs something more, and it is looking for a new executive to bring a fresh pair of eyes. Divers have retrieved the cockpit voice recorder from the AirAsia plane which crashed into the seas off Indonesia in December. It was located under debris near where the flight data recorder was found yesterday, and has been taken to the Indonesian capital, jakarta, for analysis. Officials say both black boxes are in good condition. A private consortium has been stripped of a £9 billion contract to clean up the nuclear waste site at Sellafield in Cumbria. Sellafield has been run by Nuclear Management Partners for more than six years, but the firm has been criticised for going millions of pounds over budget, and for delays which posed an ""intolerable risk."" The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority will now be responsible for the operation. A woman has died and 83 people have been hospitalised in Washington DC after a metro tunnel filled with smoke. Hundreds of people were forced to evacuate the Washington metro system during the rush hour yesterday afternoon. The incident was caused by an electrical malfunction, bringing much of the US capital’s transit network to a halt. It’s being predicted that in less than 10 years’ time, schools in England will need almost a million extra places for pupils. The Local Government association wants ministers to give councils more funding and powers to open new schools. Here’s our education correspondent, Alex Forsyth. A harmonious start to the school day. 15 years ago, this north-west London primary was half the size, and it’s still growing. In a few years, there will be more than 600 pupils on a site meant for 250. This will be six new classrooms and a new office block. To accommodate this growth, they are building on part of the playground. We have to manage playtimes with PE. Only having one school hall for 660 pupils will be an issue. We will continue to be an outstanding school, doing the best for our children and their families. But we have to think differently. Schools have been expanding and adding extensions like this for years to cope with the growth in pupil numbers, which is in part down to a spike in the birth rate. And despite the constant pressure and scramble for places, they have so far coped. Last year, 90,000 new school places were created, according to the Local Government Association. But it predicts than an extra 900,000 may be needed over the next decade, and that could cost £12 billion. We are simply reaching the point where we can’t physically fit any more children into many of our existing schools. That is why we are reaching the tipping point where to provide the school places we need over the next ten years, we need a wave of new primary schools up and down the country. And to deliver that capacity, we need a national programme. Labour says thousands of schools are already over capacity, but the Conservatives say the previous government failed to properly plan for the baby boom, and they are talking to schools and councils. Along with the Lib Dems, they point to £5 billion this Government spent on extra school places, with more money promised to deal with the growing demand. Alex Forsyth, BBC News. The UK is famous for its beautiful coastline and sealife. But only a tiny fraction is protected from things like overfishing or oil and gas extraction. Now the Marine Conservation Society is urging the public to get involved in a campaign to create 37 new protected areas around the UK, as Danny Savage now reports. They can easily go unnoticed, but more and more of our surrounding waters are becoming marine conservation zones. 2015 will see new areas potentially being given this conservation status. Including this, the Holderness coast in East Yorkshire. But why bother with this murky marine environment? What is so important is what lives underneath. And it is a whole ecosystem, and that word crops up so often. It’s everything that lives there, like on the land, the landscape with the hedgerows and the grasses and ponds, all that mix is going on underneath. And there is plenty of colourful life like this out there on the seabed. But it is at risk, and needs protecting, say conservationists. Lundy, off the coast of North Devon, was Britain’s first conservation zone. The sea life here looks like it is somewhere far more exotic, and it is now a showcase for what a well-protected marine environment can become. On the coast of North Yorkshire, Runswick Bay is another site where moves are under way to protect the offshore seabed. It is important for the preservation of seven different habitats that exist in this area. The Marine Conservation Society has assessed all the new proposed zones. It doesn’t mean fishing will be banned in all the areas, but methods will have to change. We’ve degraded our seas, without doubt, in the last 100 years of industrialfishing, and industrial use in the last 50 years, of our ports and harbours, the productivity of the sea has been suppressed. If it were to be allowed to come back in these small zones, we think we would be a great benefit to society. Although these new zones will be around England, similar schemes already operate off Scotland and Wales. In many areas of the UK, we have scallop beds, and what happens is that the best way to get them out is to extract them using dredgers. These have six-inch teeth, which are not very good for the seabed, so in marine conservation zones, we look to stop this activity, and only allow sustainable fisheries such as hand-collecting of such animals. And making things more sustainable is what this is all about, smoothing the way for keeping marine life in top condition. Time for a look at the weather. Looks like some snowy weather? Yes. This was East Dunbartonshire this morning. But many of us could be waking up to a dusting of snow, maybe a bit more tomorrow. We have seen a rash of showers for the West today. It brought some snow in this mass of showery rain across Wales for a time, but frequent snow showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland as we speak. Some hail mixed in there as well, even some thunder. Mostly showers of rain across England and Wales, maybe a bit of wet snow. But the cold air has not arrived yet. It is going to feel warm further north and on the strength of the winds, a disappointing afternoon. This evening, as temperatures fall away, that can only mean yet more snow across lower levels. The same for the north of England. And as darkness falls and temperatures dip, we could see further showers across Wales and the south-west. Maybe even a dusting of snow at lower levels as those showers continue to drift west and east overnight. It will be a breezy, showery and cold night. If we have snow showers, we could also see icy stretches. Wrap up warm tomorrow. Weather warnings have been issued for the central belt of Scotland. Be prepared for disruption with the snow here. Yellow warning elsewhere, whichjust with the snow here. Yellow warning elsewhere, which just means be aware that they could be some disruption with a bit of line snow and ice first thing. It is a wintry start to the day. The snow showers ease away slowly, but surely to the far north. Cloud and rain gathers towards the West, a sign of yet again, another change in ourforecast. Cold West, a sign of yet again, another change in our forecast. Cold to the East, milderfurther change in our forecast. Cold to the East, milder further west. change in our forecast. Cold to the East, milderfurther west. It is the mild air that starts to nudge the cold out of the way. Yet again, an area of low pressure starts to push in from the Atlantic. On the leading edge, we could see snow for a time across Scotland. It is not expected to last. Rain and wind will be the main story. That heavy rain will quickly push away, and then we move through to Thursday. It will be wet and windy day into the far north. Sunny spells and scattered showers as well, but look at the temperatures. Again, we have double figures in the south-east. Plenty is going on. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: Francois Hollande has led France’s tributes to the three police officers killed in last week’s terror attacks in Paris.

The funerals have taken place in Paris and jerusalem of seven of the people killed in last week’s attacks in the French capital. All have been given the country’s highest honour, the Legion d’honneur. In a solemn ceremony in Paris for the three police officers who lost their lives, President Hollande said they had died so that France could live in freedom. Two of the officers were shot at the office of the magazine Charlie Hebdo. The front cover of its first edition since the attacks depicts a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad, an image which is included in this report from our Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson. They say freedom has a price. This was the price it forced on France. Three police officers killed along with 14 other people in Islamist attacks last week. And for the highest price they received France’s highest honour, the Legion d’honneur, pinned to their coffins by the head of state. Their sacrifice was enough to move not just their relatives, but their Prime Minister and just their relatives, but their Prime Ministerand their Prime Minister and their president as well. His gentleness was a stark contrast to the way they died. TRANSLATION: I express my gratitude and also my pride because of view, with you, France is still standing. Long live the Republic, long-lived France. Another reminder it emerged today please courage during the attacks. This footage of the first two gunman revelling in what they had done. The freedoms they died for our being called on again this week by Charlie Hebdo’s surviving staff. Working out of temporary offices they have put together the next edition of the magazine. The print run is 50 times its normal circulation. The cartoon chosen for the front cover shows the Prophet Muhammad holding a sign and the words all is forgiven. At a press conference before tomorrow’s publication the artist responsible for the Drawing said there was no but when it comes to freedom of speech. One of his colleagues told me the team had drawn on their own grief for inspiration. If we can laugh at everything, even our own trauma, why should Islam be excluded? We are not obsessed by the Prophet Muhammad. We do not draw him more than the Pope on Nicolas Sarkozy. But why do people ask us as a Frenchjournalist Sarkozy. But why do people ask us as a French journalist team to respect something that is inside Islam, that belongs to Islam? I am Charlie has become a nationwide slogan, but many of the magazine’s defenders see it as provocative and crass. It is not the views of Charlie Hebdo they are defending, but the principle of free speech itself. TRANSLATION: They did this before, they caused problems, there are some values in life you do not touch. Islam today avoids using any image of the Prophet Muhammad and the biting satire of Charlie Hebdo has deepened the wound. But several Muslim leaders have supported the magazine’s right to publish. TRANSLATION: In France we have the chance to be free, to say what we like, even at the risk of offending our profit.

Funerals for the four people killed in Paris at a kosher supermarket have taken place injerusalem. Senior politicians joined the hundreds of people who attended. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu told the mourners the victims had returned to their true home but their lives had been cut down by hatred. Our Middle East Editorjeremy Bowen was there.

One of the four, johanne Coen, worked in the kosher supermarket that was attacked. The others were shopping on the eve of the jewish sabbath. Protect me, Philippe, said his widow Valerie. After the condolences of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the mourners that radical Islam was the enemy not just of Israel, but of the whole world. The European jews who founded modern Israel believed they had to rely on themselves for protection. Bad times forjews abroad often means more immigrants for Israel. In this country that is seen as a transfusion of strength. This couple travelled from Paris to mourn their friend. On Sunday there was a huge demonstration, something magnificent. The fact is it looked like a party. Somebody told me last night that the onlyjews that survived World War II was a pessimistic. Sol survived World War II was a pessimistic. So I think it is may be safer to be pessimistic and over optimistic, but anyway we do not have any vision to be over optimistic. The killings in Paris have sharpened all fears that are very deep inside manyjews and that is because of a long history of persecution, especially in Europe. All that feeds into one of the founding beliefs in Israel, which is the country has to stay strong and it cannot afford to let down its guard. The four men were buried next to each other. Israel’s Prime Minister has been criticised by some for exploiting their deaths, to look strong ahead of elections in March. But in Israel whenjews are killed, just because they are jews, here or abroad their deaths often create political consequences as well as personal charge of these. -- tragedies. We can talk to Christian Fraser in Paris. Coming back to Charlie Hebdo and the attacks on the magazine started all this, the new front cover is now being seen all around the world and it has provoked mixed responses in France it is fair to say. Yes, it has. Here tonight you can see people are still almost a week on from the attacks laying their Campbells and their pens and many people have already reserved their magazine copy tomorrow, such will be the demand in France. But there are people who are frustrated and they are worried about what the reaction might be at a time when security is at its highest level and they are worried it might provoke another reaction, notjust in France, but around the world. When they published pictures of the Prophet Muhammad in 2012, France had to step up security in 20 countries outside embassies and schools. The investigation is focusing on the enormous stash of weapons recovered from the gunman. We have heard from a police source that they came from outside the country. Who smuggled them and who paid for them? Alongside the security measures they are talking about, Parliament has voted to extend air strikes in Iraq. On the back of what has happened here over the last few days, they are strengthening their presence overseas and they have told people why they are doing that. Inflation is at its lowest level for fourteen years. It fell sharply in December to 0.5% thanks to the falling price of oil and the lower cost of food. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, says it is good news for most of us in the short term and may fall further. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston has more. The price of the fuel that powers the nation has fallen more than 10% over the past year and is the big reason why installation has dropped to itsjoint lowest reason why installation has dropped to its joint lowest level since records began in 1989. The reduction in the prices has opened up people’s opportunities and perhaps it has helped reinforce the confidence that the economy was already demonstrating. Infact, inflation is so low, more than 1% below the official target, that the governor of the bank of England is obliged to write a letter explaining what has happened to the Chancellor. Would you expect inflation to fall even further given what has been happening to oil prices? Given what is in the pipeline with oil prices and you can expect the petrol price to fall further, and the CPI will drift down in the coming months. No tears about falling prices on Teeside. It is expensive to run a car at the best of times, so any savings are appreciated. It is about a £5 difference, but every penny in mY a £5 difference, but every penny in my pocket is better than in someone else’s. People will use their cars. It has been a long time coming. It was not that long ago that inflation was massively above target. But today, along with oil, food prices have been dropping, as have shoes and clothing. Crude prices drop for other goods and services? Could we have deviation that will encourage us to delay our spending, that would trip the economy into a slump. How much risk is there that this low inflation becomes pernicious deflation? There is not much of a risk, but does it tell us the world economy is slowing much more than we thought six months ago? It is not the case, but this is to do with features in the oil market. With the food it is to do with whether and harvests. But I would be looking very hard at the global economy and I would be looking whether there would lead to even lower wage rises. What we might see here is interest rates at lower levels for longer? A year ago, to my expectations at that time, yes. They were lower than I would have expected. It is important people understand the direction and it will be an environment most likely that interest rates start to increase and move up over the next couple of years. Interest rate rises may be further down the road, perhaps beyond this year than we thought. The price of gas on the wholesale market is 30% lower than it was a year ago. And today E.ON became the first of the big six energy firms to cut its gas prices by 3.5%, that’s the equivalent to £24 off the average annual household gas bill. Here’s our Business Correspondent, john Moylan. Energy bills are a major drain on household budgets and they are a highly charged political issue as well. Party leaders have gone head to head to woo voters with their plans. Now E.ON is attempting to win over consumers, becoming the first of the big suppliers to cut prices. We have been tracking the costs of energy which make up half of the overall bill our customers get and before Christmas that gas prices were reducing and we have passed that on as soon as we can to our customers and that equates to in effect the savings of about two weeks use of gas for our customers. But how generous is this price move? By some measures wholesale gas prices are now 30% lower than at this time last year. Gas accounts for around half of the bill. That implies room for a price cut of around 15%. But E.ON says other parts of the bill, including the price of bringing energy to our homes and the Government green levies have been rising. But it makes the 3.5 reduction look rather modest. And for customers calling Citizens Advice help lies today, it also meant a little let off in the ongoing burden of high energy bills. We welcome any reduction, but gas and electricity prices are up a third since 2010, yet wholesale prices are at their lowest level for years and we need to see that being passed through to the consumers. Tomorrow MPs will debate whether firms should be forced to pass on falling wholesale costs. With the industry continuing to feel the political heat, cuts by the other six big suppliers now look inevitable. Our top story this evening: New video has emerged of the Paris gunmen who attacked the magazine Charlie Hebdo shouting, ""we have avenged the Prophet Muhammad."" Still to come: Can England’s schools cope with the growing number of children? Later on BBC London: After a mini tornado damages a garage in west London, we’ll have details of more disruptive weather coming our way. And how London plays a key role in the current series of Silent Witness - we speak to the programme’s star, Emilia Fox. Tony Blair has said the Northern Ireland peace process would probably have collapsed without a controversial scheme for Republican paramilitary suspects. The former Prime Minister has been giving evidence to MPs investigating the on-the-runs process whereby, from 1999, letters were sent to over 200 people suspected of paramilitary offences to assure them they would not face arrest on UK soil. Many of the them were connected to over 300 murders during the Troubles. The existence of the letters came to light last year during a collapsed trial for the Hyde Park bombing in 1982. Our political correspondent, Carole Walker, reports. Summoned to parliament after months of delay. The former Prime Minister defended the scheme to inform Republican suspects they were no longer wanted by police. It was he said, ""crucialfot longer wanted by police. It was he said, ""crucial fot Northern Ireland peace process."" It was not an amnesty. It was not secret, but it nonetheless dealt only with part of the problem that we had to deal with. Many knew nothing about the scheme until last year, when the trial of this man, john Downey, for the 1982 Hyde Park bombing, collapsed much he produced and official letter from 2007. Indicating he would not be prosecuted. The letter was sent in error. Mr Downey walked free. Four soldiers and seven horses were killed when a nail bomb exploded as members of the Household Cavalry made their way to the Changing of the Guard. The attack that took place here, 32 years ago, is one of the most serious of many unsolved IRA bombings. The question of what should happen to those suspected of such crimes remains sensitive. The families of the victims want to know if secret deals were done to allow suspected terrorists to escape justice. I wonder if you want to take an opportunity now to turn round to those victims and to apologise to them for the catastrophic error that you’re Government was involved in that allowed for someone, a fugitive, to have evade justice I take responsibility. I feel sorry for those people. Iapologise responsibility. I feel sorry for those people. I apologise to those people who have suffered as a result of that. But I’m not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received those letters, because without having done that, we would not have a Northern Ireland peace process in place today. Those families gave their response. I think both myself and the otherfamilies their response. I think both myself and the other families were impacted by the Downey case appreciated the fact that Tony Blair appeared in person before the Select Committee and also the fact that he took full responsibility as well as apologising for the mistake that allowed Downey to walk free. Tony Blair pointed out under the Good Friday Agreement, which he negotiated, many of those convicted of bombings and shootings were released early from prison. He said the arrangement to inform suspects who were no longer wanted was fundamental to keeping the peace process going. Without it, we’d be dealing with more Northern Ireland terrorism today. Carole Walker, BBC News, Westminster. With almost a million more children expected to attend school in England in the next decade, there’s a warning that schools will reach a tipping point where there is no money or space to expand any further. The Local Government Association wants ministers to give councils more funding and powers to open new schools, as our education correspondent, Alex Forsyth, reports. A harmonious moment when pupils at this primary get together. 15 years ago, there were half as many and this school in north-West London is still growing. In a few years there’ll be more than 600 pupils, on a site built for 250. This will be six new classrooms and a new office block. To accommodate the extra numbers, they’re building on part of the playground. We have to manage play times with PE, only having one school hall for 660 pupils will be an issue. We’ll continue to be an outstanding school, doing the best for our children and their families, but we have to think differently. In England, schools have been expanding for years to meet demand largely caused by a spike in the birth rate. There’s no similar problem in Scotland or Wales. Last year in England, an extra 90,000 places were created, but the Local Government Association says the pressure is unsustainable with 900,000 more places needed over the next decade, which could cost £12 billion. We’re simply reaching the point where we can’t physically fit any more children into many of our existing schools and that’s why we’re reaching that tipping point. If we are to provide the school places that we need, over the next 10 years, we need a wave of completely new primary schools. For parents applying for places in sought after schools can be stressful. It was anxious for us because as parents we want them to go to a good school. We were glad that he got into this school. I didn’t apply for this one, I applied somewhere else, but that was the only option I got. Labour say thousands of schools are already over capacity, but the Conservatives blame the previous Government for failing to plan for the baby boom. And, along with the Lib Dems, point to £5 billion this Government spent on extra school places with more money promised to meet future demand. For September 2015, 90% of places needed are either in existence or underway and we will work with local authorities, as we have done in previous years, to fill that remaining gap. But as these pupils move from primary to secondary school, the pressure on places will grow with them and so too the challenge for future governments to meet the demand. Alex Forsyth, BBC News. Morrisons has become the latest supermarket chain to announce that its sales fell over the Christmas period. They were down by 3.1% on the previous year- the worst figures of all the UK’s big supermarkets. The company’s chief executive, Dalton Philips, says he’ll step down in March after five years in charge. The supermarket will also close ten loss-making stores. You may know him as the Man with No Name, Dirty Harry, or for one of the dozens of other roles he has played or films he has directed. Legendary actor and Oscar-winning director, Clint Eastwood, is still a major player in Hollywood, in a career spanning 60 years and which has just seen him complete his latest film. Our arts editor, Will Gompertz, went to Los Angeles to meet him. Bradley Cooper, as military marksman, Chris Kyle, in American Sniper. I’ve got a military aged male on a cell phone. Latest film from iconic actor turned Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood. I’m not a guy who is fond of the war in Iraq, but I was always sympathetic to veterans, people who are forced to go do the job whatever the morality aspects of it are. He’s one of those guys who trouble always hunted down. You’ve got some sort of complex? Ijust want to get the bad guys, but if I can’t see, I can’t shoot them. All these guys, they know your name. They feel invincible with you up there. They’re not. I didn’t try to make it that that was the greatest deed in the world any more than I did a movie Unforgiven, based upon somebody who was haunted by having these deeds that he’d done that were despicable. It’s a hell of a thing, killing a man. You take away all he’s got, and all he’s ever gonna have. There’s this constant sort of theme of exploring violence and what it does to people? Right. And the place it has in the world. Do you ever tire of it, as a subject? No. Because it is. .. It’s an important subject and what it does to people and what it’s constantly doing now. Do you have any concerns that, in light of what happened in Paris, storytelling is going to become a more difficult thing to do in the future? I doubt it. It’s sad because people are out there trying to make a life, satire and that stuff has always been with it, but it’s a sad situation for mankind. Clint Eastwood said he was going to take some time out, he owed to his family, after which he will be back, quite possibly with another film that explores the affect that violence has on people’s lives and our culture. Time for a look at the weather, here’s Nick Miller. ~ I have The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. Did you see what I did there? White is the snow.

And, developers at London’s newest public space are accused of limiting public access. Good evening. The funerals have taken place in Paris and jerusalem of seven of the people killed in last week’s attacks in the French capital. All have been given the country’s highest honour, the Legion d’honneur. In a solemn ceremony in Paris for the three police officers who lost their lives, President Hollande said they had died so that France could live in freedom. Two of the officers were shot at the magazine, Charlie Hebdo. The front cover of its first edition since the attacks depicts a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad, an image which is included in this report from our Special Correspondent, Fergal Keane France FFBFICE TTIOUFFIS. FFBFICE I’âf’I’Iâf’|'Ii3âiâS. France mourns. France remembers. And France follows. To the slow rhythm of the funeral drum. The dead were the children of different cultures. Native born and immigrant. But all went by the common name of French. An editor grieving murdered friends. A voice ragged with grief for her murdered daughter. And a President responds, not as a politician, but as a fallen. TRANSLATION: I express mY as a fallen. TRANSLATION: I express my gratitude and also my pride. Because of you, with you, France is still standing. Long live the Republic. Long live France. Today, the dead were given France’s highest award. The Legion of honour. The Muslim policeman killed defending free speech was buried outside Paris. God is great, a voice cried, as he was carried to his grave, in this people’s ceremony. Today, it emerged how his killers had revelled in their violence. ""We have avenged the prophet Mohammed."" She shouted. This new video shows them after they attacked Charlie Hebdo. A murderous nonchalance as they got ready to escape. Then the fire as they drove towards a police vehicle. And then disappeared. In the face of that reglessness, France has promised tough action. Singing the anthem Born in Revolution the politicians projected an image of uninimity. The National Anthem was sung in the Assembly for the first time since the end of the great war and from the increasingly popular far right, this demand for radical action. TRANSLATION: popular far right, this demand for radicalaction. TRANSLATION: Islamic radical action. TRANSLATION: Islamic fundamentalism radicalaction. TRANSLATION: Islamic fundamentalism is the cancer of Islam. This is the reason why we have to reraed indicate the cancerous cells. If we do not, the great danger is they will multiply. Nearly a week after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the divisions in this society are being more openly vocalised. The defence of free speech has been emphatic and supported by many Muslims. But there are, among some younger men, growing expressions of anger. TRANSLATION: This has really affected us. They’ve attacked our prophet. He’s part of us. At the moment we’re calm, but they keep provoking us. You can’t go far like this. For the journalists who defied the threats ofjihadi groups, this is the reality. Working under armed guard. groups, this is the reality. Working underarmed guard. Entering under armed guard. Entering the temporary headquarters of Charlie Hebdo, visiting reporters are searched. The magazine hasn’t been silenced. This first edition since the man Kerr has a print run 50 times its normal size and a defiant front page. A cartoon of the prophet with the words, ""Allis front page. A cartoon of the prophet with the words, ""All is forgiven."" This is the cramped temporary office that was put together by the surviving staff. Less than a week ago, Patrick was first on the scene trying to save wounded friends. Now he’s the public face of Charlie Hebdo. TRANSLATION: This terrorist attack which killed 17 has touched France and not only Charlie Hebdo. They touched all Europe and all democracy. Most of the French Muslims I’ve spoken with have said they’re outraged by the attack on you and the violence and support free speech, but also say that frequently they’re appalled by the characterisations of their religion in your magazine. TRANSLATION: This is a vast debate, but Mohammed has been featured in our present museums since the Middle Ages. There’s nothing against Muslims. Terrorists do not speak on behalf of the Koran. This will hit the news stands early tomorrow. I’ve been given an advance copy. Besides the cartoon of the prophet, there’s also crude sexual satire, mainly directed at extremist Muslims, but also at the Pope. In the editorial here the newspaper is bitterly critical of politicians who failed to support it in the past, using bracing language to tell them where to go. And it also criticises those who insinuated that Charlie Hebdo brought violence on itself. France tonight, there’s no mistaking the mood of national grief, but also deep anger. Funerals for the four people killed in Paris at a kosher supermarket have taken place injerusalem. Senior politicians joined the hundreds of people who attended. Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told the mourners the victims had returned to their true home, but their lives had been cut down by hatred. Our Middle East Editorjeremy Bowen was there. Not long before dawn, the men’s bodies were brought here from Paris. France has the biggestjewish community in Europe, with strong links to Israel. Their funerals were held injerusalem. One of the four, Yohan Cohen, worked in the kosher supermarket that was attacked. The others, Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham and Francois-Michel Saada, were shopping on the eve of the jewish Sabbath. ""Protect me, Philippe"", said his widow, Valerie. After the condolences, Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told the mourners that radical Islam was the enemy, notjust of Israel, but of the whole world. The European jews who founded modern Israel believed they had to rely on themselves for protection. Bad times forjews abroad often means more immigrants for Israel. In this country, that’s seen as a transfusion of strength. Mark and Gary travelled from Paris to mourn their friend, Francois-Michel Saada. On Sunday there was a huge demonstration, you know, something magnificent, but the fact is, it looked like a party, what’s going on after this? Somebody told me last night that the onlyjews that survived the World War II horror were the pessimistics. I think it’s maybe safer to be pessimistic than over optimistic, but anyway, we don’t have any reason to be over optimistic. The killings in Paris have sharpened old fears that are buried deep inside manyjews and that is because of a long history of persecution, especially in Europe, and that feeds into one of the founding beliefs here in Israel which is, that the country has to stay strong, that it can’t afford to let down its guard. The four men were buried next to each other. Israel’s prime minister has been criticised by some here for exploiting their deaths, to look strong ahead of elections in March. But in Israel, whenjews are killed, just because they’re jews, here or abroad, their deaths often create political consequences, as well as personal tragedies. jeremy Bowen, BBC News, jerusalem. Over to Fergal keen in France. Where does France go from this? The sense of national shock is beginning to abate. What really strikes me, even listening to the rhetoric of someone like Marine Le Pen. To separate Islam from radical Islam is the question. To avoid the kind of loose language or inflamatory comments that would provoke serious divisions here. Of course, key to all of this will be the ability of the French secret services to prevent any future mass casualty attacks. They could certainly deepen divisions in this society. You’ll look for example to what happened in Britain in the wake of the 7/7 attacks nearly ten years ago, where there was a concerted effort, politically and in many other respects, to reach out to Muslim communities and to make sure that the security services were getting more information and also to look at issues like radicalisation and education and in the prisons. You’re going to see a great deal of discussion and debate in frnce about that in the coming weeks. Inflation is at its lowest level for 14 years. It fell sharply in December to 0.5%, thanks to the falling price of oil and the lower cost of food. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, says it’s good news for most of us in the short term and may fall further. Our Economics Editor, Robert Peston, has more. The price of the fuel that powers a nation has fallen more than 10% over the past year and is the big reason why inflation has dropped to its joint lowest level since records began in 1989. With the reduction in the prices, opened up people’s opportunities and perhaps, because of the trend, helped reinforce the confidence that the economy was already demonstrating. Infact, inflation is so low, more than 1% below the 2% official target, that this man, the governor of the Bank of England, is obliged to write a letter explaining what’s happened to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. So would you expect inflation to fall even further given what’s been happening to oil prices? Given what has happened, and what’s in the pipeline, so to speak, with oil prices, and the petrol price, you can expect the petrol price to fall further, and we would expect the CPI to continue to drift down in coming months. No tears about falling prices on Teesside. You know, it’s expensive to run a car at the best of times. So any savings that you do get are mostly appreciated. Yeah, definitely. It’s about £5 difference, you know what I mean, but every little penny in my pocket is better than in somebody else’s pocket, isn’t it? I think people will use their cars more. More again, yes. It’s been a long time coming. A long time coming, yeah. It wasn’t that long ago that inflation was massively above target. But today, along with oil, food prices have been dropping, as have shoes and clothing. Could prices drop for other goods and services? Could we have deflation that encouraged us to delay our spending in the hope of getting bargains, that could tip the economy into a intractable slump. How big a risk is there that this good low inflation becomes pernicious deflation? I think there’s not very much of a risk, but the real question is - does it tell us that the world economy is slowing much more than we all thought six months or so ago? I don’t think that’s the case. Personally, I think some of this is to do with particular features in the oil market. Secondly, in the case of food prices, it’s to do with the weather and harvests. But, if I were still on the Monetary Policy Committee, I’d be looking very hard at the global economy and I’d certainly be looking at whether there’s any danger that this is going to feed through into even lower wage rises. Obviously, I understand that these things are never definite. What we might see here is interest rates at lower levels for longer. So if we were sitting down a year ago I’d think, relative to my expectations at the time, I’d think, yes, lower than I would have expected, but I think it’s important that will One of the major energy firms - E.ON - is cutting its standard gas tariff by 3.5%, reducing the average household bill by £24 a year. E.ON supplies gas and electricity to four-and-a-half million homes in the UK. Energy companies have been under pressure to cut their bills to reflect falling wholesale prices. Morrisons has become the latest supermarket to announce a fall in sales over Christmas. They were down by 3.1% on the previous year- the worst performance of all the UK’s big supermarkets.

The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has told MPs the Northern Ireland peace process would probably have collapsed without a controversial scheme for Republican paramilitary suspects. Around 200 people - so called on-the-runs - were sent letters assuring them they were not wanted by the police. They included a man accused of involvement in a bombing in Hyde Park in 1982 that killed four soldiers. Our political correspondent, Carole Walker, reports. Summoned to Parliament after months of delay. The former Prime Minister defended the scheme to inform Republican suspects they were no longer wanted by police. It was, he said, crucial to the Northern Ireland peace process. It was not an amnesty. It was not secret, but it nonetheless dealt only with part of the problem that we had to deal with. But the details only became public last year when the trial of this man, john Downey, for the 1982 Hyde Park bombing, collapsed. He’d received an official letter telling him, ""the police in Northern Ireland are not aware of any interest in you by any other police force."" It was sent in error, but Mr Downey walked free. Four soldiers and seven horses were killed when a nail bomb exploded as members of the Household Cavalry made their way to the Changing of the Guard.

But I am not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received those letters because, without having done that, we would not have a Northern Ireland peace process in place today.

Egypt’s highest court has overturned the only remaining conviction against the former president, Hosni Mubarak, who’s serving a three-year sentence for embezzlement. The court in Cairo found that legal procedures had not been properly followed though it’s not yet clear whether the decision means Mr Mubarak will be released. The European Parliament has voted to allow member states to choose whether or not to grow genetically modified crops. It could pave the way for them to be grown in England. GM crops have been highly restricted in Europe, with only one variety of maize allowed. Several countries, including the UK, have been calling for the ban to be lifted. Our science editor, David Shukman, reports. In a lab in Hertfordshire tonight, a line of wheat plants, each modified with extra genes to help them absorb carbon dioxide and so increase their yield of grains. The Government believes this genetic science has huge potential, which is why it pays for it. So the European Union’s decision to allow more freedom on using GM is warmly welcomed here. As a scientists, I see it as a way of removing the logjam we’ve seen over the last 10 to 15 years in Europe and allowing the fruits of our labour in the lab to become applied in the field. To make new crop varieties that need less pesticides, lest herbicides and can produce more food from less land. For years, GM crops have attracted opposition. Environmental groups portraying them as potentially dangerous. Consumers have felt nervous. The European Union has been paralysed. The latest field trials had to be guarded. Scientists say GM could feed a growing population in a warming world, but until now European countries that wanted them were blocked. I open the vote. Now, after years of haggling, today’s vote in the European Parliament means individual governments can now choose whether to allow GM. Today’s decision does open a new door for GM plants like these, but there won’t be a rush for them. That’s because many European governments remain adamantly opposed to this technology. So does Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the supermarkets aren’t keen either. So for anyone working in this field, there’s still an uphill struggle. A purple tomato, genetically modified to contain all the health benefits of blueberries. A key question with GM is public attitude. Campaigners argue that the risks simply aren’t worth it. There’s absolutely no evidence we need GM crops to feed the world. They’ve promised huge amounts, in terms of increased yields, drought resistant, salt resistant crops and we don’t have that in reality. The only GM crops we have on the table, grown commercially, are animal feeds, essentially. Tonight, the experiments continue. The wheat plants bathed in artificial light. The march of science is set to create plants with new abilities. What’s less certain is how widely they’ll be accepted. David Shukman, BBC News in Hertfordshire. Pope Francis has arrived in Sri Lanka at the start of a three-day visit. For a quarter of a century, the country was torn apart by a civil war that killed as many as a 100,000 people. The Pope began his visit by calling for reconciliation between all faiths of the country, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian. Our religious affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, is travelling with the Pope and sent this report from the capital, Colombo. Even at 20,000 feet, Pope Francis knows how to work a room. High in the heavens above Europe, on the papal plane, he greeted the Vatican Press Pack, flying with him on this visit to Asia. Caroline Wyatt, the BBC. I asked the Pope what he expected from this trip? ""Let’s see"", he said, with a smile, and moved on. After the long flight from Rome, Pope Francis arrived to a warm greeting from Sri Lanka’s new president, who’s promised an end to the repression of religious minorities here. This is a nation that wants a more harmonious future after a conflict that ended just five years ago. The Pope urged people here to confront that difficult past. The process of healing also needs to include the pursuit of truth, not for the sake of opening old wounds, but rather as necessary means of promoting justice, healing and unity. For more than a quarter of a century some of the Tamil minority fought for independence from the majority Senegalese, the war between rebels and government forces causing tens of thousands of civilian deaths. For many, the wounds of that war are still raw. That’s one reason the Pope’s visit has delighted many here, who travelled miles to see him, calling it a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I think it’s a miracle because it’s very happy. I got tears to my eyes. I can’t imagine that. No more to say about that. just under 10% here are Catholic, but many more gathered to see the first Pope to visit Sri Lanka in a generation. Security here is tight for every event that the Pope is due to attend. The elections here passed off far more peacefully than anyone could have hoped, but there is still much trust to be rebuilt across the ethnic and religious divides. Like St Francis, his name sake, this Pope has brought a message of hope, but where there was discord, there can be peace. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News, Colombo. The legendary actor and Oscar-winning director, Clint Eastwood, is still a major player in Hollywood, aged 84 and with a career spanning 60 years. He’s just completed his latest film. In an exclusive interview in Los Angeles, he’s been talking to our arts editor, Will Gompertz, about his movie and about the level of violence overall in Hollywood films, particularly in the light of events in Paris last week. Bradley Cooper, as military marksman, Chris Kyle, in American Sniper. I’ve got a military-aged male on a cell phone watching the convoy. Over. The latest film from iconic actor, turned Oscar-winning director, Clint Eastwood. I’m not a guy who is fond of the war in Iraq, but I was always sympathetic to veterans, people who are forced to go do the job whatever the morality aspects of it are. He’s one of those guys that trouble always hunted down. You’ve got some sort of saviour complex? Ijust want to get the bad guys, but if I can’t see them, I can’t shoot them. Look, all these guys, they know your name and they feel invincible with you up there. They’re not. I didn’t try to make it that that was the greatest deed in the world any more than... I did a movie, Unforgiven, based upon somebody who was haunted by having these deeds that he’d done, that were despicable. It’s a hell of a thing, killing a man. You take away all he’s got, and all he’s ever gonna have. There’s this constant sort of theme of exploring violence and what it does to people? Right. And the place it has in the world. Do you ever tire of it, as a subject? No. Because it is... It’s an important subject and what it does to people and what it’s constantly doing now. I mean... Do you have any concerns that, in light of what happened in Paris, storytelling is going to become a more difficult thing to do in the future? I doubt it. It’s sad because people are out there trying to make a life and satire, that stuff has always been with it, but it’s a sad situation for mankind. Clint Eastwood said he was going to take some time out, he owed to his family, after which he will be back, quite possibly with another film that explores the affect that violence has on people’s lives and our culture. Will Gompertz, BBC News, Hollywood. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Riz Lateef. Two thirds of London buses have been off the road today after drivers went on strike over pay - affecting hundreds of thousands of commuters. Union members want the 18 different companies, which run the capital’s bus services, to give all drivers similar pay. Transport for London says that could cost up to £100 million a year. Our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards reports. Brixton at the end of the Victoria line, where tonight there’s been a long wait for a bus. It’s taken me two-and-a-half hours to get to work and three quarters of an hour to get to here. They’ve onlyjust increased bus fares and now they go on strike. It’s appalling. We’re not happy at all. Buses that did run were packed. It was a similar story this morning. It’s very inconvenient. When you live here, Crouch End you’ve got no other choice but to get a bus, so no other way of getting into work. There should be a right to - other way of getting into work. There should be a right to - for people to demonstrate, or strike against pay, but I think people need to be realistic. And this is why. Bus drivers want equal pay. Rome wasn’t built in a day. We know one day won’t change things, but it’s getting the word across. It’s about the pay. That’s why we’re here today. Equal pay for one and all. Services in London are run by different companies. Transport for London sets the fares and timetables, but not pay, so one driver can be earning £17,000 a year, with another earning £28,000. Companies say they can only be responsible for their own drivers. It’s like me working for Sainsbury’s and trying to go to negotiate Tesco rates. I can only be responsible for the people who work for me. The problem we have at the moment, TfL, in line with the Government are are cutting budgets. That’s not being passed on to the shareholders, whose margins are growing and that’s being picked up by the drivers. The Mayor says it will cost £100 million if PHY says it will cost £100 million if pay is standardised and that would mean cuts to services. And he thinks strikes should only be allowed if 40% of the workforce vote for it. You see the point, you are letting the politics get in the way of the strike and you should sort the strike out? No, it’s up to the bus companies and get on and sort out the strike and it’s worth making the point that this strike would not now be going ahead if we had the restriction, which I think is a very modest one in place and it’s something that other great cities have done and we should consider doing it in London too. Transport for London said it managed to run one third of services, but at the moment a solution to this dispute seems unreachable. Tom is here now. What’s your assessment? The latest from Transport for London is that there was significant disruption, but 90% of usual commuters used public transport today. One third of bus services ran as we heard there. That was higher than was thought initially. I think the companies will be pleased about that. The unions will be quietly pleased, because this message about pay disparity, that’s also out there. I don’t think a lot of people knew ",,

The developers behind London’s newest public space on top of the so called Walkie-Talkie Tower in the City have been accused of going back on their word by limiting public access. They’ve introduced a ticketing system. And, some other problems have emerged for the Sky Garden, as Alex Bushill reports. We filmed on our phones and you can visit here free of charge, but only if you book a ticket in advance. If you tried tonight, you would have to wait until March to come here, which is also when this viewing platform will be open to the public. We asked an award-winning urban architect for his assessment. It’s more like an airport launch. The last thing they want is a buggy and scooter or a tramp, so is that really a public space? I don’t think so. The building’s developers refused to be interviewed, but defended policies in a statement saying their airport security and ticketing system was designed to protect visitors and control numbers. Not everyone is convinced. The City of London, which granted them planning permission, had a meeting today and I’ve learnt that’s because they’re so concerned about what was promised and what has now been delivered. As well as promising public access, they promised a garden for the public. This is it. These are the formal gardens that make up this garden. A bank of terracing with palms. I’ve counted just over 12. The rest is ferns and shrubbery. Is this then a green space? There’s probably as much marble, glass and steel as there is foiliage. This is a building that melted parked cars in the summer sunshine and it’s now suffering inside with the winter winds. Listen to this. That loud whistling is the wind rushing about the building and it’s so cold, that the staff wear ski jumpers and hats and they told me that’s to benefit the plants, which by the way are ferns and suck lents. Either way, the corporation has now set they will ensure the developers honour their commitments. Time for the weather. All sorts going on over the next 48 hours. Some of us might wake up to this, because there is an active band of showers that’s already brought snow to the West Country and hail, thunder and lightning and it’s heading this way. It’s going to be very close to the M25 south of London first thing tomorrow. If it falls as rain, well through the night, the temperature will fall backin night, the temperature will fall back in the clearer spells low enough for that rain to create some ice on untreated surfaces too. All in all, I should leave a bit of extra time first thing. I don’t think it will settle in London. As we go through the day, it’s not looking too bad. The wind will be picking up all through the day, though and then comes the next thing. A lot of rain. 20-40 millimetres. Very gusty winds too. Perhaps up to 60mph. That could be disruptive as well. Wednesday night into Thursday. A warning in place for that. We have similar sorts of difficulties elsewhere across the country. Over for the national bmmu country. Over for the national forecast to Nick. If hail, sleet and snow wasn’t enough, even reports of mini tornadoes in Pembrokeshire and west London today and these are the recent lightning strikes. It’s not just snowing, but thunder and lightning too. It doesn’t often happen. There is so much energy with the showers. Blue rain and white snow and more of these are turning to white as more snowjust on hills, but to low levels out of the showers falls. Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England and Wales, through the Midlands and south-west England and some right through the southern counties through night. They are giving a covering of snow on hills, but even to lower levels, with temperatures like this, so widespread ice tomorrow. Much of the country is covered by yellow warnings for snow and ice. We have the next level up in Scotland. That’s amber. Be prepared. Central lowlands and another batch of snow showers moving through in the morning, adding to the snow we have already got. Some of the snow showers too for Northern Ireland and northern England. Tomorrow morning could be a difficult commute. The showers easing across the south as the day begins, but they’ll have left a covering on hills. Even to lower levels. The snow showers tomorrow will slowly fade from northern England and clear from Scotland, but then a quieter spell of weather, but the lull is too brief, because we look to the west. Another spell of wet and windy weather is coming our way. Milder air associated with this. It may start briefly at hill snow in places. More rain to Northern Ireland. Rain and snow melting in Scotland and downpours in Wales and the south-west on saturated ground. We’ll see the heavy rain at some stage tomorrow night. If only it was rain. Wind too. Up to 70mph gusts on exposed coasts in the south-west and Irish Sea. It’s stormy again tomorrow night, as the swathe of rain sweeps east across the UK. As we start Thursday, still close to the deep area of low pressure. In Scotland, Northern Ireland, maybe north-west England, disruptive winds on Thursday, as heavy showers sweep south along with the colder air coming back. So, if it’s snow and ice tonight and into the morning, if it’s rain and gales tomorrow night and into Thursday, there’s going to be some travel disruption. Welcome to Thailand!

Thousands more passengers face a first day of disruption, due to work at London Bridge Station. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Both London and Paris have been reviewing their security procedures in the wake of the terror attacks in France last week. The French government is mobilising 10,000 troops to boost security, and will send thousands of police to protect jewish schools. Here, David Cameron held a meeting in Downing Street focusing on key issues such as the level of cooperation between the police and the military in the event of an attack. The threat level here remains unchanged at severe, which means MI5 believes an attack is highly likely. In a moment we’ll be getting the latest from Paris, but first here’s our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. just after dawn this morning, the Home Secretary, intelligence, military and security chiefs converged on ten Downing St to brief David Cameron on the current terrorist threat to Britain. Last week’s armed attacks in Paris has prompted a rethink back here. Could Britain cope with something similar? The attacks in Paris once again demonstrated the scale of the terrorist threat that we face and the need to have robust powers through our intelligence and said it would to agencies and policing in order to keep our people safe. French counterterrorist police acted swiftly and decisively to end two hostage siege is simultaneously. But what are the lessons to be learned? To Britain Kindersley -- what are the lessons to be learned? To Britain Kindersley -- Britton’s contingency plans need to be revised? The UK terror alert level is currently severe, the second-highest, meaning an attack is highly likely. Andrew Parker, head of MI5, revealed last week that three terrorist plots have recently been stopped but warned, we cannot hope to stop everything. The London bombings ten years ago were an example of that happening, the blackest day in MI5’s recent history. This week, security has been increased at the UK - history. This week, security has been increased at the UK - France border, especially to stop weapons being brought in. There are increased patrols at St Pancras station. There are also controversial moves to increase surveillance of fibre communications. How do international terrorist to communicate with each other, those in Britain with those in Yemen, Afghanistan? They communicate through the Internet. Unless the intelligence agencies are able, also through the Internet, to find out what the bad guys are plotting, then we are all in danger. The nightmare scenario for any country is a repeat of the Mumbai raid in 2008, when heavily armed gunmen rampaged through the city, killing over 160 people. Some fear the Government’s measures could go too far. Political parties are all too often fearful of being accused of being soft on terrorism, and sometimes hammering the not hard is not the way to deal with things. We have to be proportionate and protect the things that are valuable to society. Britain has few on to police and many countries, partly because there are fewer guns here, but, after Paris, plans are being revised to cope with even the worst contingencies. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor Norman Smith. Are the security services going to get more powers as a result of what happened in front? The security services are already getting more powers agreed ahead of the atrocities in Paris, it yet in the power to seize people ‘s passport if they feel they are going to travel to Syria, stopping airlines from landing if they do not hand over details of the passengers on board, but the Prime Minister is of the opinion that those powers, in the wake of Paris, are not enough. He wants to revive what critics call the snooper’s Charter, which would enable security services to see what we are looking at on the Internet, to read our conversations on social media. There is no prospect of that being agreed before the election because of the opposition of the Liberal Democrats, but after it, David Cameron said, if re-elected, he would seek to reintroduce that legislation. I suspect it would be difficult to get through Parliament notjust because of the opposition of the Liberal Democrats and Labour party, but because of doubts within his own party. It is the age-old conundrum of how far you have to compromise Civil Liberties to protect Civil Liberties, how far to strengthen the rights of the state to protect the rights of the individual. Many thanks. Meanwhile, France is to carry an unprecedented deployment of troops within the country. They’ll be in place in sensitive areas from tomorrow evening. Here’s our correspondent, Christian Fraser. It was an extraordinary coming together, a mark of solidarity and defiance many say has not been seen in France since the Second World War. Today, France returns to the working week wounded and fragile. Still, decidedly anxious. First thing, the president called another emergency meeting. His Prime Minister has deployed 5000 soldiers and police to protect 700 jewish schools around the country. It is thought a school a few hundred meters from the Paris supermarket was the preferred target. The threat is still present, said the Prime Minister, the work continues. We believe that most probably there was at least one accomplice. In the media, recriminations have begun over the monitoring of the three gunmen shot dead. The Kouachi brothers were on a US - three gunmen shot dead. The Kouachi brothers were on a US - UK watchlist. One was convicted, and Hayat Boumeddiene is known to have left the country on january the 2nd, flying from Paris to Madrid and then on to Turkey. She crossed into Syria to join on to Turkey. She crossed into Syria tojoin Islamic State the day on to Turkey. She crossed into Syria to join Islamic State the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack. At the weekend, coolly Bali’s final video appeared online. In Paris, investigators have found his hideaway, an apartment filled with automatic weapons, detonators, and cash. One of the supermarket hostages says he was carrying a camera and we moved the disc in the shop to edit it on a computer he bought. A criminal background, the target, the modus operandi, we have seen it all before. It is a copycat of Toulouse, 2012. The main target there was a jewish school. Amedi Coulibaly was radicalised in prison. He had known Cherif Kouachi for ten years, they served together in Europe’s biggest prison, where they were schooled by a jihadists preacher. Today, the Prime Minister said France would begin isolating its Islamist detainees to prevent jails from being used as a future breeding ground for terror. And there’s much more on the Paris attacks and their aftermath, including a special report on last week’s events, on the BBC News website. That’s at bbc.co.uk/parisattack. Nearly two million people retiring in the early years of the new flat-rate pension will not qualify for the full amount. The new pension is being launched in April next year and is likely to be worth about £150 a week, compared with the current basic pension of £113. Our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz reports. Sold as simple and fair, the new single pension will make together today’s confusing array of payments but existing pensioners will not get it and now it is clear how many covered workers who will be future pensioners will not get it in full. You will need 35 years of national insurance contributions or credit, or you will get less, and if you have had some of your national insurance paid into a Private scheme, you will end up with less as well. I think many people will be surprised with this. We have heard all of these messages about the universal state pension, and when they get their many people will be surprised they do not get the full amount. Government figures, obtained aftera amount. Government figures, obtained after a Freedom of information request, show only 45% of those reaching pension age in the five years after the launch in 2016 will get the amount. 1 million people will find their pensions are more than 15% lower than the flat rate. You have to see this in the light of the new pension freedoms which are coming in this year. From the age of 55, you will be able to spend your pension savings as you like, on a Lamborghini, if you want, which is what the Pensions Minister said, rather than keeping the money locked up. If you do spend it and your state pension is less than you expect, you could end up in a financial hole. The Lamborghini Minister says no-one will miss out. The basic principle of the new system is we compare what people would have got under the old rules and what they will get under the new rules based on their record of national insurance and we start with the high list of those two, so language of missing out is complete nonsense -- language of missing out is complete nonsense -- start with the highest of those will stop the transition from the old system to the new one will take decades. In that time, some who are retiring will find that they get less state pension than those of similar age. More than 1,000 British farmers won’t be paid for their milk today because of a financial crisis at a British dairy. First Milk, a farmer-owned cooperative, is asking its members to accept a delayed payment because of cash-flow problems. Farmers’ leaders say this is unacceptable and warn that many dairy farmers are leaving the industry. Our correspondent Victoria Fritz reports. It is one of Britain’s’s biggest derrick operatives and has a multi-million pound cash flow problem. First Milk want its farmers to bail it out. The firm says it needs the cash to put the business on a stronger platform, but farmers say withholding payment stretches the collaborative ethos of the Co-operative to the limit. If you are a dairy farmer with bills to pay and do not receive money into your bank, unless you have a very favourable bank manager, this could mean a very, very stressful time. The cooperative says it is working with banks to explain its decision, but Britain has lost 60 fairy producers in December alone. The majority do not make a profit on the milk they produce. In some cases, like First Milk’s suppliers, they are losing money. So, why is the price of milk falling? Milk production has wizard. It might be a distant memory, but we had a good summer, how produced a lot of milk. Globally, prices are at their lowest level since 2007. The sustained price war between the biggest supermarkets have not helped. In some cases, milk is now cheaper than bottled water, but retailers said they take the hit on cheap milk rather than passing the price cut onto the dairies. The payment delay, we are told, is temporarily, but no one can tell the farmers how long it will last. Ina few In a few hours, NHS England will announce the result of a review of the cancer drugs fund, which is expected to announce restrictions on the number of treatment it will fund, which is expected to be controversial. Our health editor Hugh Pym is with me. The fund was meant to get more drugs out of people but is proving expensive. Is it more pressure on the NHS? It is part of the story of increasing demand on the NHS. Patience, quite understandably, want access to the very best that is out there, and because there were different stories in different parts of the country with some patients getting access and some not, David Cameron set up the cancer drugs fund for England when he took office in 2010, the idea being to fund drug is not normally available on the NHS. Initially, there was a budget of £200 million per year. As more and more people became aware of it, it had to be increased to £280 million. Last year, 550,000 patients benefited from it. There are predictions it could overspend by £100 million per year or more if there are not reforms, which is what is being looked at. Options this afternoon could include cutting the number of drugs available, such as bowel cancer treatment and eight breast cancer drug. NHS England is saying a line has to be drawn somewhere. It raises bigger question is, what should the taxpayer be paving is, what should the taxpayer be paying for to prolong someone’s life by six or a year? Was the cancer drugs fund, in essence, a short-term solution to a longer-term problem? The drug companies knew they could get away with charging more for these drugs than otherwise would have been possible. Many thanks. Divers have recovered the flight data recorder from the Air Asia plane that crashed into the java Sea two weeks ago. The cockpit voice recorder has not been retrieved, but search teams say they now know where it is. Our correspondent Karishma Vaswani sent this report. A major breakthrough in the search to find some answers as to why the AirAsia plane crashed into the java Sea. This is the Kraft’s flight data recorder, dug out from the bottom of the plane plane’s wing. The machine records whether the plane stalled during its flight, how much fuel it had and what attitude was flying at. The flight data recorder will now be handed to Indonesia’s air crash investigators, who will be scouring the data on it to figure out why the plane crashed. These flight data recorders seem good. It will depend on the memory inside, but according to our experience, these flight data recorders can be opened and they can be read when in good condition. That is my experience. But let’s see. Today or to my or tomorrow. But divers are still searching for the cockpit voice recorder. Officials believe they know where it is, based on strong signals the box is producing, but there has been no visual identification of it yet. Contained within the cockpit voice recorder, the conversations of those on-board moments before the plane went down. These details will be invaluable for the relatives of those on board the ill-fated flight. It has now been two weeks since the AirAsia plane went into the java Sea, killing all 162 people on board. It has been a gruelling wait for families anxious to find any answers as to why this plane went down. The discovery of this flight data recorder will hopefully provide some important clues, and give them some semblance of closure.

The attackers went from class to class in a brutal killing spree. It was an act that shocked and traumatised the nation, but today the school reopens with extra security, and a ceremony is being held to remember those who died. Our correspondent Shaimaa Khalil is there. Yes, among YES, BITIOFIQ VâI’y in Peshawar today, the Army public school has reopened its gate for its students. It hasn’t been an easy day for them. And I students. It hasn’t been an easy day forthem. And I must for them. And I must say that non-not all students in Peshawar have gone back to school. We are told that out of the 1300 schools in this city, only 100 and 80 have reopened. Security is tight, and many schools are deploying high walls and barbed wire. Many schools are also putting CCTV cameras in. Many parents are saying they are still quite worried. Despite that, children have gone back to school today, and here is how events happened today for students in Peshawar. It’s a day of mixed emotions here. This is a city still on edge, and in mourning. But now it’s time to go back to school. It’s been a few weeks since the Taliban massacre, and emotions are still raw at the army public school where it happened. The country’s army chief was there to receive pupils and their families on their first day back. Despite the grief, students were excited to return. like this 16-year-old. It was quite emotional. Broke into tears a lot, and the scenes we saw that day, they all returned to us. But we managed to hold ourselves and managed to smile for the people who were there for us. So it was on and off. But yeah, I’m still happy. Were you at all worried before coming back to school? Not at all. We were not at all worried. We were very excited last night. just a little bit emotional because of what happened, but we are very happy to come back here. And this is what he and many of his colleagues had to witness - a Taliban attack in which more than 130 children were killed. Since then, the government has set up military courts and has lifted a moratorium on the death penalty. But many families are still quite anxious, and say the leadership hasn’t done enough to ensure the safety of their children. Despite their worries, many parents in Pakistan have chosen to send their children back to school today. The attack that happened here in Peshawar has shocked the nation, but many say that if the classes remain closed, then the militants have succeeded. There are still many unanswered questions about what happened at the army public school, and whether the country’s security forces can stop another attack like this from happening again. But for these children’s lives to move on, classes will have to resume. And this is the message we have been hearing in Peshawar today, that lives must go on, for the families and for the children, and that classes must restart. But for other families who have had to bury their children after the attack, the memories of their sons are still going to linger on. Many thanks. Nigeria’s military has vowed to retake a strategic town in the north-east of the country after a series of attacks by the Islamist cult Boko Haram. Reports say up to 2,000 people may have been killed. Our correspondent Will Ross sent this report. It’s been a week of horrific violence, the aftermath of a weekend bomb attack in Maiduguri city in which 19 people were killed. Nigerians were shocked when officials said the suicide bomber was a ten-year-old girl. There were two more attacks in the same region just yesterday. The remains of suicide belts were found on the bodies of two young women who carried out an attack in Potiskum. The deadliest of the recent violence has been in and around the town of Baga, close to the border with Chad. Boko Haram jihadists captured a military base there earlier this month, and then went on a killing spree. Those that could fled across the border into safer parts of north-east Nigeria, leaving behind horrific scenes. No one knows how many died in Baga. It’s too dangerous to go and count, let alone bury the dead. But Amnesty International says it could be the group’s worst ever attack. After speaking with several eyewitnesses who told us that Boko Haram went house-to-house, targeting civilians, we believe that what has happened is just the latest in a series of attacks where Boko Haram is attempting to carve out territory in north-eastern Nigeria. Boko Haram’s list of atrocities is long and gruesome. The 219 schoolgirls kidnapped from their dormitories are still missing, nine months on. At gunpoint, they were forced onto trucks and driven away. The violence in the north-east of Nigeria is relentless. Not surprisingly, there are calls for more countries round the world to do more to help in the fight against Boko Haram. Britain and America are training some troops here, but there’s no desire whatsoever to become more deeply involved in this conflict. Elections are due next month, but the jihadist attacks have not really become a national issue, a sign of how divided the north and south of this country are. The politicians have focused on the campaigns. President Goodluckjonathan, who is seeking another term, has not yet commented on the recent bloodshed. Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos. It was a glittering night at the Golden Globe Awards for several British actors. Eddie Redmayne won Best Actor in a Film Drama for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, joanne Froggatt was named Best Supporting Actress in a TV series for her role in Downton Abbey, and Ruth Wilson won Best Actress in a TV Drama for The Affair. Our correspondent, Alistair Leithead, has more. The first of the big award shows, and a lot of famous British faces cramming the red carpet. You can’t turn on the telly without some Brit being in some TV show. I can’t believe it, I’ve never experienced anything like it. It’s crazy. Are you guys ready to have some fun tonight? The Globes is a relaxed affair, with stars roped in to poke fun at North Korea after Sony’s hacking scandal. You love Korea. Everyone knows it. Three Brits were up for Best Actor - Benedict Cumberbatch, David Oyelowo, and the winner was... Eddie Redmayne, The Theory Of Everything. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking won him one of the most coveted prizes of the evening. Getting to spend time with Stephen Hawking, who, despite all of the obstacles put in his way, has lived passionately and fully and with great humour, was one of the great, great honours of my life. Michael Keaton, Birdman. Winning for Best Actor in a comedy, Michael Keaton will be big competition at the Oscars. And the Golden Globe goes to Boyhood. The film made with the same actors over 12 years won three Globes - for Best Drama, Best Actor and Best Director. It means so much to us that people have seen it and responded to it in that personal way. There’s nothing that feels better than that. It feels like we made that connection. George Clooney was given a lifetime achievement award. It’s a humbling thing when you find someone to love. Amal, whatever alchemy it is that brought us together, I couldn’t be more proud to be your husband. And he also paid tribute to the marchers following the attack in Paris. So, je suis Charlie. Thank you. Freedom of expression and speech, a big theme here on the red carpet. It’s such a wonderful symbol. It’s funny how people find the perfect symbol. The symbol of the pen, the pen is mightier than the sword, represents free speech, free art. There’s a huge amount of British talent walking the red carpet this award season. Of course, the Golden Globes isjust act one. It’s six weeks until the Oscars, and the hope for even greater riches to come. Alastair Leithead, BBC News, Los Angeles. Now, injust a few hours’ time, a 25-year-old striker from the Irish club Peamont United will find out if she’s won this year’s Fifa Goal of the Year. Stephanie Roche finds herself up against Robin van Persie of Man United and james Rodrigues of Real Madrid. She scored her goal during Peamont’s match against Wexford Youths, and luckily, it was caught on camera. Natalie Pirks has more. We are taught from an early age to have goals in life. One perfect goal has changed Stephanie Roche’s almost overnight. When she walks this red carpet later, she was an herb growing status as a female role model in a male dominated sport, but she hopes gender will not be the reason for her votes. I am really happy to represent women’s football, but at the end of the day, we will say we want to be recognised as footballers and not our gender. A lot of people have thought about the goal and how good the technical ability is. I am happy to see that, rather than to say, that was a great girl who’s got that great goal. That it was captured on camera at all is a miracle. just 95 people, but now millions more on the internet watched in amazement as Roche took three touches before unleashing a volley so perfect that it nearly took the net with it. But new-found fame has certainly not brought her the wealth of her fellow nominees. Robin van Persie’s flying header for the Netherlands was watched by millions in Brazil. And Real Madrid paid more than £60 million for Colombianjames Rodriguez, after Colombian james Rodriguez, after this Colombianjames Rodriguez, after this moment lit up the World Cup. Those head-spinning figures could not be further from the wages Stephanie commands, but thisjourney has never been about the money. At the end of the day, if I can say in ten years’ time that I have this, I will have that along with any money. The awards season is underway, and this football’s Oscars, but this red carpetis this football’s Oscars, but this red carpet is not a well trodden path for women. carpet is not a well trodden path forwomen. If for women. If Stephanie Roche does winter night, she will be blazing a trail for female footballers all over the world. Natalie Pirks, trail for female footballers all overthe world.

If you are screaming at the television, stop, I want to get off, I’m afraid there is little sign of any letup this week. Another deep area of low pressure continues to track north of the country. We have seen gusts in excess of 80 miles an hour in the far north again today, and some rain across England and Wales this afternoon. So it stays wet and windy. The rain has been light and patchy to start off with, but it will pepper up later. A rash of showers in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with hail and thunder. There is a real North-South divide in the feel of the weather. Double figures with the cloud and rain to the south. A cold afternoon in the north. That cloud and rain will continue to sink South and East overnight, maybe packing up across Essex and Kent. Maybe some surface water issues first thing in the morning. Behind it, colderand Kira, with wintry showers continuing. There may be icy stretches first thing in the morning across Scotland and Northern Ireland. We start off cloudy and damp. Frequent wintry showers continue through Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland. A raw feeling day when you add on the strength of the wins in the far north. There are showers in Wales and the south-west. They will continue to push south and east, really introducing the cold air by the end of Tuesday. So even across England and Wales, we could see snow at lower levels. Through the latter stages of Tuesday, more significantly make -- stages of Tuesday, more significantly make -- Kim elation as possible across Scotland and Northern Ireland. We could see so showers across the Pennines in south Wales, maybe as far south as the Cotswolds and the Chilterns for a time on Tuesday evening. We could wake up first thing on Wednesday morning to a picture like this, with a dusting of snow around, but it will not last. The next spell of stormy weather will arrive, wet and windy, which could cause yet further disruption. It will be windy start Wednesday. A cool one, with showers, but it will not be long before the next load moves into Northern Ireland, bringing yet more wet and windy weather with it. We could see significant snow for a time, but it will be transient. The rain pushes in, with a milderfeel. We will be transient. The rain pushes in, with a milder feel. We could see heavy rain and very strong winds again by the end of the week. So plenty to talk about with the weather. We are throwing everything but the kitchen sink in. Travel disruption is likely. That is all from us. Now we go to our news teams where you are. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC London lunchtime news with me, Asad Ahmad. The Archbishop of Canterbury says he’s powerless to stop a retired vicar from Surrey, jailed for child sex offences, continuing to call himself ""reverend"" or wear a clerical collar. Guy Bennett, who was a vicar in Oxted, wasjailed over 15 years ago after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting three girls. Colin Campbell reports. Photographed at a celebrity event in 2008, this is retired vicar Guy Bennett, continuing to wear a clerical collar after being convicted of child abuse. The disgraced Surrey priest, seen here in the 1980s, also still refers to himself as reverent. The Archbishop of Canterbury, justin Welby, says there is nothing he can do to stop it, upsetting the alleged victims. We are buttons to, baffled, angry, frustrated, and shocked, really -- bemused. Lucy Duckworth said she was sexually abused by Guy Bennett when she was a schoolgirl. Guy Bennett was not convicted of abusing her but went to jail for assaulting three other 11-year-old girls. After expressing her concern to the Archbishop of Canterbury, she received this letter in which justin Welby says, we cannot prevent them for using the title reverent or even from wearing a clerical collar. In fact, he says, everyone is able to wear such dress, as long as they do not do so for illegal purposes. He goes on to say, as it stands, Ido not have the powers to depose him from clerical orders, though I understand your sense of injustice about that. The Archbishop of Canterbury says Guy Bennett is not allowed to officiate, is not allowed to hold office, and is on a list distributed to bishops, is that not enough? He is the head of the church and is powerless to remove convicted child abusers from the institution? They need to let us know who has that power. Within the Anglican power, the process of ordination is considered irreversible, meaning a priest can continue to call himself reverent even after committing a serious crime. I would like it very much if it were within the power of the church to remove that, but that would require an act of Parliament, it is not something we have control overin it is not something we have control over in any way, at all. Guy Bennett was the vicar here at Saint Mary’s in Oxted, Surrey, said 26 years. He was convicted in 1999 after admitting he sexually abused three 11-year-old girls. He wasjailed for nine months then place on the sex offender’s register for ten years. Although he is banned from officiating in any churches, he guilty to attend a church somewhere in Sussex as a member of the congregation. The Archbishop of Canterbury says if they know which church the convicted priest attend, they can keep an eye on the individuals. All I have had from the church, after a 6 or seven year battle which is far from over, church, after a 6 or seven year battle which is farfrom over, is that I have been told he is safe, but they have not told me white or how he is said, and I know myself, as a teacher, if I had even been accused of anything near this nature I would be struck off the register, I would not be allowed to set foot on any school premises at all. Guy Bennett denies abusing Lucy Duckworth. He says he does not refer to himself as reverent but others do and he does not stop them as it is his title. He said he has not worn his dog on a fork -- his title. He said he has not worn his dog on a fork -- has not worn his clerical collar for over ten years. From this morning, tens of thousands of people are being affected by a change to rail services at London Bridge station which will last for 18 months.

Here’s out transport correspondent, Tom Edwards. Big changes for thousands of rail commuters this morning, as planned work at London Bridge now means many services won’t stop there, and a new timetable means busier trains than usual. I hadn’t realised it would be quite so overcrowded. It has been more overcrowded even since the start of the year. It’s crowded, haven’t got a seat, didn’t really expect too much else. We haven’t got a choice. If it does mean ultimately improved services in three years’ time, then that will be fine. At London Bridge, Network Rail said the closure went relatively well. There were extra buses, but there was still confusion. Did you know they were going to change the timetable? Oh, yeah, yeah. But it’s still been confusing? Oh, gosh, terrible. Absolutely dreadful. I am now late for work. I think there must be a better way of organising some of the station improvements. ",,

Eddie Redmayne. On BBC London: The Mayor’s criticised for planning to sell off fire stations for million of pounds below their market value. And the vicar convicted of child sex offences still calling himself Reverend - the Archbishop of Canterbury says he’s powerless to stop him. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. 10,000 troops will be on the streets of France by tomorrow evening in an effort to stop another terrorist attack after the deaths of 17 people in Paris last week. It is the first time troops have been deployed within France on such a scale. They’lljoin 5,000 police who are being sent to protect Frenchjewish sites and some mosques as detectives hunt for accomplices of the killers. CCTV footage has been released of the wife of one of the gunmen at passport control in Turkey as she made her way to Syria. From Paris, Lucy Williamson sent this report. This is how France is keeping its schoolchildren say. Soldiers patrolling outside Europe’s oldest jewish school and mingling with five-year-olds. 10,000 security forces are moving into place across the country today, half of them at jewish sites. The school director tells me the jewish community has faced threats in the past but never have soldiers had to sleep inside the school at night. It is surreal, he says. We need the Army because we have in front of us terrorists, it is not a joke. We are not in the picture, we are not in a film. Really, we are very, very anxious of the situation. I am the director of the school. I am not james the situation. I am the director of the school. I am notjames Bond. This is what hostages went through last Friday in the siege in a jewish supermarket in Paris. Hiding in cardboard boxes to survive. The French Interior Minister came to visit Paris’s mainjewish area today having ordered the country’s largest post-war deployment of security forces amid fears of future attacks. This is the kind of image France has when it comes to domestic security, tough and uncompromising. But the attackers were well known to authorities, as was the problem of French citizensjoining authorities, as was the problem of French citizens joining jihadist groups overseas, so how did this happen? That question became louder today with the appearance of this video from Istanbul airport. The woman in the white headscarf passing through immigration is thought to be Hayat Boumedienne, a key suspect in the supermarket attack. Turkish authorities say the man accompanying her was not on a watchlist and the two are now thought to in Syria. Hayat Boumedienne is thought to have travelled from Paris to Madrid before the attacks took place. She flew on to Istanbul and then took a domestic flight to the Syrian border. Four days later, she crossed into Syria and is now thought to be in Raqqa. Some say we need a real debate about why some people here are so angry and what it means to be French today. Here, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, and security chiefs have reviewed the risk of a Paris-style attack in the UK. The UK terror threat level remains unchanged at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. But Mr Cameron said if re-elected in May, he would want to give the security services more powers to monitor online and telephone conversations between terror suspects, as our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, explains. The moment French special forces stormed the printing plant where two gunmen were holed up. Newly released video shows the end of three days of terror. Gunfire, a manhunt and then two sieges. The question being asked today, can Britain stop such an attack and is it ready if one Takes Place? The Prime Minister said this morning, if he wins the election, there will be more powers aimed at detecting those planning terror. I will make sure it is a comprehensive piece of legislation that makes sure we do not allow terrorists say space to communicate with each other. That is the key principle, do we allow safe spaces for them to talk to each other? I say, safe spaces for them to talk to each other? Isay, no, we don’t safe spaces for them to talk to each other? I say, no, we don’t and we should legislate accordingly. The Prime Minister receives regular briefings from the head of MI5. Last week he raised concerns about a capability gap as suspects use new forms ofjune negations technology. Controversial proposals to preserve more data about our communications so that the state can request it and to ensure content of communications can be intercepted. Are these new powers the answer? French security officers dropped surveillance on the brothers behind the attack because they did not think they posed a risk. Some are concerned using the attack tojustify risk. Some are concerned using the attack to justify increased surveillance here. We have to always make sure we have limited individuals pin interference in the lives of individuals -- individuals pin interference in the lives of individuals -- limited interference in the lives of individuals. Intelligence, security and military chiefs met here this morning to brief the Prime Minister. They are aware of the political arguments, but their focus was all about what to do if an attack got through. For instance, how they would use the military, holding more training exercises and trying to stop potential attackers getting hold of guns. MI5 has warned it will not be able to stop every attack and working out how far to go to try to prevent one might still prove politically controversial. Within the last few minutes, it has been confirmed hackers have hacked into the US military Central command in the name of so-called Islamic State. Let us go to john Sobel the name of so-called Islamic State. Let us go tojohn Sobel in Washington. What can you tell us? It looks like US Central command which on a daily basis gives us the news about what attacks have taken place overnight in Syria or Iraq by US forces, their Twitter account has been hacked and it looked at the NEET like it was by Islamic State -- and it looked like it was by Islamic State. We are in your PCs. With Allah’s commission, we will not stop, we know everything about you -- commission. US soldiers, we are watching you. A number of tweets have been put out in the name of Islamic State on the Twitter account seeming to show the names of former officers and home a -- seeming to show the names of former officers and home a -- home addresses and the like. It does appear to be a major security breach. The NHS Cancer Drugs Fund, set up to pay for particularly expensive treatments that aren’t usually available to patients, is to be increased. But cancer groups have expressed concern that 25 drugs will be removed from the list and therefore no longer available. just this weekend, NHS England announced a five-year action plan to improve cancer survival rates and save thousands of lives. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, has more. julie is taking a drug for a highly aggressive form of breast cancer. The effect has been positive, reducing the spread of the disease. Whether it would be funded by the NHS for new patients was hanging in the balance until today. It has enabled me to carry on my life. I am a mum, to be able to play with my boys, to be a mum and a wife and have fun with my family and spend amazing quality time with them, that is what this drug has done for me. While the drug will continue being paid for by the Cancer Drugs Fund, NHS England has ruled 25 others have been dropped because they are too expensive. Three new ones have been added. The fund was set up by David Cameron in 2010 to pay for treatments not available on the NHS. The budget was raised to 280,000,020 14. There have been predictions of an overspend -- 14. There have been predictions of an overspend -- the budget was raised to £280 million in 2014. The current range of cancer drugs will have to be restricted. The fund has a fixed budget and we want to work within it and it is crucial that when you have a fixed budget like that, we apply the best drugs within it with the best possible outcome for patients. Ground-breaking for patients. Ground- breaking research for patients. Ground-breaking research on new medicines is continuing at labs like this one by the institute of cancer research. There is still the issue of who pays. The saga of the Cancer Drugs Fund raises a number of questions about the use of taxpayers money for expensive drugs and treatments to prolong the lives of patients and the difficult choices underlying that. It has been argued it was a short-term answer to a problem which has not gone away. This fund has taken money away from the NHS when it has been under particular pressure. The evidences the money spent on the Cancer Drugs Fund could have improved survival in many different diseases. Today brought good news for patients who might want to start taking the same drug asjulie. For others with want to start taking the same drug as julie. For others with different types of cancer, there will be disappointment. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories.

Steven Emerson made the remark while discussing the terror attacks in France on the Fox News Channel. Drivers in Indonesia are trying to free a black-box Drivers in Indonesia are trying to free a black- box voice free a black-box voice recorder stuck below the wreckage of the AirAsia plain that crashed last month. Another black box, which records the flight data, has been brought to the surface. Both will be analysed to see what caused the plane to crash. Our transport correspondent, Richard Westcott, has been to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in Farnborough where black boxes are examined. After a fingertip search in murky waters, the biggest clue yet as to why the AirAsia plane crashed. One of the two black boxes, painted orange as they are easier to find, brought safely ashore. The other has also been located but not yet recovered. Inside each of the large cylinders, this is what the investigators will be looking for, the circuit boards. One of them records everything the aircraft is doing technically, thousands of pieces of data. The other records the sounds on the flight deck, not just what the crew are saying to each other, are switches being flicked, alarms going off, engines straining? When you put that together, we get the full picture. British experts have been helping the Indonesian investigation. We have been given rare access to the room in the UK where they analyse black- box data. Magnetically sealed to stop eavesdropping. It is quite possible that they will look to replay the cockpit voice recorder initially before the flight data. The flight data takes several days to analyse to any great extent, but the voice recorder may provide almost instantaneous answers to some of the questions that the investigators may be asking. The AirAsia team is putting this recorder into fresh water to slow down any corrosion. It is a key find but families must still be patient. If the recorders are wet inside, it could be several days, perhaps as many as five days. The recorders, the circuit boards, need to be dried out, which can take between two to three days, and several days to analyse the audio and flight data afterwards. As divers try to free the second black box they believe is trapped under a wing, this crash has again led to calls for some black-box data to be sent live to engineers on the ground. It is expensive but could spare families the agonising wait for answers. Our top story: France deploys 10,000 troops on the streets to stop another terror attack. Extra police will another terror attack. Extra police will protect jewish schools and mosques.

Over 1,000 British farmers haven’t been paid for their milk today because of a financial crisis at a British dairy. First Milk, a farmer-owned cooperative, is asking its members to accept a delayed payment because of cash-flow problems caused by a global drop in milk prices. The National Farmers’ Union say some farmers are now receiving just 20p per litre for milk, the lowest price in eight years and cheaper than some bottled water. Every day, can number 32 produces around 28 litres of milk. The robot feed her, looks and even cleans up. Injune, she will do the same, but from then, nobody wants to buy her milk. jonathan’s contract with a Scottish cheese producer is being terminated, nobody wants to pick it up. Being a modern efficient producer has saved him from oversupply and the tumbling price. Prices are so low, milk is regularly cheaper than water. This cost me 63p a litre, this was £111. Although farmers would like to see supermarkets do more to push British dairy products, the real issue is thatit dairy products, the real issue is that it has been a great year across the world for growing this, grass. At the same time, the big local importers lost their first, China had too much milk, Russia banned European dairy in reaction to the turmoil in Ukraine. jonathan can only see one long-term cancer. The milk volume has to drop. The only way that will happen is if farmers go out of business. You have to hope that other farmers through in the towel before you? That is the way it looks, yes, a grim reality for the industry. Why was the NFU recently pushing dairy farmers to produce more? I would pushing dairy farmers to produce more? Iwould not more? I would not say the NFU advised farmers to increase production. You did, I have got a document, we want to encourage British dairy farmers to meet their great potential to produce more. Looking longer-term, we know the demand for milk will rise to feed 9 billion people. Until that global appetite for dairy products feeds through to our farmyards, it is likely to be a very lean time. A teenager who stabbed to death a 14-year-old boy he met while playing online video games has been sentenced to life in prison. Lewis Daynes, who is 19, had befriended Breck Bednar online, along with a number of other adolescents, before luring him to his death. The judge described it as a sexual and sadistic killing. Breck Bednar was passionate about gaming, but it brought him into contact with the boy who would kill him. Lewis Daynes groomed him, try to turn him against his family. He Hugh Orde him to his flat in Essex, where he murdered him. Breck Bednar had never met him before he travelled here by taxi. He said his father a text message to ask if he could stay overnight. In males showed how Lewis Daynes persuaded Breck Bednar to meet him. What happened after that is only known to Lewis Daynes, but police have released a recording of a 999 call. What has happened? My friend and I got into an altercation. I am the only one who came out alive. Have you killed somebody? Yes. Breck Bednar’s family had been concerned, his mother had called the police and temporarily took away his computers. Lewis Daynes continued to can indicate with her son. I phoned the police, alerting them of my concerns regarding the grooming, and I believed the police would help me. I had given them enough information to check their systems to see that Lewis Daynes was known to the police. The IPCC is investigating the response, and Essex Police’s handling of separate allegations against Lewis Daynes. It was Pakistan’s worst terror attack, when Taliban gunmen opened fire on a school killing 150 people, most of them children. Now, just a month later, the school is re-opening with a ceremony to remember the children and their teachers who lost their lives that day. Our correspondent, Shaimaa Khalil, has been to Peshawar to talk to parents and children about the return to class and joins us now. Undoubtedly, this will have been a traumatic day for some. Traumatic indeed. When those children made their way back to the Army public school, the memories of the horror they have witnessed, and the friends they have lost, must have come rushing back. They must have come with a defiant message, many peoples said, despite what happened, we are not afraid, they did not want the militants to win. There is a great deal of nervousness on the parents’ side, many of them are worried that an attack like this might happen again, and there are many unanswered questions about why this happened in the first place. What on anything, families want their children to move on. I spoke to a family that were just about to send their children back to school. They are getting ready to go back to school. It has been nearly a month since they lost some of their friends during a Taliban attack. These last few weeks have not been easy. Forthe These last few weeks have not been easy. For the last three weeks, we have been in trauma, we have faced many hurdles, more than I have seen in my life. Like many parents, he is worried about his children. Today, he will escort them to school. This is what his sons witnessed not long ago. A Taliban massacre which killed more than 130 children. This lady is a teacher at the public school. She lost her son in the attack. On the day when many pupils have come back to classes, she only has the memory of her 16-year-old boy. It is not easy for me to show you these things. Many boys will come, but I will not be able to see him again over there. It is not that simple for a mother. But he has left. Now the school has reopened, how do you feel about going back? Iwant reopened, how do you feel about going back? I want to go back. I want to teach the students. I am not reluctant, I am want to teach the students. I am not reluctant, Iam not scared. It want to teach the students. I am not reluctant, I am not scared. It has been a day of mixed emotions for this family. Did you see any of your friends? Yes, many of my friends who are alive. What was it like? Very good. This is a city still on edge. But for these children’s glides to move on, classes have to resume. The first day back at school for students and teachers after it was attacked by the Taliban. Now, it was watched byjust a handful of people at the time, but luckily, Stephanie Roche’s wonder goal was caught on camera. This effort for her team, Peamount United, could this evening beat goals by the likes of Manchester United’s Robin van Persie as Fifa’s Goal of the Year. It’s the first time a goal by a female footballer has made the final shortlist. There was a generous sprinkling of success for British acting talent at the Golden Globes in Hollywood last night. Eddie Redmayne won Best Actor in a Film Drama for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. But the big winner was the independently-financed film Boyhood, picking up three awards including Best Drama. The first of the big award shows and a lot of famous British faces cramming the red carpet. You can’t turn on the telly here without a Brit being on some TV show. I cannot believe it. I have never experienced anything like it. It is crazy. Are you guys ready to have some fun tonight? The Golden Globes is a relaxed affair with stars roped in to poke fun at North Korea after Sony’s hacking scandal. You love Korea. Three Brits were up for Best Actor - Benedict Cumberbatch, David Oyelowo and the winner was... Eddie Redmayne. The Theory Of Everything. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking won him one of the most coveted prizes of the evening. Getting to spend time with Stephen Hawking who despite all of the obstacles put in his way has lived passionately and fully and with great humour was one of the great honours of my life. Boyhood, the film made with the same actors over 12 years, won three Golden Globes - Best Drama, Best Supporting Actress and Best Director. It means so much to us that people have seen it and responded to it in a personal way. There is nothing that feels better than that, to feel like we have made the connection. George Clooney accepted a lifetime achievement award by paying tribute to yesterday’s marchers in Paris. They marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear. We won’t do it. So, je suis Charlie. Thank you. Freedom of expression and speech, a big theme here on the red carpet. Such a wonderful symbol. It is funny how people find the perfect symbol and the symbol of the pen, the pen is mightier than the sword. Representing free speech, free art. This is the first of the big red carpets to be rolled out across Hollywood this awards season for the annual fussing over films, posh frocks and questionable acceptance speeches. But for the talent coming down these carpets, it is a rocky and bumpy road ahead to the Oscars injust six weeks’ time. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nick Miller.

An icy start to Tuesday across the northern half of the UK. Tomorrow, the cold air is right across the UK. Some sunshine, but a cold breeze, drinking more showers.

Even to lower levels. Some might settle into the Chilterns. A win to restart on Wednesday, but then, another storm, late Wednesday into Thursday, wind and rain.

Tonight on BBC London News: As her son’s killer starts a life sentence, we talk to Breck Bednar’s mother about the campaign to make the internet a safer place for children. If he disagreed with you, he would start to get really angry and irritable. If you really got him mad, he would threaten you with some crazy stuff. Also tonight: The Mayor comes under fire over plans to sell off three fire stations for £30 million below their market value. If he’s giving away £30 million of public money to build a free school, then I think that just shows it up for what it was. And it was a total farce when they made the cuts in the first place. Even busier trains for commuters using Southeastern services, with some services not stopping at London bridge for the next 18 months. Plus a day of disruption for bus passengers tomorrow - I’ll have details of a strike which threatens to affect the majority of services. Anything you are interested in goes into art. And an old master- why America’s greatest living documentary maker is focusing on the National Gallery. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. It’s been revealed that the killer of a Surrey schoolboy was arrested by Essex Police three years before the murder- but released when the force decided not to take further action. 19-year-old Lewis Daynes stabbed Breck Bednar at his flat in Grays after grooming him via internet gaming sites. He’d previously been accused of sexually assaulting another teenager. And BBC London has spoken to a 16-year-old American boy who witnessed Daynes targeting one of his own friends online. Katharine Carpenter has this special report. At this bar in Dalston, gamers might look like they’re playing alone. Hey, how’s it going, Alex? Hey, what’s up, man? Infact, they’re connected to millions of others, often chatting over a web-based system similar to Skype. Let’s get the game started. It was in this virtual world that Breck Bednar, a bright, friendly 14-year-old from Surrey, met his killer. Lewis Daynes was a manipulative fantasist whose lies about working for the CIA, living in New York and owning a multi-million pound business lured Breck to his death. Even though Breck was clever, in top sets, he wanted to believe what Daynes was saying. Daynes was promising him the world and promising him a career and promising him, you know, all that he wanted as an adult and, unfortunately, Breck believed it. Daynes ran the high-speed server which Breck and his school friends used to play war games. It meant he could talk to them, message them and it gave him control. If anyone disagreed with him, he’d expel them from the group - and it wasn’t the first time he’d tried to dominate others online. At first, he was a very nice guy. If he wanted something from you, he really knew how to, like, act nice and put on a good face and talk straight to your face. He was very convincing. This is Paul, a 16-year-old speaking to us from his room in Pittsburgh in the USA. He met Daynes online in 2010 and claims he tried to groom a mutual friend, a boy he called john. He really talked with him a lot. Like, a lot. And, so, he eventually... john became good friends with Lewis and john... So much so thatjohn tried to convince his parents that Lewis should come and live with them in Tennessee. And that threw off red flags to me because, I mean, john was only, I think, 13 at the time and Lewis was a lot older, like three years older than him. It could even have been me but fortunately, it wasn’t. One of Daynes’ friends from Essex told me he wasjust as unpredictable at school, reacting violently to the slightest provocation. He even tried to manipulate the police when he made this chilling 999 call after he’d murdered Breck. Essex Police emergency. Hi, there. OK. Hello. Er, I need police and a forensics team to my address, please. What do you mean? What’s happened? A friend and I got into an altercation and I’m the only one who came out alive. Lewis Daynes was exceptionally controlling to his family, to the gaming community, and he tried to be controlling towards the police. He would only give us the information he wanted to impart OI’! US. When we started to challenge him on that information, then he would totally shut down. Daynes had had previous contact with Essex Police. He’d been accused of sexually assaulting another boy. ",,

Security footage appears to show the wife of one of the Paris gunmen going through passport control on her way to Syria. The staff on the French magazine that was attacked, Charlie Hebdo, prepare this week’s edition. It will feature cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. The Government reviews security in the light of events in Paris but the threat level remains unchanged. Also, tonight: The Twitter account of the US Military’s nerve centre, Central Command, is hacked by people claiming to be from Islamic State. A teenager who stabbed to death a schoolboy he befriended online is sentenced to life in prison. A return to lessons for the children at the school in Pakistan where 132 of their classmates were murdered by the Taliban. Golden Globes. Later on BBC London: The mother of a murdered schoolboy, groomed online, has called for parents to be more aware of the dangers of the internet. And disruption for commuters as London braces itself for tomorrow’s bus strike. Good evening. In the largest ever deployment on French soil, 10,000 troops will be on the streets of France by tomorrow night to try to stop another terrorist attack after the deaths of 17 people in Paris last week. They’lljoin 5,000 police, who are being sent to protectjewish sites and some mosques. Meanwhile, staff on the magazine whose office was attacked, Charlie Hebdo, are preparing a new edition which will feature cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Three million copies are being printed instead of the usual 60,000. Here’s our Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt. This report contains some flash photography. France, a country changed by three days of terrorism. 10,000 troops deployed on the streets. Solders riding an escalator in a shopping centre. TRANSLATION: This morning we had 900 soldiers deployed around schools in the city of Paris. Many of the soldiers were guarding 700 jewish schools. Children arrived for the school day with troops at the gates. The Government said it was employing the military as it had never done before. We need the Army because we have in front of us terrorists. We have terror. It is not a joke. New information emerged about the suspect Hayat Boumedienne - the widow of Amedy Coulibaly, one of the three gunmen. She was shown in a white headscarf on CCTV arriving at Istanbul airport, having flown via Madrid. Her phone signal suggests she has now crossed into Syrian territory, in an area controlled by the Islamic State. Turkey said they had received no request to detain her. There was no notice from France stating she was dangerous and should be banned from entering the country. Therefore, there is not a specific entry ban on this person. In Paris, the Israeli Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, visited the jewish supermarket where four hostages were killed. His invitation to French jews to migrate to Israel has caused some irritation in France, where Government officials have pledged to defend the jewish community. At the office of the paper Liberation, they are preparing the next edition of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Having lost eight of their colleagues in last week’s attack. There are mixed emotions said this man, the direct. There is tension because of the deadline to publish and then there’s distress because they are overwhelmed by what they experienced. There’ll be cartoons of those who were killed. According to the magazine’s lawyer there will be drawings depicting the Prophet Mohammed. The magazine said on Wednesday it will have a print run of over one million. One newspaper stand we contacted said instead of just ordering two copies, with I they do normally, they will order 1,000. The appearance of new cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed will cause concern among some people. Tonight, the bodies of the four jewish victims were taken to Israel for burial tomorrow, on a day when the French Government will discuss new security measures. In a moment, we’ll talk to Gordon Corera, who’s on Downing Street, but first to Gavin Hewitt in Paris. News isjust in atrib bitted to one source, but about this front cover of Charlie Hebdo. Yes. It is, in the last few minutes one agency has got what it said will be the front cover of Charlie Hebdo, published on Wednesday. It appears to depict the Prophet Mohammed on the front cover with tears on his face, with a sign saying je suis Charlie. Under a caption which reads, ""all is forgiven."" It is likely to be controversial. There may be other drawings inside. As the magazine said today it will increase the print run to three million. It is bound to be regarded here as both defiant, but also very sensitive. One other bit of news which came out tonight, it is being said from police sources that they are looking for six other members of the terror cell. One man in particular interests them. He is said to have been seen driving a car, registered in the name of Hayat Boumedienne, the woman who is now said to be in Syria. And again, police are stressing that the threat is very present. The manhunt urgent. In the light of events in France, the Prime Minister has been reviewing security here and how prepared we are should something similar happen in the UK. That is right. Security, intelligence and military chiefs came here to Downing Street this morning to look at precisely that issue. For instance, are the military trained and red eye, including the Special Forces, to -- eye, including the Special Forces, to -- ready, including the Special Forces, to deal with the manhunt, the kind of shoot-out on the streets of Britain that was seen in France in the last few days? Also efforts to make sure that everything is being done to stop the smuggling of weapons that could be used in any attack. All of that is relatively uncontroversial. More controversial, later uncontroversial. More controversial, later in the morning, in a speech, the Prime Minister raised the issue of new powers for the intelligence agencies, particularly on the issue of communications data and the interception of communications. This goes back to the Communications Data Bill of a few years ago - goes back to the Communications Data Bill of a few years ago - what critics called the snooper’s charter. Fiercely opposed be I the Liberal Democrats. The reason why the Prime Minister said -- Liberal Democrats. The reason why the Prime Minister said -- tersely opposed by the Liberal Democrats. The reason why the Prime Minister said it. All of this a way in which Paris has heightened concerns here about security and pushed security back on to the political agenda. Hackers claiming to be from so-called Islamic State have seized control of the US Central Command Twitter account. Centcom, as it’s known, is the nerve centre of the US military operation. The site was filled with threats to American soldiers and some postings appeared to list names, phone numbers and some material classed for official use only. The cyber attack happened as President Obama gave a speech on cyber security. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, is in Washington. The Pentagon is playing this down as merely embarrassing rather than a real security threat, is it? This report contains some flashing images. Fora brief This report contains some flashing images. For a brief period when you went on Central Command’s YouTube site, this is what you found, a propaganda video showing they had hacked the ministry. What was more sinister is what was posted on the Twitter account. This appear pos be names of officers, suggesting they had got into the system servers T White House though was playing that down. I can tell you, this is something we are obviously looking into and something we take seriously. However, a note of caution as they are covering this story, there is a significant difference between what is a large data breach and the hacking of a Twitter account. And with less than perfect timing before the hack had come to light, Barack Obama was speaking about the importance of cybersecurity and the need to be vigilant. This week, I am laying out some proposals on how to seize the possibilities of an information age, while protecting the prosperity and values that we all cherish. Barack Obama had always warned the battle against Islamic State would be long and protracted and fought on many fronts. What he probably had not envisaged was that Centcom’s own Twitter and Facebook accounts would be victims of that battle. This is the more normal fare of the YouTube account and social media is a vital tool. As this counter-terrorism official told me, there are serious concerns. We have to come up with a better way of participating in social media because the Government want to get their story out. We need to come up with a better way to protect it and ensure it is not vulnerable to this vandalism F we cannot do that, then that will be a big problem. Centcom’s Twitter account is still down. That represents a propaganda victory for whatever was behind this hack. And the Pentagon are downplaying this as embarrassing rather than a security threat. Which is it? Think Ito get the masked head of Islamic State across the Twitter and YouTube account is propaganda victory. They have not managed to get the Crown jewels of US national security. Much of the information it transpires they put on the website was freely available on the internet. That will be a relieve to Centcom. Is it a wake-up call? Alarming? Absolutely. Will it lead to a review of cybersecurity? Almost certainly. Thank you. The NHS Cancer Drugs Fund, set up to pay for particularly expensive medicines that aren’t usually available to patients, is to be increased. But cancer groups have expressed concern that 25 treatments will be removed from the list and therefore no longer available. just this weekend, NHS England announced a five-year action plan to improve cancer survival rates and save thousands of lives. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, has more. julie is taking a drug for a highly-aggressive form of breast cancer. It is dramatically improved her quality of life, but it is not cheap. The NHS has been reviewing whether it should be available to new patients. It has enabled many eto carry on my life. I am a mum to mY eto carry on my life. I am a mum to my two boys. To be able to play with them. To be able to just be a my two boys. To be able to play with them. To be able tojust be a mum and a wife and have fun with my family and spend amazing, quality time with them. That is what this drug has done for me. This drug will still be paid for by the Cancer Drugs Fund, but some other breast cancer treatments are to be dropped. The fund was set up by David Cameron in 2010 to pay for treatments not available on the NHS. It had a budget of £200 million a year. That was raised to £280 million in 2014 because of increasing demand. This year, it will go up again to £340 million. Amidst fears of a large overspend, restrictions will be introduced. 25 treatments will no longer be funded. Three new ones will be added. NHS England say some are too expensive, others have limited value. One company whose drug was dropped denied it was overcharging. It is priced at the same level today as new drugs for breast cancer were priced 15 years ago. We don’t believe we have overpriced this drug and it is an expensive cancer drug. There’s ground-breaking research on new medicines at labs like, this funded by Breakthrough Breast Cancer and others. If they are cleared for use by patients the NHS must decide how much it is reasonable to pay. The saga of the Cancer Drugs Fund raises questions about the use of taxpayers’ money for expensive drugs and treatments to prolong patients’ lives and the difficult choices underlying that. It has been argued it was a short-term answer to a problem which has not gone away. This fund has taken money away from the NHS, while being under pressure. The evidence we have from recent research is the money spent on the Cancer Drugs Fund could have improved survival in many different diseases. Today brought good news for patients who might want to start to take the same drug forjulie. For others, with different types of cancer, there’ll be disappointment. A teenager, who stabbed to death a 14-year-old boy he met while playing online video games, has been sentenced to life in prison. Lewis Daynes, who is 19, had befriended Breck Bednar online, along with a number of other adolescents, before luring him to his death. The judge described him as sadistic and manipulative. Daniel Boettcher reports. Breck Bednar described by his family as Intel gent, thoughtful, independent. He was passionate about gaming and socialising online with friends, but also in a virtual community which brought him into contact with the person who would kill him. Lewis Daynes became more and more controlling. He lured Breck to his flat. In a 999 recording to police he claimed it happened during a struggle. What’s happened? My friend and I got into an altercation and I’m the only one who came out alive. Are you telling me you’ve killed somebody? Yes, I am. alive. Are you telling me you’ve killed somebody? Yes, Iam. Breck Bednar had never met Daynes before he travelled here by taxi. He told his father he was going to Soay friend and -- his father he was going to Soay friend and -- to see a friend. He asked to stay overnight. E-mails showed how Daynes persuaded Breck to meet him. His fabbingily didn’t know he was meeting Daynes. They had become worried about their son’s contact with him. His brother had called the police with her concerns. Without her knowledge Daynes continued to communicate with him. Something major must be done to make improvements to online safety. The internet is such a vast opportunity for educationing and enjoyment but we must keep it safe for children as there is also a very real danger. The IPCC is investigating the response by Surrey Police to his mother’s phone call and also into how Essex Police handled a separate allegation against Daynes. A senior commander in the Afghan Army has told the BBC that fighters from Islamic State are establishing a presence in Afghanistan for the first time. General Mahmoud Khan said IS extremists are recruiting in Helmand Province, where British troops were deployed before their withdrawal last October. From Camp Shorabak, in Helmand Province, David Loyn reports. Afg ha n forces Afghan forces are on high alert in their headquarters. There have already been several Taliban attack since British and American forces left the base, then called Camp Bastion, last month. But now the Afghan troops may be training to fight a new enemy, a former Taliban commander here has changed sides. TRANSLATION: Five days ago, people came and told me that he had been recruiting for Islamic State. The huge area that was once the British part of the base here is now deserted. The apparent emergence of so-called Islamic State here in Helmand within weeks of British troops leaving, is a disturbing sign of how much there was still to do when they left. Tribal elders were called in for an Afghan military parade, a show of strength. They told of gun battles between the Taliban and the new group, leaving many dead. One said that the new group were flying Islamic State black flags and they took down Taliban flags. Separately, a video has been posted online of Pakistani Taliban fighters across the border, pledging allegeance to Islamic State. Two of them are from Afghanistan, showing a potentially highly dangerous link across this unstable frontier. This is a large, conventional army trained by Western forces including Britain and America. just such an army crumbled in Iraq in the face of the so-called Islamic State. Now, there is the first concrete evidence that Islamic State fighters have set up here in Helmand. The coffin of an Afghan soldiers, fallen in the fight, was loaded onto the plane that brought us back to Kabul. The fight hasjust become far bigger. Pauline Cafferkey, the nurse from Glasgow who’s being treated for Ebola, is showing signs of improvement. A statement from the London Hospital, where she’s being treated, said the 39-year-old is no longer critically ill. More than a thousand British farmers haven’t been paid for their milk today because of a financial crisis at a British dairy. First Milk, a farmer-owned cooperative, is asking its members to accept a delayed payment because of cash-flow problems caused by a global drop in milk prices. The National Farmers’ Union say some farmers are now receiving just 20p per litre for milk, the lowest price in eight years and cheaper than some bottled water. Tom Heap reports. Every day cow number 32 produces around 28 litres of milk. The robot feeds her, milks her, and even cleans up. Come june, she will do the same, but from then, nobody wants to buy her milk. Go on. jonathan’s contract with a Scottish cheese producer is being terminated. No-one else wants to pick it up. Being a modern, efficient producer, who has invested heavily in robotics, hasn’t saved him from oversupply and the tumbling milk price. Prices are so low that now milk is regularly cheaper than water. This will cost me 63p a litre, this £1.11. Although farmers would like to see supermarkets do more to push British dairy products, the real issue here is that it’s been a great year across the world for growing this, grass. At the same time, the big global importers lost their first, China had too much milk in store and Russia banned European dairy products in reaction to the turmoil in Ukraine. jonathan can only see one, long-term answer. Simply the milk volume has to drop. The only way that’s going to happen is if farmers go out of business. Is the unfortunate fact that you have to hope that other dairy farmers throw in the towel before you? That is just about the way it looks, yes. That’s a very grim reality for the farming industry. A shrinking number of dairy farmers is already a reality. 20,000 in England and Wales 13 years ago, less than half of that today. But the total volume of milk has gone up, as farms grow and cows yield more per head. So why, last year, was the National Farmers’ Union advising members to produce more? I wouldn’t say the NFU advised their farmers to increase production. You did encourage people to produce more. I have a document here which says we encourage British dairy farmers to meet their great potential to produce more. Looking long-term we all know the demand for milk and milk products will rise to feed this nine billion people. Until that global appetite for dairy products feeds through to ourfarm yards, it’s likely to be a very lean time. It was Pakistan’s worst terror attack, when Taliban gunmen opened fire on a school killing 150 people, most of them children. Nowjust a month later, the school is re-opening with a ceremony to remember the children and their teachers who lost their lives that day. Our correspondent, Shaimaa Khalil, has been to Peshawar to talk to parents and children about their return to the classroom. They’re getting ready to go back to school. It’s been nearly a month since they lost some of their friends during the Taliban attack. These last few weeks haven’t been easy. For the last three weeks, we are in big drama. We face many hurdles than ever I’ve seen in my life. Like many parents here, he’s worried about his children. Today he’ll escort them to school. And this is what his sons witnessed not long ago, a Taliban massacre, which killed more than 130 children. This is a teacher at the army public school. She lost her son in the attack. On the day when many pupils have come back to classes, she only has the memory of her 16-year-old boy. It’s not easy for me to show you all these things. Many boys will come, will sit there, but I’ll not be able to see my son again over there. It’s not that simple for a mother to tolerate. But he has left. Now the school has re-opened, how do you feel about going back? I want to go back. I want to teach the students. I’m not reluctant. I’m not scared. It’s been a day of mixed emotions for this family. Did you see any of your friends? Yes, I saw many of my friends, who are alive. And what was it like seeing them? I was feeling very good. This is a city still on edge, but for these children’s lives to ITIOVE OI’I, classes i’I8Vâ to FESUITIE. Shaimaa Khalil with the story of a difficult day back at school for students and teachers after the attacks by the Taliban. In football, FIFA has crowned Cristiano Ronaldo the world’s best player of the year at a ceremony in Zurich. The goal of 2014 was won by the Colombianjames Rodriguez. His finish against Uruguay in the World Cup came top in the public vote for the prestigious Puskas award. He beat Stephanie Roche from Ireland, who came second with 33% of the vote. Her goal for little known Peamont United against Wexford Youths put her in the running to be the first woman ever to win the title. There was a generous sprinkling of success for British acting talent at the Golden Globes in Hollywood last night. Eddie Redmayne won Best Actor in a Film Drama for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. But the big winner was the independently financed film ""Boyhood"" picking up three awards, including Best Drama. The ceremony was marked by many in the acting community expressing their support for France in the wake of last week’s terror attacks. Alistair Leithead reports from the red carpet. The first of the big award shows, and a lot of famous British faces cramming the red carpet. You can’t turn on the telly here without some Brit being in some TV show. I can’t believe it, I’ve never experienced anything like. It’s just crazy. Are you guys ready to have some fun tonight? The Globe is a relaxed affair, with stars roped in to poke fun at North Korea, after Sony’s hacking scandal. Three Brits were up for Best Actor, Benedict Cumberbatch, David Oyelowo and the winner was... Eddie Redmayne. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking won him one of the most coveted prizes of the evening. Getting to spend time with Stephen Hawking, who, despite all the obstacles put in his way, has lived passionately and fully and with great humour, was one of the great honours of my life. Boyhood, a film made with the same actors over 12 years, won three Globes for Best Drama, Best Supporting Actress and Best Director. It means so much that people have seen it and responded to it in a personal way. There’s nothing more that’s better than that. I feel like we made that connection. George Clooney accepted a Lifetime Achievement Award by paying tribute to yesterday’s marchers in Paris. They marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear. We won’t do it. So, je Suis Charlie. Freedom of expression and speech, a big theme here on the red carpet. It’s such a wonderful symbol, you know, it’s funny how people find the perfect symbol. The symbol of the pen, the pen is mightier than the sword representing free speech, free art. The Golden Globes are just the start of the annual award season here in Hollywood. The Oscars are still six weeks away, but they are a good indication that this year there’s strong British talent with high hopes of an Academy Award. That’s all from us. On BBC Two Newsnight reports on the journey of the Paris killers from a suburban park to last week’s attacks. Now now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. It was in this virtual world that Breck Bednar, a bright, friendly 14-year-old from Surrey met his killer. Lewis Daynes was a manipulative fantasist whose lies about working for the CIA, living in New York and owning a multi-million pound business lured Breck to his death. Even though Breck was clever, in top sets, he wanted to believe what Daynes was saying, and Daynes was promising him the world, and promising him a career and promising him, you know, all that he wanted as an adult. Unfortunately, Breck believed it. Daynes ran the high-speed server which Breck and his school friends used to play war games. It meant he could talk to them, message them and it gave him control. ",,

We couldn’t wait a moment longer, could we? 50 years ago, Winston Churchill was laid to rest. No-one who saw it has ever forgotten the farewell the nation gave him. We were all undone by the cranes dipping in salute. It was so grand, but so personal. The Government says it will re-double its efforts to wipe out anti-semitism in the UK. At a service to commemorate victims of the Paris terror attacks, the Home Secretary said some in the jewish community here were now fearful. I never thought I would see the day when members of thejewish community in the United Kingdom would say they were fearful of remaining here in the United Kingdom. Some of those from the Yazidi religious community freed by Islamic State in Iraq have been speaking about the horror of captivity. And a record 6 million people turn out to see the Pope, on the final, rain-soaked day of his visit to the Philippines. Good evening. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has sought to reassure Britain’sjewish population that all is being done to protect them in the wake of the recent terror attacks in Paris. She said the Government will redouble its efforts to wipe out anti-Semitism in the UK. Here’s Matthew Price. Britain’s jewish leaders remember the Britain’sjewish leaders remember the victims of Paris today, and then, taking the slogan of support from the ~ - - slogan of -- slogan of support from the streets of France, they held their own slogan aloft, I am jewish. ~ I never thought I would see the day when members of thejewish community in the United Kingdom would say that they were fearful of remaining here in the United Kingdom. This from a street CCTV camera... Someone sprayed the word liars across a Holocaust poster. Minor, yes, in comparison to Paris, but here, because of the concerns raised after those attacks, security is being increased at jewish schools and synagogues. In one north London jewish suburb this afternoon, some were too afraid to speak on camera. But this man said many are worried. I don’t think there is any... There hasn’t been any incidents to substantiate people’s fears, there is just an underlying fear among jews that we are not safe in the UK. Ultimately no government can guarantee the safety of all of its citizens however much security is put out on the street, the attacks in Paris made that very clear indeed. They also exposed the divisions that already exist within our communities, divisions which some fear could yet deepen. It is very important that there is a focus in the jewish very important that there is a focus in thejewish community, because historically they have been discriminated and persecuted. But also we should learn from the lessons of history and use that to protect the rights of other minorities who are facing similar discrimination. This is an important moment. Across Europe, governments are grappling with the same questions. How to combat extremism, and how to keep their streets and their people safe. Matthew Price is with me now. Is there a sense in government that cultural cohesion in the UK is under strain as never before? When I have asked government ministers and advisers that question they say no, this country is multicultural and that is its great strength. The comments from Theresa May are interesting. She’s clearly concerned about some of the thick she is hearing. We’ve also had a letter from she is hearing. We’ve also had a letterfrom Communities letter from Communities Secretary Eric Pickles in which he appeals for Muslim leaders’s help notjust for combating extremism in their own community, but also their help in combating Islamophobia. The police and government services are doing everything they can to prevent an attack in this country. And others are trying to make sure that some of the divisions that already exist in society do not deepen. The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, says it’s ""most likely"" that the Liberal Democrats will be part of a coalition government with Labour or the Conservatives after the General Election. Mr Clegg said his party wouldn’t do as badly as many commentators were predicting, but he admitted he wouldn’t pretend he was going to become Prime Minister. Here’s our Political Correspondent, Ben Wright. As the vote gets close, all bets are off. The result could produce another government of two parties. Or more. A combination of this, perhaps. Orthis. And one party leader is confident he will be in the mix. It is most likely that the Liberal Democrats will be back in government with a coalition of labour or the Conservatives. We would add heart to a coalition with the Conservatives, and spine and backbone on the economy which clearly the Labour Party lacks. He has still got some plans Iraq space fans despite his party’s plunge in the polls. He said pundits predicting that the Lib Dems would lose half their seats would have to eat their words. The Conservatives and Labour both smothered speculation about a coalition. I’m not being slippery about this. The point is, you cannot both be at one time thinking about doing a whole load of backroom deals, and also at the same time trying to put forward what you think is right for the country to win the election. I believe the best people to govern Britain are the British people themselves. Nick Clegg said he would notjoin a Coalition themselves. Nick Clegg said he would not join a Coalition Government with Ukip, and cannot imagine working with the SNP. The Greens would support a government to protect their antinuclear pledge. We are looking to confidence and supply. We want to vote against Trident. The two big parties are fighting for an election win and a clear majority. But at the moment, the polls are predicting another hung parliament. Whoever is in charge behind that door after May may find themselves playing a role with smaller parties as well. Islamic State extremists in northern Iraq have freed around 200 members of the Yazidi religious community they’d been holding captive. Those released are elderly men, women and children, all abducted when IS forces captured the town of Sinjar near the Syrian border last August. The Yazidis fled to the mountains to escape the militants. But thousands were taken captive and many Yazidi women have been forced into sexual slavery. Our Middle East correspondent Yolande Knell has the details. They arrived tormented by their ordeal and bearing signs of abuse and neglect. This is the first time Islamic State fighters have set three such a large group of their captives from Iraqi’s Yazidi minority. Most are elderly and sick. Little children need urgent medical care. TRANSLATION: They are very bad people. They took children and they took the women. They did all the bad things to us. We have been humiliated by them. Back in August, hundreds and thousands -- humiliated by them. Back in August, hundreds and thousands -- of Yazidis were taken by Islamic State. When help finally arrived for those stranded on Mount Sinjar, they were desperate. But those left in the hands of the fighters endured a terrible fate. Last year I met a woman who was held captive with other women. woman who was held captive with otherwomen. She other women. She told me they were raped. They would make us take off our headscarves. She described a vicious sex trade, where young girls were treated as the spoils of war. She was one of few who managed to escape. It is thought that many Yazidis had become too great a burden for the militants. They were abandoned. Experts say that this is the sign of a softening approach. Isis have never carried out policies giving the impression that they are humanitarian or compassionate, often very humanitarian or compassionate, often very much the opposite, but they do like to control the narrative, to surprise and to shock. They are being reunited with relatives in northern Iraq. But the suffering edged on their faces is a reminder of how the horror continues for those left behind. Eurostar train services resumed today after yesterday’s fire in the Channel Tunnel meant 26 trains had to be cancelled. But there were still delays this morning at St Pancras when trains were cancelled because of a separate power supply problem. Six million people have celebrated Mass with Pope Francis, on the final day of his visit to the Philippines and the Vatican says that’s a record. Our Religious Affairs Correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, has sent this report from Manila. Nothing could dampen theirjoy and the anticipation. Despite the heavy rain, some camped out all night so they could see Pope Francis for themselves. The biggest crowd ever recorded for a papal mass, some 6 million people in all. Pope Francis spoke often hear of love and the importance of family, reaffirming catholic teaching against contraception, while reaching out to the poor. We need to see each child as a gift to the world. We need to protect. Forthose as a gift to the world. We need to protect. For those who could not reach the mass, queueing for hours in the rain to see the Pope passing by, emotions ran high. Such deepjoy that Such deep joy that I have, and so much hope. We are once again proud to be Filipinos. We are so blessed! To see him in the flesh. Wow. Despite the appalling weather for much of this trip, Filipinos across the country have turned out in enormous numbers to see the Pope saying Mass in Manila today. He has told people here to take care of the poor, look after the young, and protect the environment, messages that struck a chord in this mostly catholic country that still has many poor. Pope Francis’s visit has been seen as a boost to morale. In Asia, Catholics remain a tiny but vocal minority. Now time for all the sports. Good evening. Arsenal have beaten Manchester City 2-0 this afternoon to move to within one point of the top four places in the Premier League. The defeat is a blow to the city’s title defence. The north-west has been a cold and unforgiving place for Arsenal, too often caught out in blizzards of goals. This time they seem to have wrapped up tighter. They got a grip and enforced a trip. Nacho Monreal fouled semicolon penalty. Santi Cazorla stepped up and squeezed it in. Magister city finally found the urgency their title chase demands, but not the quality. Perhaps they were still focusing on finding it when a new, ruthless Arsenal struck again. Olivier Giroud timed his run to perfection and celebrated accordingly. Arsenal were notjust accordingly. Arsenal were not just concerned accordingly. Arsenal were notjust concerned with looking good this time. Along with the grace, there was graft. Santi Cazorla embodied it. If the gunners were out of breath, their opponents were out of ideas, and afternoon where they surrendered momentum in the race for the Premier League. Manuel Pellegrini might need another plan.

Now it is time for the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The London Ambulance Service, who twice diverted paramedics away from attending to a woman from Croydon who’d suffered an epileptic fit, is being blamed for her death. On Friday, Monica Lewis, who lives a mile away from her local hospital, had a seizure. Her partner dialled 999, but her call wasn’t given priority. Nick Beake reports. Monica Lewis’s family say their pain is even greater because they believe she could have been saved. The 57-year-old died following a severe epileptic fit three days ago. Her partner called 999 but it took more than one hour for an ambulance to arrive. I’mjust than one hour for an ambulance to arrive. I’m just disgusted, and appalled. We are meant to be grieving right now and we can’tjust greed ~ "" WE -- we can’t just -- we can’tjust grieve because we have been let down so badly. She was assessed as category three, not life-threatening. A paramedic was dispatched but diverted to a higher priority call. Minutes later, again a paramedic was diverted to a higher priority call. Eventually she was upgraded, but it took 23 minutes to get to her. By then she was in cardiac arrest and died shortly afterwards. The London Ambulance Service offered their sincerest condolences to Monica Lewis’s family and said they were very sorry they could not get an ambulance to her earlier. But figures show that response times here are the slowest in the country. My mum is gone now, and details about response times doesn’t really mean anything to me when I have lost someone I love. It needs to fill 400 staff vacancies. But for Monica Lewis’s family, they feel they have been badly let down by an emergency service which simply wasn’t good enough. More now on delays being faced by Eurostar passengers using London St Pancras station for a second day. After being suspended yesterday, services did resume this morning, but only for a few hours before there were further problems. The impact is being felt by thousands of passengers, many of whom are looking to get back in time for work tomorrow. Emilia Papadopolous reports. Following yesterday’s disruption and delays, today was meant to be a lot easier. But for the thousands of passengers trying to cross the Channel, chaos continued. After a power supply problem closed both tunnels for two hours this morning. There is a very strong sense of deja vu. Almost 24 hours on IM stuck in the same place I was yesterday. Eurotunnel, responsible for the running of the tunnel itself, said today’s delays were directly related to yesterday’s fire. Because they were only able to run trains through one tunnel and they had to run more slowly. But Eurostar said: ",,
81,BBC News 24,18-jan-2015,BBC Weekend News,22:00,20 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten, the Government vows to redouble its efforts to wipe out anti-Semitism. Remembering the victims of the Paris attacks. The Home Secretary seeks to reassure Britain’s jewish community. I never thought I would see the day that members of thejewish community here in the United Kingdom would say they were fearful of remaining here in the United Kingdom. Gambling on success. The Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg says his party will most likely form a coalition with the Conservatives or Labour. Freed by so-called Islamic State, nearly 200 Yazidis describe the horror of their captivity in Iraq. And millions turn out for the Pope, on the last day of his visit to the Philippines. Good evening. The Home Secretary Theresa May has sought to reassure members of Britain’s jewish community, that everything is being done to protect them against the threat of a terrorist attack. Speaking at a service to remember victims of the recent Paris shootings, she pledged more police patrols at synagogues and jewish schools. Mrs May said Britain must redouble its efforts to wipe out anti-Semitism, as our correspondent Matthew Price reports. Britain’s jewish leaders remembered the victims of Paris today. And then, taking the slogan of support from the streets of France, they held their own version aloft. ""I am jewish."" A statement of defiance, but also of fear. A fear that has alarmed the Home Secretary. I never thought I would see the day when members of thejewish community in the United Kingdom would say they are fearful of remaining here in the United Kingdom. This from a street CCTV camera is the kind of action helping to spread that fear, someone covered head to toe sprays the word ""liars"" across a Holocaust poster. Minor, yes, in comparison to Paris, but here, because of the wider concerns raised after those attacks, security is being increased at jewish schools and synagogues. In one north Londonjewish suburb this afternoon, some were too afraid to speak on camera. This man said many are worried. I don’t think there is... There have not been incidents to substantiate people’s fears, there is an underlying fear amongst jews we are not safe in the UK. Ultimately no government can guarantee the safety of all citizens, however much security is put on the street. The attacks in Paris made that clear. They also exposed the divisions that exist within our communities. Divisions which some fear could yet deepen. Today the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles sent a letter to British Muslim leaders asking them to promote a positive image of Islam, but also promising the support mosques need to deal with anti-Islamic attacks. That has been welcomed. It is very important there is a focus in thejewish community because historically they have been discriminated and persecuted. We should learn from history and use that to protect the rights of minorities who face similar discrimination. This is an important moment. Across Europe governments are grappling with the same questions, how to combat extremism, how to keep the streets, their people safe. Our security correspondent Gordon Corera is with me here. There has been an announcement on police safety today. Along with the jewish community, the other group about whom there are concerns about security of the police themselves and we got details about measures. Updating risk assessments, deciding how they deployed to certain situations and increasing support, including firearms officers and increasing protection at police buildings. No decision yet to automatically move to always having two officers rather than one in a vehicle or on patrol. Some signs on how the police are taking their security more seriously. We have more details about the political debate about how much power the police and security services should have to go after some of these threats. The former head of MI5, jonathan Evans today wrote in the Telegraph newspaper about current laws being out of date when it comes to collecting communications intelligence, to try to find out who might pose a threat. It was noticeable on the BBC today Nick Clegg said he had some concerns and while he would advocate new laws, he also said he would not back any system that required keeping everyone’s data for long periods. The Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, says it’s ""most likely"" the Liberal Democrats will be part of a coalition government with Labour or the Conservatives after the General Election. Mr Clegg said his party wouldn’t do as badly as many commentators were predicting, but he admitted he wouldn’t pretend he was going to become Prime Minister. Here’s our Political Correspondent, Ben Wright. As the vote gets close, all bets are off. The result could produce another government of two parties, or more. A combination of this perhaps. Or this. One party leader is confident he will be in the mix. I think it is most likely that the Liberal Democrats back in government would mean either a coalition with Labour or the Conservatives. We would add heart, as we have over the last five years, to a Conservative-led coalition, and sort of spine and backbone on the economy, which clearly the Labour Party lacks. He still has some fans, despite his party’s plunge in the polls, but he says pundits predicting that the Liberal Democrats would lose half their seats would have to eat their words and insisted his party would oppose any move to raise VAT after the election. The Conservatives and Labour both smothered speculation about a coalition. I am not being slippery about this. You cannot both be thinking at one time of doing a load of backroom deals and also at the same time trying to put forward what you think is right for the country to win the election. I believe the best people to govern Britain are the British people themselves. It is a no to Nigel from Nick. The Lib Dem leader said he won’t join a government with Ukip and can’t imagine working with the SNP. The Greens say they will not go into a formal coalition, but they would support a government to protect their anti-nuclear pledge. We’re not looking towards a coalition. We are looking towards confidence and supply. So that would mean is we could go vote by vote so we can vote against Trident. The two big parties are battling for a decisive election win and a clear majority, but at the moment polls point to another hung parliament. So whoever is in charge after May behind that door may find themselves relying on smaller parties playing a major role, and that puts pressure on all these leaders and others to spell out who they would work with and say what their conditions for a deal would be. Islamic State extremists in northern Iraq have freed around 200 members of the Yazidi religious community they’d been holding captive. Those released are elderly men, women and children, all abducted when IS forces captured the town of Sinjar near the Syrian border last August. The UN says around 50,000 Yazidis fled to the mountains, but hundreds were taken captive with many of the women being into forced into sexual slavery. Our Middle East correspondent Yolande Knell has the details. They arrived tormented by their ordeal, and bearing signs of abuse and neglect. This is the first time Islamic State fighters have set free such a large group of their captives from Iraq’s Yazidi minority. Most are elderly and sick, little children need urgent medical care. TRANSLATION: They are very bad people. They took children and they took the women. They did all the bad things to us. We have been humiliated by them. Back in August, hundreds of thousands of Yazidi were forced from their homes by Islamic State. Many became stranded on the barren slopes of Mount Sinjar. When help finally arrived, they were desperate. Those left in the hands of the fighters endured a terrible fate. Last year I met this woman who was held captive with other women. She told me some were raped. TRANSLATION: Every day or two, men would come in and make us take off our headscarves. She described a vicious sex trade where young girls were treated as the spoils of war. She was one ofjust a few who managed to escape. It is thought that the Yazidis who have just been freed had simply become too great a burden for the militants. They were left near the front line where they could reach Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Experts doubt this is a sign of a softening approach, particularly towards Yazidis, who are seen as pagans by Islamic State. Isis has never carried out policies that give the impression they are humanitarian or compassionate. Often it is very much the opposite, but they do like to control the narrative, to surprise, to shock. These unexpected arrivals have now seen doctors and are being reunited with relatives. But the suffering etched on their faces is a reminder of how the horror continues for those left behind. A woman who persuaded her son to return to Britain after fighting in Syria, is calling for more support for families trying to reintegrate former Islamist militants. She says she’s been left on her own to de-radicalise her son. The number of Britons who’ve fought in Syria and Iraq is thought to have reached six hundred. Our Special Correspondent Lucy Manning has the details. For Linda, the fighting in Syria, the issue of Britishjihadis, is all too close to home. Her son, one of hundreds of Britons who went to fight. Last summer she went to Turkey and helped him escape from Syria. He has now come home, but not she feels to any support. The government are aware he went. Everyone has been informed. Nobody has been forthcoming with any kind of of help or support. Returning fighters from Syria are a clear security concern. The foiled plot in Belgium involving those who came back to Europe. Around 600 Britons have gone out there and half have returned. How to reintegrate them is the issue. So that an attack on home soil is not the outcome. There is no point in us as a society denying the presence of these people coming back because they are coming back and ignoring the problem is not going to make it any better. I feel that these people are just left unattended, not helped, not supported. The potential to society could be devastating. The Home Office said those who return will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and we have seen some prosecuted. For those who aren’t, they could be monitored by the security service. Some have been referred to the government deradicalisation programme. Others given help by social services and mental health teams. But some could be judged to not need any further intervention. In my opinion every single person who comes back from Iraq and Syria now should be put through the programme so they do not fall into the patterns they fell into before. Linda says her son is no longer a threat. As a parent, she says she forgives him. British authorities cannot afford to forget what those returning have learned in Syria. Lucy Manning, BBC News. And there’s more on that story, on Inside Out from tomorrow evening on the BBC i-player. For viewers in London, it’s on BBC One at 7.30. Suspected Boko Haram Islamist militants in Nigeria, have attacked a village near the border with Cameroon. Reports say they’ve abducted dozens of people including women and children. More than 20 homes are believed to have been set on fire. German police have banned a demonstration by an anti-Islamist group in Dresden tomorrow, because of what they say is a concrete threat against one of the organisers. The weekly rally is organised by a group campaigning against what it calls the Islamisation of the West. Eurostar train services resumed today after yesterday’s fire in the Channel Tunnel. But there were still some delays at St Pancras, because of a power supply problem. One of world’s biggest brewers has been accused of demanding shocking payment terms from its UK suppliers. AB InBev which makes Budweiser, and Stella Artois pays its outstanding bills A months after some firms have delivered products or services.The Business Minister Matt Hancock says such practices are entirely unacceptable but AB Inbev says terms are mutually agreed with suppliers. Here’s joe Lynam. They are some of the best-known brands in the world. Stella Artois, Budweiser and Corona, and they are owned by AB InBev. It made big profits last year of almost £12 billion. But it stands accused of demanding intolerable payment terms from small UK suppliers. This company makes conveyor belt systems. It does it for the biggest drinks companies in the world, none take as long to pay their bills as AB InBev. It waits 120 days before settling. It make things difficult for probably hundreds of small companies who have potential to do business with a major international organisation like that. I think it is unfair. It makes day-to-day life extremely difficult. In response, AB InBev said payment terms set as part of commercial negotiations and established in mutual agreement, and that The government has established a prompt payment code that urges signatories to settle bills and a reasonable amount of time. The problem is it’s not obligatory, which means as long as you have large firms waiting up to four months to pay bills, small ones will struggle and some might go out of business. The minister responsible said changes on the way. Any large company has to publish the terms on which it pays so that we know who the good payers are, and who aren’t. That is coming in this year. It will take much longer than a year to change the relationship between big and small companies like Brewpack. In the meantime other small firms may struggle. The Pope has ended his week-long tour of Asia with an outdoor mass in front of a record crowd in Manila. Officials say six million people were there. Our Religious Affairs Correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, was among the crowds in the Philippine capital. Nothing could dampen theirjoy or their anticipation. Despite the heavy rain, some camped out all night to make sure of a place, so they could see Pope Francis for themselves. The biggest crowd ever recorded for a Papal Mass, some 6 million people in all. Pope Francis spoke often here of love and the importance of family, reaffirming Catholic teaching against contraception while reaching out to the poor. We need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed, cherished and protected. For those who could not reach the Mass, waiting for hours in the rain to see the Pope pass by, emotions ran high. Such deep joy that I have and so much hope for our country. We are once again proud to be Filipinos. We are so blessed to follow him. To see him in the flesh. Wow! Despite the appalling weather for much of this trip, Filipinos from across the country have turned out in enormous numbers to see the Pope say Mass in Manila today. He has told people here to take care of the poor, look after the young and protect the environment. Messages that have struck a chord in this mostly Catholic country, which still has many poor. On this visit Pope Francis prompted controversy in Europe with his comments about the limits of free speech. But here, his trip has been hailed as a boost to morale and time to rejoice in the region all too often struck by tragedy. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News. Now, the sport. Good evening. Today’s two Premier League matches have made the race for a top four finish even more intriguing. It’s time to pop out of the room if you’re waiting for Match of the Day 2 which follows soon on BBC One, except in Scotland where it’s Sportscene first. Manchester City’s hopes of retaining the Premier League title were dented when they lost 2-nil against Arsenal. Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud scored in each half. Arsenal are just one point off the top four places. While City remain five points behind League leaders Chelsea. Also, West Ham beat Hull City 3-nil. In the European Rugby Champions Cup a stand-out performance from jonathanjoseph for Bath helped Bath defeat A times champions Toulouse 35 points to 18.

Elsewhere Glasgow Warriors beat Montpellier 21 to 10 to keep them in the hunt for the quarter finals. Northampton beat Ospreys in Pool 5 to end the Welsh side’s chance of a quarter-final place and edge them closer to the last eight with a 20 points to 9 victory. George North with this decisive try. The South African batsman AB de Villiers has recorded the fastest ever One Day International century offjust 31 balls. He went on to smash his way to 149 from just 44 deliveries to help South Africa beat West Indies by 148 runs. Patrick Gearey reports. AB de Villiers came to the ground known as the bullring with brutality and mine did not followed might qualify as cruelty to bowlers. The West Indies were struggling to contain South Africa, before AB de Villiers began the demolition and the crowd would see all a much of the ball as the fielders. The catapult could be loaded even when not upright. He lost balance but not momentum, shooting his way to 50 in a record 16 deliveries. He was getting faster. On his way to a century, he batted ten sixes and eight fours. Ball number 31 ended in the same place as the previous 30 but this was significant, bringing UP but this was significant, bringing up the fastest ever international 100. He finished with 149 and the West Indies have a man who scored a faster 100 in domestic cricket, but Chris Gayle could not steal the day. Shaun Murphy has been crowned the 2015 Masters snooker champion after a convincing win over Neil Robertson. The Englishman beat the world number one by 10 frames to 2 to take the title for the first time plus a cheque for £200,000. It means Murphy becomes only the 10th player to complete a career triple crown of World, UK and Masters titles. Many thanks.

Also on Wednesday, the latest UK unemployment figures will be published. And on Thursday, the Government is expected to publish draft legislation on further devolution for Scotland. That’s it for tonight. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. But do stay with us on BBC1,it’s now time for the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The London Ambulance Service - who twice diverted paramedics away from attending to a woman from Croydon who’d suffered an epileptic fit - is being blamed for her death. On Friday, Monica Lewis - who lives a mile away from her local hospital- had a seizure, but her case wasn’t given priority. Nick Beake reports. Monica Lewis is family say their pain is even greater because they believe she could have been saved. The 57-year-old died after a severe epileptic fit. Her partner called my 99 but it took over an hour for an ambulance to arrive. I am disgusted. We want to be grieving and we cannot grieve because we are still in shock we have been let down so badly. The first emergency call was made after midnight. Monica Lewis was categorised as non-life-threatening. A paramedic was dispatched but redeployed to a priority call. Another team was dispatched but devoted to a higher priority. After another call, Monica Lewis was upgraded to a life-threatening emergency with an eight minute target for a crew to arrive, but it takes 23 minutes for the ambulance to get to her and by then she is in cardiac arrest and died shortly afterwards. The ambulance service today offered their sincere condolences to the family and said they were sorry they could not send an ambulance earlier. Latest figures show response times in the capital to the most serious calls, which are life-threatening, but the slowest in the country. My mother has gone. Their categories and budgets does not mean anything to someone once you have lost someone you love. The London ambulance service is trying to cope with a 12% increase in calls. And it needs to fill 400 staff vacancies. The family of Monica Lewis, they feel badly let down by an emergency service that was not good enough. Eurostar says it plans to run a normal timetable tomorrow, after passengers suffered a weekend of delays and cancellations. The Channel Tunnel was closed for most of yesterday because of a lorry fire - and was shut again for some of today - after an electrical fault was detected. Emilia Papadopolous reports. Following yesterday’s disruption, today was meant to be easier. But, for the thousands of passengers trying to cross the Channel, chaos continued after a power supply problem close the tunnels the two hours. This professor spent the morning stuck on the train trying to get back to London. It was almost 24 hours after and I was stuck in the same places yesterday. We were told it was a technical issue. Eurotunnel who run the tunnel itself said the delays were directly related to the fire yesterday and because they were only able to run trains through one tunnel and they have two run more ",,

The American climbers nearing the top of a cliff face that’s Later on BBC London. We speak to the London bookshop owner who says its important to show solidarity with France by selling the magazine, Charlie Hebdo. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. David Cameron and Ed Miliband have each accused the other of cowardice over the General Election TV debates in a turbulent Prime Minister’s Questions. It came after the Labour leader, along with the leaders of the Lib Dems and UKIP wrote to David Cameron saying it would be ""unacceptable"" for him to refuse to take part. The Prime Minister says he will only debate if the Green Party is also included - and Mr Cameron today accused Ed Miliband of being ""chicken"" for not wanting them to take part. Here’s our Political Correspondent Chris Mason. They’re not watching for all or at a concert, they’re sitting on skateboards or the pavement and watching politics. This was in 2010 when 22 million of us caught at of one of the three debates held before the last election. David Cameron said he will not do it again with Ukip involved this time unless the Green Party is as well. In identical letters sent to the Prime Minister this morning, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage wrote, it would be unacceptable if the political self-interest of one party leader whereto denied the public the opportunity to see their leaders debate. If you allow politicians to go about framing the Democratic debate to their advantage, we lose our democracy. At heart this is about an independent body underdog taking a decision about how to do this and one politician holding the country to ransom. At Prime Ministers questions Ed Miliband picked up the theme. It is not for him or for me or for any party leader to decide who is in the debate, it is up to the broadcasters. That is the country we live in. Is he really telling the people of Britain that he is going to seek to deny them the TV debate if he does not get to choose who is in them! We had European elections this year and in them! We had European elections this yearand Ukip this year and Ukip and the Green Party both beat the Liberal Democrats I’m afraid to say. It is very simple. You either have both of them or you have none of them. Let me ask him again why is he so chicken when it comes to the Greens? No Nigel Farage in the Commons, the Ukip leader is not an MP, at least yet. He is 500 miles away from Westminster in his usual seatin away from Westminster in his usual seat in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. And there is a pattern. Guess how he is describing the Prime Minister? Chicken. He is running scared. It is interesting than when the Conservatives this week launched their week six topics for the general election campaign, immigration was not amongst them. That I think is why he would rather take the hit for stopping these debates than allow them to go ahead. As for the Green Party, they are still hopeful they might be included in one of the debates. There are calling for Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip to welcome them. The alternative solution is that these three parties should say that the Green Party should be there and then broadcasters would agree. But what about the Scottish National Party? Its popularity has soared since the independence referendum and it has twice as many MPs as Ukip and the Greens put together. It can only happen if they are based on clear democratic principles and to exclude the largest party in Scotland and the third largest in the UK from these debates would not pass the most basic of democratic tests. And do not forget us to, say the Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. The TV companies meanwhile say they do want these debates again and they are working to make them happen. But plenty are now wondering whether they actually will. Well Norman Smith is in Westminster. Are these debates going to go ahead? Well conventional wisdom has always been that debates happened at the last election so they will happen at this one. My sense is that is now open to question. just talking to one person in Downing Street the other day, he said to me, there are not yet dead parrot but I got the sense he would not be too perturbed if this but it your bird dropped off its perch. The recent that the debates may not take place is because of that other big Bird, the chicken. The charge against Mr Cameron that he is unwilling to take part in the debates because he is frightened that he has the most to lose. But Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are facing their own chicken charge that they do not want the Greens involved a cause they fear they have the most to lose if they are involved. But another group of people are also facing the chicken charge and that is the broadcasters, the great unknown, will we be prepared to go ahead with these debates without the Prime Minister. My sense is that talking to people involved in these negotiations, the broadcasters are deeply cautious about going down that road. The truth, there are a lot of dead parrots and chickens flapping about the place. The number of visits to A&E in England has soared by more than 400,000 in the past 12 months - the equivalent of filling an extra nine emergency departments. That’s what senior doctors told MPs this morning. They were called to give evidence to the Health Select committee after it was revealed that A&E waiting times were the worst for a decade, leading to many hospitals declaring ""major incidents"". Our Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. It has been a tough few weeks for NHS and the Department. There has been an increase in the number of patients, many of them frail and elderly, and hospitals have struggled to meet government targets on the waiting times. The head of the organisation representing AMD doctors told a committee of MPs that an extra 1+50,000 patients attended A&E in 2011+. Many people would describe that isjust A&E in 2011+. Many people would describe that is just a 3% increase. That is true but the other way to describe it is to say that is equivalent to eight or nine extra emergency departments and of course we have not built or staffed or run those in the last 12 months. Over the last few months and the Department of this have been experiencing unprecedented demand for their services. The latest figures from NHS England show that the pressure has not relented at all. An increase in patient numbers is only part of the problem. The shortage of senior staff and problems discharging patients into the community all add to the pressure. But MPs were told that despite this, the NHS urgent care system in England is performing remarkably well. We need to be proud of what the NHS has done and has managed to stay close to what it has been asked to do. That is absolutely at the expense of enormous numbers of extra hours and enormous extra shifts and commitment put in by staff right through general practice, and with services. AMD waiting times are also an issue in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were some emergency departments are struggling for stop but MPs will be asking why an extra £700 million of government money for the NHS in England has failed to ease the pressures of the winter. You can find out how your nearest emergency department is coping by visiting our data tracker at bbc.co.uk/nhswinter. Put in your postcode and it will show you whether your local A&E is meeting the four-hour waiting time target. Newsagents in Paris say the first release a special edition of the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, sold out within minutes. It features a cartoon of the prophet Mohammed crying over the deaths of 12 people in an attack on its offices by Islamist extremists last week. Five million copies are being printed in total - 700,000 went on sale today. The staff at the magazine are calling it the survivors’ issue. Our World Affairs correspondent Nick Childs reports. A week on now from the start of the days of horror that gripped and shocked France and the world, what has been dubbed the survivors’ edition of Charlie Hebdo has hit the streets. And in record numbers, the normal print run of 60,000 extended to 5 million. The delivery vans spread out across Paris and the rest of France. And there will be versions in English, Arabic and other languages. From the early hours, they cued at the kiosks, a new act of defiance and solidarity in a still stunned nation. Ido not share all the opinions in Charlie Hebdo, but I think they can say anything they want. So I am for freedom so today I will buy Charlie Hebdo for the first time. It is the second place I go to buy it. It is almost always completely sold. Infact most French news stands had sold their day’s allocation before the sun rose. And characteristically the magazine’s front cover, a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad, saying, je suis Charlie, underthe headline, all is forgiven, is stirring the anguished debate over freedom of speech and religious sensibilities. The aspect of reconciliation I think is misplaced. To my mind if there was a genuine expression of reconciliatory efforts, then I would have thought that a blank page would have sent a more powerful message. In Marseille, more disappointed customers. As some Muslim countries and groups also express unease and some anger over Charlie’s latest depiction of Muhammad, leaving British Muslims a call for restraint. And some argued that today’s sensibilities over images of the prophet are a modern phenomenon. There are numerous paintings, images of the prophet and other prophets showing his face, showing other intricate details of him, which many Muslims revered and respected. It seemed to be this is a far more modern interpretation which does not seem to fit with Muslim history itself. Meanwhile the tributes are still growing outside the offices of Charlie Hebdo. As the full fallout from what happened last week continues to sink in. Christian Fraser is in Paris. The magazine has gone back on sale and the reaction has been unprecedented. Yes, extraordinary. They gathered here in their tens of thousands on Sunday and today in that same mood of the fines they snapped up every copy of Charlie Hebdo that they can find in the city. This kiosk behind me was 20 deep at seven o’clock. They sold out within one hour. We understand French broadcasters are directing people around the city two copies they might still find. A couple of lines on the investigation we have heard today. The two gunmen or three gunmen, had accumulated an extraordinary stash of weapons. We understand that Coulibaly, the supermarket gunmen had taken up a small bone of 6000 euros just before the attack would she may have used by those guns. They are investigating that line. And the woman, Hayat Boumeddiene, who we saw on her way to Syria, she was in the company of the 23-year-old man, that man has a brother here in Paris, an engineerfrom a top man has a brother here in Paris, an engineer from a top university. It is thought he may have been the man who put together the video of Coulibaly released at the weekend. So it is not always drop and social misfits who join this group and subscribe to what they believe. In this particular case, quite the reverse. Wintry weather is causing disruption across many parts of the UK with warnings of severe gales in some areas later this afternoon. More than 200 schools are closed across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland due to snow. The Met office has issued an amberweatherwarning for central and southern Scotland. Later this afternoon severe gales of up to 75 miles per hour are expected - and there are forecasts for snow, ice, gales and rain in much of the rest of the UK. Richard Lister reports. Dawn revealed a blanket of fresh know across much of Scotland for a second day. It wasn’t needed for everybody, but in cities, towns and villages local authorities had to battle against the elements to keep roads and pavements open. It’s quite wintry! I’ve had to work from home today. So it’s probably a lot safer to stay at home and not be travelling out. Wee-Mac I wouldn’t say I’m used to it but I’ve experienced it lots and lots of times. When you live a long time you experience a lot of different winters. Part of the Maine Road Inverness became a truck stop with lorries unable to continue. There were numerous minor accidents on smaller roads and some rail services were closed. Most Scottish schools were open but more than 100 had to be shut. The snow should be good news for the local ski industry, but the road to the slopes on Cairngorm mountain had to be closed for a fourth day. This was the icy commute in due to buy a woman in Northern Ireland this morning. Slippery roads and blowing snow a feature of many such journeys today. More than 100 schools were closed here too mainly in the Northwest. In Wales the biggest problem overnight was wind, a mini tornado ripped through this neighbourhood in Haverfordwest neighbourhood in Have rfordwest taking neighbourhood in Haverfordwest taking roof sections with it. I was absolutely petrified because I was thinking of my grandson, imagine if that had gone through the bedroom window. England has not escaped the wintry weather, a band of snow moved across the country from the south-west. These sheep were hunkering down on Dartmoor where all major roads were open but needed to be driven with respect. Spells of sunshine made it look all very tranquil, a brief calm before another storm blows in bringing with it 70 mph winds and heavy rain. In a moment we’ll get the latest from Northern Ireland and from southwest England but first lets go to our Scotland correspondent Laura Bicker who’s in Auchterarder in Perthshire. Here they’ve had about three to four inches of snow in the past 12 hours. Many schools are closed, as are many schools across the high lands. Some people struggled to work. For many it was just a struggle to clear a path to the end of their driveway. Road services and rail services have been disrupted and ScotRail issued a warning that services could be disrupted until 6pm tomorrow night because of more bad weather that is on the way. Scotland has been battered over the past week, hurricane force winds, power outages and now a snowstorm. There was high wind and heavy rain that is set to come back overnight. Our Ireland correspondent Andy Martin is on the Glenshane in County Londonderry. Clearly conditions are pretty ferocious where you are. I had hoped to show you a beautiful view of the mountains behind me but it started showing again in the last half hour and has been for the last couple of days and it is pretty much blanked out by white snow. To my left is the Glenshane Pass, the road that cuts between Northern Ireland’s two main cities, Belfast and Londonderry. In the Northwest 100 schools have been closed as far away as county to Rome, but in the East snowploughs and gritters have made sure there is a minimum of disruption -- and gritters have made sure there is a minimum of disruption -- County Tyrone. You can see the weather coming in from the south-east, it’s totally greyed out. We expect more snow and more disruption into early evening across Northern Ireland. Andy, many thanks. Our correspondent Sarah Ransome is on Dartmoor. It is clearly windy where you are. What’s the forecast? Well, it is and as you can see there is still a lot of snow here this lunch time. Some of the wintry showers we had this morning, those snow showers, have turned to sleet. Don’t be full by the Sun thatjust came out because temperatures here are well below freezing in the air temperature but the milk is underway. The local authorities tell me they have had gritters out all night because there was 1-2 centimetres of snow that fell here on the high ground on Dartmoor. I’mjust fell here on the high ground on Dartmoor. I’m just near Princetown on the Highmore. But the temperatures on the roads are rising and although the melt is underway here and the brief respite we’ve had from the snow is here, but we expect later in common with the others is heavy rain and high winds later, some of them up to 75 mph on exposed coasts. Many thanks, and also to Laura Bicker and Andy Martin. The time is 1:19pm. Our top story this lunchtime: David Cameron and Ed Miliband accuse each other of cowardice over the line-up for the General Election TV debates. And still to come: ain’t no mountain hard enough - two men trying to become the first to free-climb a wall of sheer granite - are in sight of the summit.

Diabetes UK says that poor care in England is causing deaths which could be avoided - and it warns that the current care models are not working. Figures reveal that fewer than half of the 3.2 million patients in England get regular checks to make sure their condition is under control. And only 16% of those with Type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes who were checked met the recommended targets for blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure. Currently, the NHS spends a tenth of its budget on diabetes and most of this goes on managing complications rather than preventing them. Annual tests are vital for spotting the danger signs for people with type 1 diabetes, helping to overt complications such as blindness, kidney failure or stroke. -- avert. Diabetes UK says the number of these checks being carried out has actually fallen. Part of the problem, it says, is that 80% of NHS spending on diabetes is on treatment rather than prevention. For three key treatments blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol targets were only met for a third of patients. Children and young people with diabetes are of particular concern. In 2012-13 only 12% of 12-19 year-olds had all their annual care checks. Diabetes UK says it’s not a question of spending more but of using NHS resources more widely. It’s time for a change for life Smart restart. For Type 2 diabetes which can be controlled by lifestyle the Government says it’s trying to get the message out loud and clear. Getting people active, eating a healthy diet and just keeping trim can all help lower the risk. With me now is Simon 0’Neill, who is the director of Health intelligence at Diabetes UK. Thank you forjoining us, Simon. Why aren’t people getting checked? In some places they are so there is a failure in some areas. CCGs across England maybe not putting enough time and effort into making sure people get the time and care they need and many dead have an action plan. Lots of people with diabetes don’t get information about their condition. If you don’t know you need these tests why would you have them done? It’s probably a combination of those two things. Are there certain groups of people who are more at risk of going without these checks? Definitely. The reports show that people with type one diabetes, up to 60% are not getting all of the checks, which is worrying. And we know that people of working age may not get as much access to as many checks as they might. That shows there is also a problem with access. Perhaps these groups who find it hardest to make an appointment with the GP, to see the doctor to get the tests done, they may be being missed out and we need to think about how those services can best meet their needs. What underpins the problem? Is the balance between treatment and information wrong? It’s not the resources, we think it needs a rethink for more prevention, prevention of type two diabetes but also the competitions by making sure people have these tests and get the information they need and are able to self manage and address the problem before the convocations become costly and expensive. Simon, thank you very much indeed. Pope Francis has travelled to the Tamil region of Sri Lanka to show solidarity with the victims of the country’s 25-year civil war. No Pope has ever been to the area. The pontiff visited a church that was on the front line of the war between government troops and Tamil separatists. Our religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt is travelling with the pope. They came from far and wide. From the oldest to the youngest to see the Pope. It was, they said, a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Catholics here to get close to the leader of their church. He’s different to the previous Pope and the Popes before. He’s very close to poor people. He is a leader who wants to be with common people, with the general public, so people love him very much. He’s coming for the first time and I’d really love to see him. And for Pope Francis this was a chance to be close to the people, greeting as many as he could amongst the hundreds of thousands here. At the open-air Mass he canonised Sri Lanka’s first Saint joseph Vaz. May Almighty God bless you, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. He was a missionary who looked after persecuted Catholics here over 300 years ago, on an island all-too-familiar with ethnic and religious strife. Today the Pope said religious freedom was a fundamental human right. Pope Francis’s words struck a real chord here in Sri Lanka when he said that true faith, as shown by Saint joseph, meant showing all communities regardless of ethnicity or creed. Later, travelling to the north of the country the Pope led prayers at the Shrine of our Lady of Madhu. It was on the front line of the fighting between Tamil separatists and the majority Sinhalese during the 26 years of conflict. Last week’s smooth handover of power has given hope that the wounds of the past are being healed, though some fear the current peace remains fragile and more vulnerable once the Pope’s and the world’s attention has moved on. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News, Colombo. It’s said to be the hardest climb in the world, but two men have spent the last week slowly making their way up more than 900 metres of sheer rock. Tommy Caldwell and Kevin jorgeson are attempting to become the first people to free climb the Dawn Wall of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Here’s Andy Swiss. Inch by agonising inch, the two men trying to scale a new sporting height, El Capitan is 900 metres of near vertical granite. height, El Capitan is 900 metres of nearvertical granite. Imagine climbing it withjust nearvertical granite. Imagine climbing it with just your bare hands. Welcomer for nearly three weeks Kevinjorgeson and hands. Welcomer for nearly three weeks Kevin jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell have been doing that. Nails and nerves tested to the limit, they do have ropes in case they fall and they have, but nothing to help them up. It’s called free climbing, battling gravity, razor sharp rocks and freezing winds. It’s getting pretty rowdy. There are only shelter is a tent dangling precariously in midair. This is no place for the squeamish. El Capitan is one of the world’s tallest and most testing challenges. Nearly one, to hide it leaves man step -- man-made structures trailing in its wake, three times the height of the Shard in London and even dwarfing the world’s tallest, the Burge Khalifa in Dubai which is 828 metres tall. It has been painstaking and painful and they have even been climbing at night time when cooler temperatures made it easier to grip. With the summit insight and a famous feat is now within their grasp. As it goes on you feel a bit more hope and now we are at a point where this is really going to happen, but we won’t feel the whole immensity of it until they are standing on the top. The pair are expected to reach the top this evening, a feat of unprecedented climbing and courage. The achievement, like the view, simply breathtaking. Extraordinary. Time for a look at the weather- here’s Phil Avery. Some of the White on this picture will not move in a second because the sky is that clear you can see this snow across Wales, the Pennines and up into Scotland but in the West this cloud is moving. This is the first sign of wet and windy weather on the way. Before that comes, for some of us at least, the weather is not too bad. Further snow showers will add to significant depths across Scotland and the top end of the Pennines. The greater part of England is fine, dry and sunny but doing nothing for the temperatures for Northern Ireland, the western side of Wales and increasingly across West Devon and Cornwall. Yes, watery, but also very windy indeed. And itjust freshens watery, but also very windy indeed. And it just freshens all the while. As we go into the evening and overnight with low-pressure closing look at the strength of the winds. There we will seek disruption quite widely across the western areas. And then the threat transfers to the Dover Straits and inland areas where we could see the gusts pushing towards 65 mph. All the while the weather is quite wet at times, but not particularly cold given the amount of cloud. As we start the new day on Thursday with low-pressure close by, to the northern parts of Northern Ireland, the western side of Scotland, storm force winds with gusts of up to 70 mph and the tail end of the weather front pushing into Scotland and Northern Ireland, some more showers and wintry showers over the Highlands and through the course of the day the threat will come down towards the top end of England, the Midlands and over to Wales. Decent sunshine but it doesn’t do much for the temperatures. On Friday the low-pressure is still close by in the north-east of Scotland so windy fare here again. Notice the flow from the north-west, chilly and it enhances the showers at times and every time one of those fronts come through and we get a shot of increasingly cold air dragging the potential for the snow at lower levels. But I must stress, lots of fine weather but the daytime maximum is five or 6 degrees so you can only imagine how cold the Knights will be as we move towards the weekend. Further snow showers to be had occasionally at lower levels -- the nights. Follow the isobars down towards the British Isles from the Arctic and the winds are beginning to ease at this stage, so the nights become increasingly cold, lots of fine weather doing nothing for those temperatures. Stillthe fine weather doing nothing for those temperatures. Still the threat of something wintry in those showers. Lots going on. Full details right ",,

And 16,000 Metropolitan Police officers are to be issued with body-worn cameras. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. David Cameron and Ed Miliband have accused each other of being chicken at a stormy Prime Minister’s Questions. The row has erupted over the prime minister’s refusal to take part in any TV debates before the election in May unless the Green Party is also included. The Labour leader, along with the leaders of the Lib Dems and UKIP, have all written identical letters to David Cameron, saying it would be unacceptable for him to refuse to take part. Here’s our political editor, Nick Robinson. Yes, it is that time again, time for a man dressed as a kick in to haunt a leader who stands accused of being simply is too scared to face his opponents in election debates. When he says he doesn’t want to take part because of the Greens, nobody believes him. Not the people behind him, not the person next to him, not the country. However he dresses Ukip and the Greens both beat the Liberal Democrats, I’m afraid to say. Excuses, shouted Nick Clegg, who is backing Miliband, not Cameron, on this. Let me ask him again, why is he so chicken when it comes to the Greens? It is a debate about how to organise a repeat of the TV debates which five years ago, 22 million of us watched at least part of. Today, Ed Miliband found something which he, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage actually agree on. The broadcasters have made a proposal. The rest of us are prepared to go along with it. David Cameron should now stop ducking and weaving in and coming up with these excuses and just let the British people have those leaders’ excuses and just let the British people have those leaders’ debates. Talking of ducks, this is what the Ukip leader thinks of the prime minister. She can. He is running scared. Isn’t it interesting that when the Conservatives this week launched their big six topics for the general election campaign, immigration was not one of them. Exactly who stands where, who takes part in the next set of TV leaders’ debates could seem like one of those he said, she said rows between politicians. But it is about something more important. David Cameron believes that if he does take part under the current puzzles, they are stacked against him and he could soon be out of Number Ten. His opponents and so that if he will not go along with what the broadcasters propose, this is what should replace him, and empty podium. The current joint proposal from the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel A is for one debate with David Cameron and Edmonton, another adding Nick Clegg and a third adding Nigel Farage. David Cameron is proposing that the leader of the Greens should be added as well, and maybe the Scottish National Party leader, too. Not surprisingly, they agree with him. There is a clear way out of this, which is that if you say to the broadcasters that the Green Party should be there, we can all get on with debating the issues instead of debating the debate. This is a simple argument of democracy. It would be democratically indefensible for the SNP and for the Greens and Plaid Cymru and Wales not to be included in these debates. Publicly, the BBC director-general said today what he thought the opposition party leaders called for was interesting. Privately, some old casters say they are considering staging debates which do not involve the Prime Minister-- some broadcasters. The debates at the last election helped a quarter of younger viewers decide whether to vote at all. And almost half of them, who should they should vote for. This row is becoming a high-stakes poker game in which the prize is power. At the table, not just the political leaders, but the bosses of the biggest broadcasters. The only question - bosses of the biggest broadcasters. The only question - who is going to break first? The number of accident and emergency visits in England has soared by more than 400,000 since last April. That’s the equivalent of filling an extra nine emergency departments, senior doctors have told MPs. And after a leading A&E doctor said that some hospital emergency departments had seen none of a special £700 million Government fund, all hospital chiefs are to be asked exactly where the money has gone. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym reports. All hospitals are under pressure. Here at Ipswich, they have had a helping hand from the Army. Military medics in training have been doing their bit with patients. It is across England last week showed the worst performance for accident and emergency weights in a decade. Health chiefs were summoned by MPs to explain what was going on. A leading A&E doctor said the government’s winter funding boost for England had not made much difference, and he was asking hospitals to reveal whether they had even got it. It is clear that while some money has got to front line services, that is a geographically patchy finding. And many departments see none of the money. The Department of Health said the money had allowed recruitment of more staff in community health facilities as well as hospitals. But an NHS leader admitted that reforming the system to cope with patient demand would take some time. In answer to the bit about your question about, can we tell you that next winter will be OK, it would be foolish to say yes, because it is part of a 3 to five-year programme. Wigan infirmary prides itself on meeting A&E targets, but the last couple of weeks have seen unprecedented numbers of patients coming in, and a system under strain. To give an indication of the sort of pressure hospitals are -- indication of the sort of pressure hospitals are -- the hospital is under, there are normally only a couple of ambulances waiting to discharge patients. Right now, there are six. Helping elderly patients moved back into the community frees UP moved back into the community frees up badly needed beds for the daily influx of new admissions. Here, there is a special discharge lounge to make that happen efficiently. We have a very proactive team going out to the wards to wash patients and bring them down to the discharge lounge, which frees up the hospital bed sooner. The boss says they are coping for now, but he’s worried what the next few weeks will bring. I am concerned, because the real winter months are yet to come, and we have not had significant attacks on viruses or flu yet. Those things could make things worse. There will be no letup for a while for hospitals in their task of treating and moving patients through the system. An edition of the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, the first since the attack on its offices in Paris, has sold out within hours of hitting news stands. The publishers say they’ll increase the print run to five million to cope with demand. Al Qaeda in Yemen has posted a video online, claiming that it masterminded the attack on the magazine which left 12 people dead. Our correspondent Damian Grammaticus reports from Paris. Early morning, and lines were already long for the new copy of Charlie Hebdo. Within an hour, many kiosks have sold out. The print run is being increased to 5 million. And attributed to the magazine’s murdered staff continued to pile up. It has become France’s rallying point in the face of terror. This is the group, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, that says it finance and directed the attack. Vengeance, it said, for the Prophet Muhammad. directed the attack. Vengeance, it said, forthe Prophet Muhammad. So was Al-Qaeda more than just an inspiration? In a nondescriptive estate two hours from Paris, we searched for clues. This is where one of the Charlie Hebdo attackers lived. In the flat where his family used to be, we found new tenants, afraid. Finally, we tracked down his wife. She refused to talk. See my lawyer, she told us. She was arrested last week by police, but there was no evidence that she knew what her husband was planning. TRANSLATION:, Last Wednesday at 7:30 P-m-Â TRANSLATION:, Last Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., he told me he was going to see his brother, who was unwell. He kissed her goodbye and went on the tram. Totally normal. And that is the riddle of Said Kouachi’s life. What turned him into this, a ruthless killer? He blended into the background. His wife said he was kind, loving, nevertalked politics or showed an interest in guns. TRANSLATION: She knew nothing about it. She wonders how he was able to hide or that from her. He lied to her his entire life, even about his love for her. But perhaps a nondescriptive place full of mixed immigrant families was the perfect place for a terrorist sleeper to hide. The Kouachis’ neighbours are now afraid two, moving out of their flat. She must have known the man she married and had a child with, this woman tells me. If she didn’t, that makes it even more shocking. So the question they are asking here and across France is how many more Said Kouachis there are out there, potential attackers living under the cover of a normal life? That is also the nightmare for Western intelligence services. An edition of the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, the first The board of deputies of British jews is concerned about the emergence of anti-Semitism over the last year. Our correspondent has been talking to British Muslims and jews. Inside the East London Mosque, quiet contemplation and prayer. Outside, a lively argument. Freedom of speech is one thing. It is not one thing, it is non-negotiable. It is non-negotiable. That is why you came to this country. That is why we love this country. At a nearby supermarket, although condemning the Paris murders, ""je suis Charlie"" was not for everyone. The magazine is going to be sold in Britain. Do you think British people should buy the magazine? Absolutely not. They are taking the mix out of the Muslim religion. -- taking the mix out of the Muslim religion. -- taking the mix. I think this will stir up a lot of problems which we don’t need. I don’t want to see how the prophet looks like. Personally, that is not acceptable for me. The community will not accept that as well. That does not mean what happened was right. We are Muslims ourselves, and having someone from a different religion doing this is quite bad. With the magazine due on sale here by the end of the week, British Muslim leaders have called on those offended by what they see as the mockery of the prophet to speak out, but to speak out in a tolerant way. At a kosher supermarket, other religions are asking, after Paris, what is next? Many Britishjews are asking, after Paris, what is next? Many British jews are increasingly fearful. Armed guards outsidejewish synagogues and jewish schools in France. Should be in Britain. Without doubt. Why wait for a terrorist attack? It surges up. We are all very concerned for our children and the future. But this French student believes Britain is much safer forjews. I think it is not perfect here. There is also a jihadist threat, but on a day-to-day basis, Ifeel much jihadist threat, but on a day-to-day basis, I feel much safer walking the streets of London with a head covering, compared to Paris. Some in Britain will buy the magazine as a symbol of freedom, but for others, it is a symbol of offence. Our top story this evening: David Cameron and Ed Miliband have accused each other of running scared over TV debates. The prime ministers refusing to take part unless the Green Party is also included. Still to come, camping out on a Later on BBC London: The religious studies teacher who had sex with a 16-year-old pupil is spared jail. The judge says she groomed him. Rangers owner Sir David Murray has been put into the hands of the liquidators. More than 8,000 people have died from Ebola in the current outbreak in West Africa. The death rate among pregnant women is extremely high - almost 100% - according to the French Medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres. Our global health correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, has been given exclusive access to the first ever centre specialising in care for expecting mothers in Freetown in Sierra Leone. There she met with one of the few pregnant women to have survived Ebola. 16-year-old Lamatu is one of only a handful of women who has survived Ebola, despite being pregnant. Thank you very much for talking to us today. We appreciate it. But this is not her baby. She miscarried while she was ill. Now, she is caring for this little girl, who is extremely sick. I had a cold at home and myjoints were aching. My father knew he couldn’t keep me at home, so he sent me here. I was bleeding for two hours. No-one would touch me. After the bleed, I was put on a drip. I started to feel much better. Now I am recovered. Unfortunately pregnant women are very at risk from dying of Ebola, and complications related to Ebola. The prognosis for the babies, for the foetuses, is terrible. It seems to be a concentration of the virus in the foetus. On the other side of the capital, a new MSF facility. As well as taking Ebola patients from nearby villages, it will also specialise in caring for pregnant women who could be infected. Not one unborn child has survived from an Ebola positive mother, according to MSF. It is hoped this first dedicated maternity unit will help change that. Health workers are also at particular risk when delivering babies, because of the high volume of infected body fluids. The delivery moment, it is so high contamination moment that we need as well to take care during the delivery for the health staff as well. Sometimes we have extra protection, like an incubator, where you put your hands in the gloves and you can do the delivery, or accompany the mother without being exposed to some liquid by accident on your skin. Back with Lamatu and she is well enough to go home now, but she won’t leave the little girl, whose condition is deteriorating. Snow and gales have brought disruption across parts of the UK. Schools have been shut in Scotland and Northern Ireland, roads blocked and rail services suspended. In Wales, a tornado struck homes in Pembrokeshire. And there’s worse to come, with Met Office warnings of ice, wind and rain across the whole of the UK tonight and severe gales in England. Our Scotland correspondent, Laura Bicker, has more. Scotland had the chilly awakening. As blizzards carpeted parts of the country in deep snow. Keeping roads open through towns and villages in the Highlands and Perthshire was a challenge. More than 100 schools had to be closed. And in the worst affected areas, some found it difficult to get out of their own driveway. I had to work from home today. Probably a lot safer to stay at home and not be travelling. About two inches last night. It’s now two inches on top of that and growing. Parts of Scotland have taken a real battering over the last week. Hurricane force winds, loss of power and now this snowstorm and there are warnings that more bad weather is on the way. Part of the main route to Inverness became a truck stop as lorries struggled in the snow. But at this safari park, some found the new landscape, complete with new playmate, rather curious. In Northern Ireland, many schoolchildren in the north and west had the day off. Ice and snow made the commute a real challenge. It’s a bit of a nightmare. I used to love snow when I was younger because you got off school, but now I need the money! But professional surfer Alistair was determined to make the most of the winter waves. The wind caused problems for others and many a Tornado world through this Welsh town, ripping off sections of the roof. I was absolutely petrified because I was thinking of my grandson. Imagine if that had gone through the bedroom window. There was a lucky escape for schoolchildren on this bus when it skidded off the road. Driving conditions across the North of England were also tricky. Those on four legs found it easier in Shropshire. A further south, even the sheep were seeking shelter. Or perhaps they know what is to come. Another storm tracks its way towards the UK. The former girlfriend of the Lostprophets singer and convicted paedophile Ian Watkins has been found not guilty of indecency charges. joanne Mjadzelics said she’d been trying to trap Watkins by exchanging explicit pictures and conversations with him. The court heard she’d reported the singer, who’s now serving 35 years, to social services and the police on at least five occasions, but was ignored for four years. The Prime Minister will raise the issue of the last remaining British resident being held in Guantanamo Bay later this week when he meets President Obama. Shaker Aamer has been detained there for the last 13 years despite never being charged. Our correspondent, Aleem Maqbool, is in Guantanamo, where he’s gained rare access inside the US detention camp in Cuba. This month it is 13 years since the first men were sent to Guantanamo Bay and six years since President Obama said he would shut this place. Shaker Aamer Obama said he would shut this place. ShakerAamer is a Obama said he would shut this place. Shaker Aamer is a Saudi national, but has British residency. His wife and children are in London. David Cameron has raised his case before and will again this week. Shaker Aamer has been cleared for release not once but twice and that is the story of many others who remain at Guantanamo Bay. It was meant to be temporary, but Guantanamo Bay is still holding prisoners. We got to walk its darkened corridors and through the one-way mirrors used by the guards got to see some of the men who have been here for up to 13 years. The vast majority of whom have never been charged with any crime. But some are starting to believe their wait could soon be over. Here’s a standard cell inside this facility. That’s because the cells are fast emptying, from a high of well over 700 to fewer than 130 detainees remaining. There’s been a sudden spate of men released in recent weeks. This is Camp 5. It’s in this block that detainees who are seen as less cooperative are held, to punish them, to keep them away from other prisoners here, and they include the last British resident detainee, Shaker Aamer. He, like so many others, has been for years cleared for release, but his British wife and four children still wait for him. It is really mind-boggling that Shaker Aamer should remain in Guantanamo, or should have remained in Guantanamo for as long as he has. And as mind-boggling as it is to us on the outside, you can only imagine what it does to Shaker on the inside. But releasing those who’ve already been cleared, like Shaker Aamer, should be the easy part. The real test will be what to do with the prisoners still seen as a risk who, until now, have never been tried. There are those men who America feels have committed terrorism related offences that it doesn’t want to release. Human rights groups the evidence, try these men and close this place. Even today that seems a very distant prospect. Thank you. It’s nearly 900 metres of sheer vertical granite and said to be the hardest rock face to climb in the world. Two Americans are hoping to become the first to scale El Capitan’s Dawn Wall, in Yosemite National Park in California, using only their hands and feet and safety ropes. These are live shots. All they have to keep them safe our safety ropes. That see -- to keep them safe our safety ropes. That see -- stands between them and falling. Kevin jorgussun and Tommy Caldwell are just hours away from making the summit, as our correspondent Alistair Leithead reports. They call it El Capitan and nobody has ever free climbed its entire sheer vertical face in one go. Now, on the 19th day of their epic climb, Kevin jorgusson and Tommy Caldwell are finally close to making history. Free climbing means they only use ropes to break their fall. They can’t pull themselves up and when they do fall, they have to start that section all over again. They sleep suspended, high up on the rock face, whatever the weather. It’s getting pretty rowdy! As they’ve got closer to the top, a crowd has been gathering to watch from below. When it was first started, we thought it was impossible, never been done before. It’s 20 years ahead of its time. But Kevinjorgusson nearly gave up here, on the hardest section of the climb. His fingers shredded by the razor sharp rock. I really want to do this thing. After 11 attempts, some of them in the dark, and then days of rest for his skin to heal, he finally made it through. It’s really hard to get a sense of scale, even from standing here at the foot of this giant slab of granite, to get a sense ofjust how big it is. The London Eye, not even close. The Eiffel Tower, a third of its height. Even the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, falls short of this mountainous rock. A long time and a long journey of working on this. To see them actually getting close is just... It kind of hits me on a deeper level. And they’re notjust doing it because it’s there, but because they’ve spent seven years waiting to fulfil what many thought was an impossible dream. Wow! Right, time fora Wow! Right, time for a look at the weather. Beat that! That looks very challenging. The weather is a challenge at the moment. We’ve had snow and now we have the storm coming in.

It is a vigorous area of low pressure giving gusts in excess of 60 mph in the West. Initially there will be some snow in Scotland, but mostly a hill feature. The main concern is the intense rain and the powerful winds. By morning, starting to clear away from the south and east, but we have more powerful winds to come for the north and west, and still the risk of further snowfall over the hills in Scotland. I see at lower levels and some severe gales coming back into Northern Ireland. Further south, once the main rain clears away, there will be some heavy showers, and snow on the hills, but we should see the strongest of the gales moving away. Not a nice rush-hour in southern and eastern areas and not a nice day in the north and west. The next winds coming in across Northern Ireland and western Scotland in the morning and early afternoon. There are these bands of rain at lower levels, with snow on the hills. In the heavy bursts, they will fall as slow on the lower levels.

David Cameron and Ed Miliband have accused each other of running scared over TV election debates. The Prime Minister is refusing to take part unless the Green party is also included. That’s all for now, goodbye from Tonight on BBC London News: New details of electoral fraud emerge, levelled against the Mayor of Tower Hamlets. They include claims that some council employees were instructed to secure votes using illegal means. Also tonight: 16,000 Met police officers are to be issued with body-worn cameras. Plus, weather forecasters say expect a stormy night ahead. There are two warnings in place, and travel could be disrupted by gale force winds and heavy rain. More details to come. And this hidden part of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is now listed. But what’s its connection to this cult TV series? Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. First tonight, new details of allegations over election fraud against the Mayor of Tower Hamlets. A group of residents is trying to get last year’s vote re-run, claiming Lutfur Rahman won his second term illegally. They’ve submitted papers at the High Court containing the detail of allegations of electoral fraud. They include claims that council employees were instructed to use illegal means to secure votes for the Mayor. He has continued to deny any wrongdoing. Our political editor Tim Donovan reports. Allegations over what happened in the mayoral election in Tower Hamlets go before a special court next month, and fresh details have emerged in papers filed with the court. It’s alleged that at a meeting at a restaurant, 30 council employees were instructed on pain of losing theirjobs to obtain 100 votes each for the mayor, and it’s claimed it was made clear these votes should be obtained by illegal means, including through postal voting fraud. At another meeting, it’s alleged the mayor himself instructed activists to fill in up to 250 postal vote application forms each, and that each activist there was given a bundle of forms. The mayor says both these meetings didn’t happen, they are a fabrication. Among the other claims is that a letter to a local newspaper in support of Lutfur Rahman, signed by 100 mosque chairmen and madrassa head teachers, had the effect of indicating that a vote against him would be unislamic and sinful. The mayor’s spokesman says at no point did religious figures use spiritual coercion to procure votes. There’s also an allegation that in one instance during the count itself, some votes for other candidates were counted as votes for Mr Rahman, again dismissed by the mayor’s spokesman as unfounded. These new allegations will be considered alongside those already made when the case is heard here at the Royal Courts ofjustice next month. A case that is going ahead after a High Courtjudge rejected a bid by Lutfur Rahman and Tower Hamlets to have the legal action thrown out. He’s been backed by prominent supporters, and Lutfur Rahman continues to deny all the allegations against him. In a statement today, he said: Separately, two external commissioners sent in by the government are now overseeing some of the council’s services. Lots more to come, including: This woman owns a French book shop in South Kensington. She tells us why she’s planning on stocking Charlie Hebdo. 16,000 Metropolitan Police officers are to be issued with body-worn cameras by spring next year. It follows a successful trial of the recording devices. It’s hoped the cameras will be effective in gathering evidence, particularly in domestic violence cases.

What we’re seeing, in those areas where we’ve been able to use body-worn video, it always leads to a conviction. Because it’s very powerful evidence. It’s available for both charging decisions to CPS, and obviously, in court without the victim having to come forward. BBC London visited Rialto in California last year to see what impact small cameras had on policing. The results were dramatic. The use of force by officers fell by 60%, complaints against them by almost 90%. Back here in the UK, it also provides clear evidence, particularly in domestic violence cases. As an officer arrives at the scene of an offence, the first thing that happens is the victim will approach you at the door, and if a child arrives terrified and crying, and has got blood on theirface, or there is blood smeared down the wall, the fact that you don’t record the incident, the fact that the woman is too frightened to talk to you while the offender’s stood there, but when they’ve moved,... You’ve got a lot more richer information about what’s happened. It’ll cost £9 million to buy the body worn cameras for the capital’s police, but London’s mayor has given his full full support. The hope - they’ll speed upjustice and also make officers more careful about their own behaviour. A former Religious Studies teacher has been given a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of having a sexual relationship with a teenage pupil. Stuart Kerner had sex with the 16-year-old at Bexleyheath Academy in south east London. But today, the judge said that it was the obsessed pupil who’d groomed the teacher - comments that have been criticised by teaching unions and child abuse charities. Sarah Smith reports. Free to go home, his 18 month sentence a suspended one. Stuart Kerner denied having sex with a student, but was found guilty on two counts. Today, however, it was the judge’s comments on sentencing him which caused outrage. The 16-year-old girl was intelligent and manipulative, she said, adding the pupil had been stalking the teacher. The victim pursued you, she tells Stuart Kerner. If grooming is the right word to use, it was she who groomed you, you gave in to temptation. That suggestion, says one former teacher, is ridiculous. I don’t believe the judge even understands grooming, quite honestly. Maybe she should come on one of our courses, we were taught rhetoric, and she would then see the damage this behaviour does on a young girl. Whatever her upbringing was, whatever experiences she has had, maybe some of them too young in their life, I don’t know anything about the child, she was still a pupil. The jury held at the teenager and her teacher, then in his early 40s, had sex at Bexleyheath Academy, and that his family home in Aylesford. Stuart Kerner had been cleared of two charges of having sexual activity with a child, relating to the same girl, but When She Was Mine 15. Although she was the age of consent, 16, because he was in an age position of responsibility, it was an offence. Teacherjeremy Forrest wasjailed for was an offence. Teacherjeremy Forrest was jailed for five and a half years were taking a pupil to France. He had had sex with her when she wasjust 15. Today, the judge described Stuart Kerner as having been emotionally fragile, that these are just genuine groomed by a 16-year-old girl is appalling, says one MP. Thejudge seems to one MP. The judge seems to be partially blaming the girl, and this is complete nonsense. Teachers, adults, have a responsibility to behave like teachers and adults, regardless of the behaviour of the children in their care. Stuart Kerner may not be going to prison, but he will be placed on the sex offenders’ register. More than 100 patients in Hertfordshire have had their medication changed or surgery dates moved after an investigation into the quality of heart scans they received. The West Herts Hospitals NHS Trust, which covers Watford, St Albans and Hemel Hempstead, re-examined more than 3,000 cases following concerns about scans carried out by four staff members. The Trust says improvements have been made, including extra competency checks. Firefighters in Essex have begun three days of strike action in a row overjobs. Members of the Fire Brigades Union claim the fire service is planning to cut up to 200 jobs. The acting Chief Fire Officer says service managers have supported the principles of the consultation. But the union insist their compromise would result in fewer cuts. The compromise solutions we have put forward meet all of their drivers for change. We make all their savings, or the efficiency savings, and also, there is no detriment to the service being provided by the public of Essex. Over Christmas, thousands of train passengers had horrendous journeys after engineering works over-ran at King’s Cross. Today Network Rail has been explaining what went wrong. It’s told MPs that a decision by local station staff at Finsbury Park to switch platforms led to the serious overcrowding on the station. Here’s our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards. jonathan Nichols had a terrible experience travelling just after Christmas. This is what greeted him at Finsbury Park station, where he went to catch a train, after King’s Cross failed to open in time. It was bewilderment, as to how that kind of situation had arose with nobody there to deal with anything. A complete lack of information, not knowing what is happening, and fearing for your personal safety is unfathomable in this day and age. It does appear that there are indeed some elements of false amongst the chaos. The equipment brought to reduce the risk of breaking broke down itself... And so the allegations continued today, as rail bosses face questions about what happened. Today, they apologised again. There was a sequence of individual, in their own terms, quite small events, but which conspired in such a way that they created this unacceptable situation for passengers. In 2007, there were similar engineering delays. Then, Network Rail was fined £14 million and promised it had learned the lessons. It is quite unacceptable. Whether it has is up to the regulator. Network Rail said that this Christmas, there was no alternative but to use Finsbury Park, and the root cause of the overcrowding was switching train platforms at the last minute. There was a stated preference in a conversation to wean the station manager and the signal box -- between the station manager and the signal box to continue to use platform for for the first train at the men. But you must have a rider that this is in the senior management level. Yes, that is right. And it was overridden by a less senior manager. ABBA that have happened? That is part of the investigation. Network Rail are now reviewing whether major work should be done Christmas, but for this to disruption, it could still face major finds from the rail regulator. -- finds. And there could be more commuter problems ahead. Gale force winds and rain are expected to sweep across London and the south east overnight, meaning there could be localised flooding and disruption to travel, particularly during tomorrow’s rush hour. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning to people to be alert. Alice Bhandhukravi is at the Dartford Crossing for us tonight- and it’s been something of a week for the weather? That’s right. It is cold and windy here at the Dartford Crossing here in Kent, last night, people living in north London, in Harrow, experienced something slightly different, something of a mini tornado. People in one street saw tiles being blown off, and one family had their garage virtually destroyed. The wind was lashing, and the rain, and I heard a bit of a crash. Then I looked out of the side window and thought, that’s funny. The garage roof does not look normal. Tonight, we are expecting some more severe weather, and that may well have an impact for commuters during tomorrow morning’s rush hour. Here are the Dartford Crossing, they may decide to close the bridge, meaning they could redirect the traffic through the tunnel, but that could mean heavier traffic than normal, and of course, I winds may cause problems for train passengers tomorrow morning if overhead power lines come down or if there is of the debris left on the tracks. -- high winds. The key bit of advice is to check before you travel. There could be speed restrictions in place, so there may well be delays on the trains. Network Rail say they will be checking rail lines throughout the night, and that they have chainsaw teams on stand-by if branches or trees fall onto the lines.

For the meantime, back to you. We will indeed. Thank you very much, Alice. Still to come this evening: What connects the cult TV show The Prisoner and Battersea Cats and Dogs Home? And I am on the red carpet in Leicester Square with Colin Firth for The Secret Service, his action movie debut. A bookseller in South Kensington has told BBC London why she’s planning to stock copies of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The publication, whose first edition since Islamist gunmen murdered 12 people at its offices a week ago, sold out in France today. But it’s expected that copies will be available in London on Friday. This report from Alex Bushill. Solidarity is a word we have heard a lots of recently, and in South Kensington and its French book shops, it means record interest in buying the latest edition of Charlie Hebdo, which will be sold here, but not until they can get hold of some copies, which will be on Friday. A lot of people here, French customers and also other customers, are asking for Charlie Hebdo, so that is why we think it is really important to sell it. And while she does not want to offend, she knows there will be those who are offended by its front Pa9âÂ those who are offended by its front page, which typically Prophet Mohammed with the words, all is forgiven. The Imam Abdullah Hassan of the East London Mosque will be among them. There is a perception among many people that Muslims are scared of critique, and Islam, from its inception, the Prophet Mohammed was being critiqued, but it is the manner in which Charlie Hebdo has depicted the Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, and the images are not just disgusting, they are pornographic. It is misleading to think that there is a singular Muslim view in all of this. London’s Islamic communities are as varied as the city itself, and yet if you come to, for example, Brick Lane, here in east London, you will find these issues have a particular resonance. They paid a harsh price. The people living here who attacked them are paying a high price as well. Both parties have expressed their opinion and suffered in the end. Freedom of speech is why we’re here, and the freedom we get down here is not something we were getting our own countries,. Adele is the Frenchman, and the London. When he put out this a sign outside his cafe and Brick Lane, he was threatened by a stranger who walked in and threatened his cafe would be smashed up. He was undeterred, this sign still stands. The community wants peace, and it is the community is -- The community wants peace, and it is the community is -- it is not the community who wants war. We can be stronger through little things like this, keeping a sign outside, talking. He uses that word solidarity as well. For him, it means a common cause with all of those who exercise their freedom of expression. Charlton have appointed their third new head coach in under a year. 39-year-old Israeli Guy Luzon takes over from Bob Peeters, who was sacked on Sunday with Charlton currently mid-table in the Championship. Luzon’s first match will be away to Watford on Saturday. Paula Radcliffe has chosen to make this year’s London marathon her final marathon before retirement. The 41-year-old world record holder has won the London marathon three times, but hasn’t competed in it for nine years. This year’s race takes place on April 26th. Some of London’s grandest addresses enjoy listed status so they’re protected from being knocked down. Now they’re to be joined by a cattery. But this isn’t any old cattery, It’s one of the original buildings at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. Gareth Furby has been finding out about its link to a cult 1960s TV show. At first glance, it could be something out of a sci-fi film, but in reality, this is very much state-of-the-art when it comes to caring for stray cats. We offer catalogues and to hide. These are their own privacy curtains. This is scarlet, a lovely lady, and you can see he has got one night. But what the chief executive of Battersea Cats and Dogs Home really wants to show us is a bit of head in London. Here is our original Catterick. And if you just happen to be a fan of the 1960s vault TV series, this all looks a bit familiar, you are on the right track. Because the setting for The Prisoner series, the mark Italian village of Portmeirion in Wales, was built by the same architect behind London’s first home for cats. The really interesting thing about this is, this was designed and built before Portmeirion, so was this the inspiration for that phenomenal village in North Wales? Now completely surrounded by the modern dogs and Cats home, the 97 work of architect Clough Williams Ellis has been listed so it can never be changed. It is an usual design, and asl never be changed. It is an usual design, and as I say, it is the kind he liked to do, even to the weather vane, with its the top, which is a nice touch to it. Where am I? So, how important is the listing of this large? Well, it was enough to get the Minister for culture whispering sweet nothings to a kitten. She has been named officially today by me, Whittington, in honour of this building behind me that has been listed. Whittington now has a new home, and the people who work in the large eventually will have one as well. It is now due to be turned into a visitors centre. -- the Lodge. Next: he’s perhaps best known for romantic roles in Bridgetjones’ Diary and Love Actually, and won an Oscar for his performance in the King’s Speech. Now Colin Firth is stepping into the shadows, playing a spy in a film based on the comic book The Secret Service. Here’s a look at what we can expect. Whether you see? I see a young man with potential. Probe hooked on your left. , yes. Very nice. What does this do? Electrocute you? Don’t be ridiculous. It’s a hand grenades. The other macro shot up! Well, the premiere of the Kings men is taking place at night. Our reporter has been talking to Colin Firth and one of his co-stars. joining me now are the stars of Kingsman: The Secret Service. Colin, is it fair to say this is your first action movie? The previous action were, nobody paid attention to, so let’s call this my first. And six months of training to kick butt on screen. Yes, rather humiliating and difficult. You play his protege in the film, so is this your first London premiere? I did want to my other film earlier this month, but I have to confess, it is my first on this scale, yes. What was it like working with the likes of Colin Firth and Mark Strong, Samuel jackson? It is a dream come true. Any young actor fresh out of drama school like I am, it is a wonderful thrill to work with them. I am going to get really cheesy now, it is wonderful to work with your heroes. It has been lovely. Is it fair to say it is a hot march to old spy films? It. It is something of a satire in a way, but with huge affection. Matthew Tait beams he loves, the things he grew up with, some things he misses, and uses that sensibility to make his own dreams country by putting them on the screen in his own fashion. It is a formidable cast, but which is the best bit? Was at the smart suit or the spy gadgets? Which bits did you enjoy the most? There was a day when Colin and I were eating fish and chips, and I turned around to Colin and a single mushy pea was perched on the brim of his glass spectacles, and as a pose that was probably the highlight of the shoot for me, because it made me laugh a lot. I’m not sure it was the highlight of mY I’m not sure it was the highlight of my next macro bless you. Sorry. Yes, it was me dressed up perfectly, and acting like a warthog. I’m sure by the end of it, you had formidable six-packs. Yes, I only wish it had stuck around. You had a lovely set of pectorals, though, didn’t you? It was the scene where you teach me to eat like a gentleman. I turned round and cup said, Colin, you have a set of pectorals there. And it never made the final cut. Well, if you like pectorals, action, and these do, you are in for a treat. And not one mention of Mr Darcy! We heard about the impending weather earlier, so let’s get the forecast with Phil Avery. Yes, Alice did an impeccable job of selling what is going to be a pretty grim do with regard to the weather. I have showed you a romantic end to the day. It will turn increasingly wet and windy from the West. We got away lightly today, decent sunshine, doing nothing but the temperatures. Out towards the West, a great shield of cloud heralds the arrival of a weather front and active low-pressure, which will stick low by to the top end of the country rather than our neck of the woods. Having said that, there is enough in its circulation for their already to be Met Office weather warnings for the intensity of the rainfall, the strength of the wind as well. Later tonight, we will see in the dust of about 50 miles an hour. We have had problems with the ferries, and there will be further problems. At the end of the night, so really quite heavy rainfall, and it looks as if that will be around, if you are commuting early in the east region, you will have to content with that on the platforms and Road, lots of surface water and spray, and gusty winds to greet you into Thursday. That is not all doom and gloom by any means. There is still some sunshine in there. There will be some blustery showers rattling along on a very noticeable breeze, and having had the highest temperatures first up, the day will be a chilly one, given the strength of a breeze as well. Never better than about six or 7 degrees, and then on we go through the evening. This time tomorrow night, and through the night, still the chance of some really quite heavy showers around, but Friday again, a chilly start, with some sunshine. You will hear a lot of snow in the forecast. That is not so much for us, although you will see some wintry weather across the high ground of the Chilterns, for example. On Friday, again, five, six or 7 degrees, and with the strength of the breeze from the north-west, it will feel chilly. That top temperature early on Thursday will be’ is, and I will remind you, as we get towards the weekend, we will be well down into single figures, and is in very cold nights to come. I did hear the word sunshine though! Thank you very much. A reminder of the main news now. Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of being scared of taking part in a television debate during the general election campaign. The Prime Minister has been criticised by opposition leaders for refusing to participate in a debate unless the Green Party is invited. The number of visits to A&E units in England has risen by more than four hundred thousand since last April. That’s the equivalent of filling an extra nine emergency departments, according to senior doctors. The first edition of the French Thank you very much forjoining us. Asad Ahmad will be back with our late news. Have a lovely evening. In 2010, Britain was facing a major financial and economic crisis. So the Conservatives took difficult decisions that have halved the deficit as a share of our economy and got Britain back on track. We’ve backed Britain’s businesses, cutting their taxes, reducing red tape, and investing in vital roads, rail and infrastructure. As a result, in just five years, there are 760,000 more businesses in our country. 'Since we started brewing three years ago, sales have gone so well,' we’re moving into our new, bigger premises this year and taking on more staff. We’ve been open just over six months now and business is going really, really well. We’ve helped Britain’s businesses grow and create jobs. Thanks to the measures we’ve taken, and the hard work of people across the country, there are now 1.75 million more people in work with the security of a pay packet to provide for theirfamilies. Now that I’ve got a job, after being out of work for so long, it feels amazing to know that I’m providing to give my son a better life. To help young people learn the skills they need to get on in life, we’ve delivered two million new apprenticeships. 'My apprenticeship’s given me the knowledge 'and confidence to progress in life.' Thanks to my apprenticeship, the future is bright. By backing businesses and helping create morejobs and opportunities, we’ve got Britain going again. And our economy was the fastest-growing of all major advanced nations last year. 'I’m proud to employ local people. 'We had a good year last year,' and we’re going to have an even better year this year. 'With our exports growing,' we have the confidence now to start looking at employing more people. With a strong economy, we can invest in the things that matter to hard-working families. New schools, so children get the best start in life. Front-line health services so your family get the care they need. We can’t go back to Labour’s way of more borrowing and higher taxes. Instead, we need to stick to the plan that is giving families peace of mind and security for the future. The choice at this election is really clear. It’s between a strong, competent team that have a long-term economic plan which is working, or the chaos of giving up on the progress that we’ve made and going backwards. We should stick with the plan, stay on course for prosperity and work to secure a better future for our children and grandchildren. Hello and welcome to the One Show with Alex jones and Matt Baker. Tonight we learn just how talented the planet Earth really is, as our guest is hosting a show that brings the best performers in the world to our screens. For instance, we find out that the French are very good at this: Please welcome, Warwick Davis! Good to see you. What was your reaction when you saw that? At what point did you discover you can do that? When I first saw it I was amazed. How do you discover? When I looked at the clip in the shows you wonder how people discovered they could do these things. We have a guy who can rub wasabi in his eyes with lemons. What was going on when he discovered that? Probably a mistake. Something on his hands. Don’t take it on a TV show It’s entertaining. It’s called Planet’s Got Talent, lots of clips, we will see some later. If you were on this show what talents would you showcase? I thought about this. The only thing I can do about this is juggle. thought about this. The only thing I can do about this isjuggle. Funny you should say that. We have iÂ£9UÂ9 you should say that. We have juggling balls here. I haven’t done it since I was a teenager. Hopefully ",,
88,BBC1 London,14-jan-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"times, Imppg Times, happy I’iigi’Vi’5, times, happg hights, happg Happy times, happy nights, happy days are here again! Welcome to Turf Moor... ..Stamford Bridge"". ..Old Trafford. 30 yards out and a curler... Oh, it’s fabulous! Van Persie was there... Drogba heads in. It is the equaliser! Great goal. They’ve scored three times... Sergio Aguero... Fletcher scores. It’s all over now. Live commentary and all the goals as they happen... Tonight at Ten: David Cameron under pressure to take part in televised debates before the election. Labour and the Lib Dems say he’s running scared. Ukip says the debates should go ahead regardless but Mr Cameron says the Greens must be involved. Last time the debates were seen by a total of 22 million viewers. This time, Mr Cameron says he won’t take part without the Greens. Why is he so chicken when it comes to the Greens? There is only one person running scared of these debates and that’s this Prime Minister. We’ll be asking how likely Mr Cameron is to refuse to take part? Also tonight: The latest images of last week’s terrorist attack in a supermarket in Paris. On the streets today Parisians queueing to buy the latest edition of the magazine Charlie Hebdo with its five million print run. The number of A&E visits in England soars by more than 400,000 but senior doctors say it’s absurd to blame the patients. And, climbing the rock face they call El Capitan - the Americans inching their way into the history books. On BBC London: Accusations of cheating in order to be elected as mayor of tower hamlets are strongly denied. How some passengers feared for their safety because of mistakes by Network Rail over Christmas. Good evening. The election is under four months away but there’s still no sign of agreement on holding televised debates featuring party leaders. Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip have all written to David Cameron urging him to take part. But he says he’s unwilling to debate unless the Green Party is also invited. The debates in 2010 were watched by a total of 22 million people and the broadcasters say they remain committed to staging debates this time. Our political editor Nick Robinson has the latest. Yes, it’s that time again. Time fora man, dressed as a chicken, to haunt a leader, who stands accused of being simply too scared to face his opponents in election debates. When he says he doesn’t want to take part because of the Greens nobody, but nobody believes him. Not the people behind him. Not the person next to him. Not the country. However, he dresses it up, everyone knows he’s running scared. We had a set of European elections this year and Ukip and the Greens both beat the Liberal Democrats, I’m afraid to say. You either have... Excuse, excuses, shouted Nick Clegg, who’s backing Miliband, not Cameron on this. It’s very simple. You either have both of them or you have none of them: So let me ask him again. Why’s he so chicken when it comes to the Greens. It’s a debate about how to organise a repeat of the TV debates which, five years ago, 22 million of us watched, at least part of. Today, Ed Miliband found something which he, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage actually agree on. The broadcasters have made a proposal. The rest of us are prepared to go along with it. David Cameron should now stop ducking and weaving, coming up with all of these excuses, and just let the British people have those leaders’ debates. Now talking of ducks, this is what the Ukip leader thinks of the Prime Minister. Chicken. Chicken. He’s running scared. Isn’t it interesting that when the Conservatives this week launched their big six topics, for the general election campaign, immigration wasn’t one of them. And that, I think, is why he would rather take the hit for stopping these debates than allow them to go ahead. Exactly who stands where, who takes part in the next set of TV leaders’ debates could seem like one of those he said, she said rows between politicians. It is though about something more important, David Cameron believes that if he does take part under the current proposals, they’re stacked against him and he could soon be out of Number Ten. His opponents answer, that if he won’t go along with what the broadcasters propose, this is what should replace him - an empty podium. The currentjoint proposal from the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel A is for one debate with David Cameron and Ed Miliband, another adding Nick Clegg and a third adding Nigel Farage. David Cameron’s proposing that the leader of the Greens should be added as well and maybe the Scottish National Party leader too. Not surprisingly, they agree with him. There’s a very clear way out of this, which is, if you say to ITV, to the broadcasters as a package, that the Green Party, you think they should be there, then we can all actually get on with debating the issues instead of debating the debate. You know this is a simple argument of democracy. It would be democratically indefensible for the SNP, and indeed for the Greens and Plaid Cymru in Wales, not to be included in these debates. Publicly, the BBC’s Director General said today that he thought what the three opposition party leaders had called for was ""very interesting."" Privately, some broadcasters say they are considering staging debates which don’t involve the Prime Minister. At the last election, a quarter of younger views of the debates said it helped them to decide whether to vote at all. Almost half, who they should vote for. This row is becoming a high stakes poker game in which the prize is power. At the table, not just the nation’s political leaders, but the bosses of the nation’s biggest broadcasters. The only question - who’s going to blink first? Nick Robinson, BBC News, Westminster. In Paris, the publishers of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo have boosted their print run this week to five million copies. It’s the first edition to be published since the gun attack on its offices by Islamist extremists last week which left 12 people dead. The militant group al-Qaeda in Yemen has said it ordered last week’s attack, saying the killings were vengeance for insulting the Prophet Muhammad. Our Europe editor Gavin Hewitt reports. Before dawn they were queuing at the kiosks to purchase what has been called the survivors’ edition of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. They said they would print up to three million copies. By 9.00am it was sold out. For many, purchasing the paper was a gesture in defence of their rights. For us it’s important to show that we are very proud of our freedom important to show that we are very proud of ourfreedom of speech. But travel to a suburb of Paris where a large Muslim community and many here found the publication disrespectful. When there is no longer respect it’s no longer freedom of expression, it’s an attack and this is clearly an attack. It’s humiliating, it’s degrading. In today’s edition there are 16 pages of cartoons with some drawn by those who were killed in last week’s attacks. Nothing here is sacred. There are drawings mocking politicians, religion, including Islam, the Pope is portrayed in a way that many Catholics might find offensive. jihadists are mocked with references to virgins. The images here are crude and sexually explicit. There was a first glimpse today of the terror inside the jewish super market where four hostages were killed. There is Amedy Coulibaly, gun in hand, standing behind a hostage, his hands against the wall. Hiding between the food aisles are some of those who were shopping inthe store. Today, a leading commander of al-Qaeda in the Arab peninsula claimed his group had planned the operation against the magazine Charlie Hebdo, as vengeance for the prophet Mohammed. magazine Charlie Hebdo, as vengeance forthe prophet Mohammed. In for the prophet Mohammed. In a town two hours from Paris the wife of Said Kouachi, one of the brothers involved inthe magazine attack, is still living. Her lawyer says she describes her husband as gentle. Last Wednesday, he gave her a kiss, and boarded a tram. She knew nothing about it. She wonders how he was able to hide all that from her. He lied to her about his entire life, even his love for her. President Hollande today visited a French aircraft carrier, he spoke of sending the carrier to the Middle East, of boosting defence spending. It is a country planning increased surveillance, isolating jihadists in jail, a President long regarded as weak has seen his approval ratings rise significantly. It isjust a week since France was shaken, a country changed by terror. A few gathered close to the magazine office today, the feelings are raw. A country told it is at war with no one knowing what that will bring. In the UK, where the English edition of Charlie Hebdo isn’t expected to go on sale until Friday Muslim leaders have called on fellow Muslims to remain calm and peaceful. In an open letter, they say Muslims will be hurt and offended but they should show restraint. Earlier, the Board of Deputies of British jews warned against complacency about what it described as the re-emergence of anti-semitism. Our special correspondent Lucy Manning reports. Inside the East London Mosque, quiet contemplation and prayer. Outside, a lively argument. Freedom of speech is one thing... It’s non-negotiable. It’s non-negotiable! That is why you came to this country. That is why we love this country. At a nearby supermarket, although condemning the Paris murders, je suis Charlie is not for everyone. The magazine is going to be sold in Britain, do you think British people should be buying that magazine? Absolutely not. It’s got a picture of the Prophet, taking the mick out of the Muslim religion, so absolutely not. I actually think this is going to create a lot of problems, unfortunately, which we don’t need. I don’t want to see what the Prohpet looks like holding a banner. Personally, that’s not acceptable for me and the community doesn’t accept that as well. That doesn’t mean that what happened was right. We haven’t even seen our own Prophet and we are Muslims ourselves. Having someone else of a different religion do this is quite bad, it’s quite horrific. And it’s causing some tension. A French Muslim cafe owner was threatened by a fellow Muslim for putting a je suis Charlie sign outside his shop. This was a freedom of speech basically. If I want to putje suis Charlie outside my shop, no one should tell me the opposite. I am not insulting Muslims. I am not insulting myself. With the magazine due on sale here by the end of the week, British Muslim leaders have called on those offended by what they see as a mockery of the Prophet to speak out. But to speak out in a tolerant way. At a kosher supermarket, other religions are asking, after Paris, what next? Many British jews increasingly fearful. Armed guards outsidejewish synagogues and jewish schools in France should bein Britain. You think there should be armed guards? Without doubt. Why wait for a terrorist attack and then put on armed guards? It surges up. We are all very concerned about it, we’re concerned for our children and the future. But this French student believes Britain is much safer forjews. I think it’s not perfect here. There is also a jihadist threat, but on a day-to-day basis, it’s much safer walking on the streets of London compared to Paris. Some in Britain will buy the magazine as a symbol of freedom, but for others it’s a symbol of offence. There are reports tonight that, from the US, that the FBI have arrested a man for allegedly plotting an attack on the US capital building in Washington. It’s thought he could have links with the so-called Islamic State. Our correspondent is in Washington. What can you tell us? We havejust had in Washington. What can you tell us? We have just had the court documents from the Ohio district court citing two offences, the attempted killing of a US Government officer and possession of a firearm with furtherance of attempted crime of violence. What seems to have happened is that the man who has been named as Christopher Cornel and had an alias on Twitter, bought a gun and researched getting a gun and 600 rounds of ammunition. He had also been researching how to make pipe bombs and had been looking into travelling to Washington to carry out this attack and had been looking at which Government buildings should be attacked. This is all according to the court documents that we have just received. It seems that the FBI joint terrorism taskforce moved in a little earlier on today when he took possession of the weapon and those 600 rounds of ammunition, that’s when they decided this may not be just talk, that he may have serious intent. Thank you. The number of visits to hospital Accident and Emergency departments in England rose by more than 400,000 in 2014 according to the latest figures. Parliament’s Health Select Committee has been taking evidence after the worst A&E waiting times for a decade. Experts said the reasons were many, varied and complex, but insisted that staff were doing their best. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, has more details. Hospitals are under pressure, staff are working flat out. Recent figures showed the worse performance for Accident & Emergency waiting times in England in a decade. I’m Dr Clifford Mann. Health chiefs were summoned by MPs to explain what was going on. A leading A&E doctor said the Government’s winter funding boost for England hadn’t made much difference and he was asking hospitals to reveal whether they’d even got it. It is clear that whilst some money has certainly got to front-line services, that’s a very geographically patchy finding and there are many emergency departments which appear to have seen none of the money. The Department of Health said the money had allowed recruitment of more staff in community health facilities as well as hospitals. One of the NHS leaders acknowledged reforms to cope with patient demand would take some time. In answer to the bit of your question about, can we tell you that next winter will be OK? I think it’d be very foolish to sit here and say this because it is part of a three to five-year programme. She needs to stayin hospital. Wigan Infirmary prides itself on meeting A&E targets, but the last couple of weeks have seen unprecedented numbers of patients coming in and the system under strain. just to give an indication of the sort of pressure the hospital is currently under. Normally there are only a couple of ambulances at any one time waiting to discharge patients. Right now, there are six. The ambulance crew are here now... Helping elderly patients move back into the community frees up badly needed beds for the daily influx of new admissions. Here there’s a special discharge lounge to make that happen efficiently. We’ve got a very proactive team here who actually go out to the wards, wash and pack patients and actually physically bring them down to the discharge lounge, which frees up the hospital beds sooner. The boss says they’re coping for now, but he’s worried what the next few weeks will bring. I am concerned because the real winter months are yet to come and we haven’t had significant attacks of viruses or flu yet. Those things could come and make things worse. There will be no let-up for a while for hospitals in their task of treating and moving patients through the system. Hugh Pym, BBC News. The latest figures show that more than 8,000 people have died from Ebola inthe current outbreak in West Africa. The death rate among pregnant women is extremely high, almost 100%, according to the French medical charity, Medicins Sans Frontieres. Our global health correspondent, Tulip Mazumdar, has been given exclusive access to the first-ever centre specialising in care for pregnant mothers in Freetown, Sierra Leone, where she met one of the few pregnant women to have survived Ebola. 16-year-old Lamatu is one of only a handful of women who has survived Ebola, despite being pregnant. Thank you very much for talking to us today. We appreciate it. But this is not her baby. Lamatu miscarried while she was ill. Now, she’s caring for this little girl, who’s extremely sick. I had a cold at home and myjoints were aching. My father knew he couldn’t keep me at home, so he sent me here. I was bleeding for two hours. No-one would touch me. After the bleeding, I was put on a drip. I started to feel much better. Now I am recovered. Unfortunately, pregnant women are very at risk from dying of Ebola, and complications related to Ebola. The prognosis for the babies, for the foetuses, is terrible. It seems to be a concentration of the virus inthe foetus. On the other side of the capital, a new MSF facility. As well as taking Ebola patients from nearby villages, it will also specialise in caring for pregnant women who could be infected. Not one unborn child has survived from an Ebola-positive mother, according to MSF. It’s hoped this first dedicated maternity unit will help change that. Health workers are also at particular risk when delivering babies because of the high volume of infected body fluids. The delivery moment, it’s so high contamination moment that we need as well to take care during the delivery for the health staff as well. Sometimes we have extra protection, like an incubator, where you put your hands inthe gloves and you can do the delivery or you can really accompany the mother without being exposed to some liquid by accident on your skin. Back with Lamatu and she is well enough to go home now, but she won’t leave the little girl, whose condition is deteriorating. Tulip Mazumdar, BBC News, Freetown. New images from Amnesty International are to be released probably tomorrow which they say show the impact of a major terrorist attack by Boko Haram militants in northern Nigeria. Few details have emerged of last week’s attack inthe town of Baga, but some reports have put the death toll in the hundreds. The Nigerian army has said it stopped another offensive inthe nearby town of Biu. There has been a marked escalation in violence from the group, which was responsible for the kidnap of more than 200 school girls last year. A former girlfriend of the convicted paedophile, Ian Watkins, has been cleared of possessing indecent images after she told the court she’d been trying to entrap him. Watkins, who sang with the rock group Lostprophets, is serving a 35-year sentence for child sex offences. joanne Mjadzelics said that she’d encouraged Watkins to send her images in order to expose his criminality. From Cardiff our correspondent, Sian Lloyd, reports. joanne Mjadzelics always maintained she had tried only to expose child abuse, but the 39-year-old found herself inthe dock, facing seven charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children. In 2011, the former sex worker went to extreme lengths to gather her own evidence against her former boyfriend, exchanging indecent images of children with Ian Watkins online. The prosecution portrayed her as a disgruntled ex-partner. She told the court she acted to help bring him tojustice, and the jury believed her. I feel like it’s been seven years, seven year fight against him, against police and now against the CPS and against this, I’d call it, malicious prosecution. As far back as 2008, joanne Mjadzelics had warned police and social services that the former singer in the band, The Lostprophets, posed a threat to very young children, but her concerns weren’t acted on. Last year, Ian Watkins was sentenced to 35 years after admitting the attempted rape of a baby and other serious sexual offences against children. The trial ofjoanne Mjadzelics has reopened questions about how police investigated Ian Watkins. There are three inquiries into the handling of the case. Tonight, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said its investigation is making progress. Eight officers are now under scrutiny. Cleared today of any wrong-doing. Forjoanne Mjadzelics, the findings ever those investigations can’t come soon enough. Sian Lloyd, BBC News, Cardiff Crown Court. Winter storms are hitting many parts of the UK this evening, with strong winds and heavy rain forecast overnight. Blizzards hit large parts of Scotland earlier today, covering much of the country in deep snow. Traffic and transport links were disrupted in parts of the highlands and Perthshire and more than 100 schools were closed. In Northern Ireland, some children inthe North West also had the day off following a second day of snow showers, some public transport had to be suspended. In Wales, a mini-tornado hit the town of Haverfordwest, damaging 24 homes. Two people were taken to hospital. The case of the last remaining British resident being held at Guantanamo Bay will be raised by David Cameron when he meets President Obama later this week. Shaker Aamer has been detained there for the past 13 years, but he’s never been charged. Our correspondent, Aleem Maqbool, was granted rare access to the detention centre, on the island of Cuba, which is run by the Americans, and he sent this report. It was meant to be temporary, but Guantanamo Bay is still holding prisoners. Cost approximately £17.5 million to construct. We walked its corridors, through the one way mirrors, used by the guards, saw some of the men who have been here for up to 13 years. The vast majority of whom have never been charged with any crime, let alone faced trial. Some have been tortured. These pictures gave many their first glimpse into this infamous camp. The orange jumpsuits, the shackles. Some of the most notorious parts of the prison, like Camp X-ray have now been closed down. Its prisoners moved elsewhere within the complex. Some of those who remain are starting to believe they could leave soon. That’s because the cells are fast emptying. From a hive of well over 700, fewer than 130 detainees remain. There’s been a sudden spate of men released in recent weeks. Well this is Camp Five. It’s in this block that detainees seen as less co-operative are held to keep them away from other prisoners here they include the last British resident detainee, jacqueser. He was picked up in Afghanistan accused of being an aide to Osama bin Laden. In 2007, was cleared for release. It is really mind-boggling that jacqueser should have remained at Guantanamo Bay for as long as he has. As mind-boggling as it is to us on the outside, can you only imagine what it does to jacqueser on the inside. Inreleasing those who have been cleared like Shake Aamer. What human rights groups have been asking for throughout the last 13 years is for people to be tried or released. Their focus right now is they want David Cameron to get cast iron assurances that Shaker Aamer will be released soon. We will have to see inthe coming days if he gets those assurances. ",,

BP has announced 300 jobs will be cut following a review of its North Sea operations. Workers at the company’s headquarters in Aberdeen were told 200 staff posts and 100 contractors would have to go. BP said market conditions, including high production costs and the falling oil price, meant costs would have to be cut. Our Scotland Correspondent james Cook is in Aberdeen. For many For TTISTIY people Kingdom, a low oil price is good news, driving down the cost of petrol and much else but here at the BP offices in Aberdeen and for many others in the North Sea oil industry it is a different story. The North Sea was already facing challenges, over the years ruling has become tougher and more expensive but since last summer, a barrel of crude has slumped from more than $100 a barrel to less than $50 and that has focused minds. Bebe announced that 200 staff and 100 contractors would lose theirjob. -- BP. They have already scaled back the North Sea staffing, now employing 3500 people here but other operators are making or considering cuts and some are fearing for the future. Oil prices continue to go up and down as we have seen before but we have not seen a situation as serious as this since 1986. It was devastating for the local economy but for guest houses, hotels, training centres, restaurants, shopping, everything was impacted. From rookies to veterans, the message from the industry is the same, they want the government to cut taxes to help them through the tough times. It is a game changer as far as the support required for the industry from the government, they need to get their act together and payback to the industry what the industry has contributed to the Exchequer. That message is echoed by Scotland’s First Minister. Most people see what is needed now and urgency which is changes to the tax regime and we have put forward specific proposals and I hope to see the government responding positively to them soon. Cheaperfuel responding positively to them soon. Cheaper fuel may be good news for the UK economy as a whole but in the oil capital of Europe it is nothing to celebrate. We have tried and failed so far to get an answer from the Chancellor of the Exchequer as to what relief if any he might be prepared to offer this industry but a spokesman for the Prime Minister said that they realise the falling oil price was good news for the economy but bad news here. They said there were ongoing discussions taking place and they were looking at what more could be done to help the industry but here, they regard that help is very urgent. Thank you. With me now is our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed. They are not the only oil company reviewing operations. Absolutely not, this comes after Shell announced job losses, another big Explorer has announced job cuts, it is like running an old car. The North Sea is a very old, mature field, we have been exploring the 1+0 years in tough environments. That means there are a lot more costs, every bit the oil get out is more and more expensive. Falling oil prices have exacerbated some of the problems that the North Sea was facing it any case. It is nowhere near the 1990s, the heyday of North Sea oil when we were producing over 1+ million barrels a day compared to just over a million now. The figures have changed in any case and the price change has put super boosters under that problem. It is not all bad news, near Shetland there is still Explorer and going on which BP is investing in -- still Explorer and going on which BP is investing in -- exploration going on. Butjobs are being lost by some of the businesses. At the same time, you have this big global issue of oil price where demand is falling and supply remains high and that has brought down the price. For a country that imports oil like Britain that is good news for the economy and consumers will see a boost from that but as james said, for the oil industry in the North Sea it will be tough times but not all gloomy. Thank you. Around 200 jobs are to be cut at the Cadbury factory in Birmingham. The company’s owners say the redundancies will be voluntary and phased in over the next two years. It said the Bourneville factory had to become more competitive. Fire has engulfed council offices in Oxfordshire and two other buildings following a spate of suspected arson attacks overnight. A 1+7-year-old man has been arrested following the blaze at the South Oxfordshire District Council building in Crowmarsh Gifford. Firefighters have also tackled two other blazes in the area. Our correspondent Duncan Kennedy is at the council offices. Everybody here is stunned about this triple set of fires this morning. The biggest was here at the offices of the South Oxfordshire District Council, a huge blaze that engulfed almost the entire holding. The second fire was 20 metres away in a funeral parlour and a couple of miles away in a thatched cottage there was a third blaze. They are all under control but police say they are linking the incidents and have arrested a 1+7-year-old man. It didn’t take long for the entire council officers to be set on fire. The place where 1+00 people work was engulfed from one end of the building to another. The extent became clearer with daylight, every floor across the officers was on fire. More than 1+0 firefighters are told the flames for several hours, the vast majority has been destroyed and it was not the only one. There was another fire at this funeral parlour a few metres away which was also badly damaged as the flames took hold on the ground floor. A couple of miles away there was a third phase at this cottage in a village called Rokemarsh. It was also gutted. Police say all three are linked, the whole series of incidents has stunned local people. Absolutely shocked, I wonder how it got so far, so high, and just thank God nobody was hurt as far as we know. I am God nobody was hurt as far as we know. Iam horrified, but no God nobody was hurt as far as we know. I am horrified, but no one was hurt, that is the important. At the funeral parlour we saw this gas canister in front of the door. One of the directors said it appeared to have been thrown at the building. They put a big gas canister through the front door, a car left the and it looks like they did the same at the council offices. What do you make of it? It is unbelievable, really. Police have confirmed a car was driven up the council offices before it was set on fire. The incidents have caused widespread damage to an office, at home and a funeral business, all in the space of a few hours. Here at the Oxford Council offices, a bomb disposal team has been here for about an hour this morning although there is no suggestion of any kind of terrorist incident, it is probably about the gas canisters. They have now left. All of the blazes are pretty much out and under control. As I said, the 1+7-year-old man is being questioned by police. Thank you. The Treasury has announced this morning that pensioners can now apply to buy bonds which pay higher than normal rates of interest. The bonds, for people aged 65 and over, were announced by the Chancellor in the budget last March. Experts have warned that demand is likely to be very high. Well, our economics correspondent Andrew Verity is here. How high? So high that this morning when people were trying to get onto the website that it temporarily did not function and there was an error message saying the service was unavailable. People can’t get through on the phone. When you look at the interest rates, it tells its own story. For years, savings have been shrinking in real terms because you could not get an interest rate that paid a higher rate than inflation after tax that has changed. The average rate is about 1.5%, after tax about 1.2% but inflation is now lower. Compare that to these ones, if you invest for one year you get 2.8% which is at least one percentage point higher than on the open market. If you invest the three years, you get as much as 1+% which is far better than on the open market and if you are lucky enough to have the funds to invest, you can invest £10,000 in each honoured. If you are a couple, two bombs each, you get interest far higher than on the open market-- you get interest far higher than on the open market -- two pension bonds. But building societies, who cannot compete, will struggle to attract funds so they may have less money available for mortgages. Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham, has said improving public health will be a major priority if Labour wins the general election in May. In a speech, Mr Burnham said it was time for tough action to protect children and tackle obesity. Maximum limits would be set on levels of fat, salt and sugar in food specifically marketed to children. Our Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. Sweet or salty, they are the snacks and treats that kids love but they’re not always the most healthy and Labour says it will regulate to improve the quality of our food if the industry does not act. Help, help! At a school in North London, Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham gets some hands-on practice at CPR. Another of Labour’s proposed policies is to ensure that all school leavers are equipped with this potentially life-saving skill, part of a raft of measures Labour says will help people to help themselves. Labour’s new approach is about empowering people with information to make positive choices to improve their own health and encouraging them to get more physically active. However, when it comes to children, we won’t flinch from taking tougher action to protect them from the harm caused by alcohol, smoke and sugar. So Labour says it will be prepared to intervene in the market to protect the health of children. As well as proposing new regulations on levels of fat, salt and sugar in food marketed to children, Labour says it will introduce traffic light labelling on other food to give people better information about what they are eating, as well as the immediate introduction of plain cigarette packaging. Some health experts have expressed concern over the levels of salt, sugar and fat in foods like these that are specifically marketed at children and the effect it might have on their future health. But when looking at the kind of regulation that Labour is proposing, the food industry says it’s not that simple. The things we are concerned about is the focus on certain ingredients and capping or limiting the quantity of those in certain products. That is much more difficult to achieve for the food and drink industry. A Conservative spokesman said it was naive to believe simply banning foods would encourage healthy lifestyles and pointed out obesity rates, alcohol-related harm and smoking had all declined since 2010. They questioned how effective and affordable Labour’s plans would be when tackling those big ongoing public health problems.

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has now claimed almost 8500, more than all other known Ebola outbreaks combined. And the total number of reported cases is more than 21,000. Among the many challenges facing health workers who are treating Ebola victims is the difficulty of working in full protective kit. Our global health correspondent Tulip Mazumdar has visited a treatment centre run by the charity Medecins Sans Frontiere in the capital of Sierra Leone, Freetown, and she sent this report. ~ I have been reporting on the Ebola outbreak of the many months now, and every time I come to a country like Sierra Leone, I speak to help workers to tell me how difficult it is to wear the personal protection equipment they wear to treat patients. I am at one of the MSF treatment centres. A nurse from the MSF has suggested I try some on myself. You will take me through these. Basically, the first stage is to put on the gloves. It is already feeling very hot in here. I have only been in it for five minutes. OK, I am only been in it for five minutes. OK, Iam kitted out only been in it for five minutes. OK, I am kitted out now. Obviously I am not going into the red zone but I will sit in this for ten or 15 minutes, just to get a sense of what it is like. Already, it has taken five or ten minutes to get into this kit and in that time I am sweating buckets. To be in this for an hour at a time like the medics are, it is difficult to imagine. We cannot go further because that is the red zone? Yes, wejust now further because that is the red zone? Yes, we just now wait for the decontamination. OK, we have had a walk around. How long have I been in their? 15 minutes. I have been in this for 15 minutes, and I feel quite out of breath. I am drenched, completely drenched inside here. I feel quite tired even though we have not done very much at all. If you were claustrophobic you could not do thisjob at all. were claustrophobic you could not do this job at all. The instinct when you come out is that you want to rip this off, but obviously you cannot do that. We have been nowhere near the red zone. If we had, we would be in a disinfecting session now, which takes ten more minutes of standing in this. Look at this. It is a bit grim, but... Gosh. Sorry about that! I was in there for about 15 minutes. Ijust walked up and down, just outside the centre. The medics that are doing this go inside for an hour at a that are doing this go inside for an hourat a time, hour at a time, they are dealing with very sick patients. I kept touching my mask, wanting to touch mY touching my mask, wanting to touch my face, if you do that then you have to leave. I got a very small sense of what it is like in there, but, really, Ifind it difficult sense of what it is like in there, but, really, I find it difficult to imagine how they are doing that every day, for an hour in each shift, three times a day. Amazing. Tulip Mazumdar there reporting from Sierra Leone. David Cameron and Barack Obama have vowed to defeat what they describe as the ""distorted ideology"" of terrorism, ahead of talks in Washington. The Prime Minister begins a two-day visit to Washington DC later. What will be on the agenda? There will be a lot of talk about the special relationship and standing together but behind that there are difficult issues for the men to discuss, notably the economy. That will dominate discussions over dinner tonight. They will talk about a shared agenda for growth and good jobs. There are announcements on about £1 billion worth of business deal. Britain’s trade relationship with the US is massive, we export price as much here as we do to Germany, which is the second largest export market for British companies. -- we export twice as much. There are British residents in Guantanamo Bay, Sheikh Ahmad has been in there for 13 years. There will be discussion about cyber-security, the Prime Minister will pressurise the president to do more for companies like Twitter and Facebook to share their information about radicals, talking about a tax on their sites. That will be a difficult discussion tomorrow. -- That will be a difficult discussion tomorrow. -- talking about attackss. S. A man’s been charged in the United States with planning an attack on the Capitol building in Washington. Christopher Cornell, who’s accused of planning to detonate bombs and shoot people as they tried to escape the explosions, was arrested in Ohio in an undercover FBI operation. Our world affairs correspondent Paul Adams reports. A lost soul or a home-grown jihadists? Christopher Lee Cornell, charged with plotting to bomb the US Capitol. This was the moment FBI officers tackled the 20-year-old, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah. Arrested moments after buying two semiautomatic rifles at a Cincinnati gun store. Shortly after we opened, and agents stopped by the stall who said someone would come by to purchase two guns and they wanted us to go ahead with the sale. Who would think Cincinnati, oh hey, and jihadists in the same sentence? The FBI said that Cornell was planning to bomb the Capitol building and shoot people. According to an unnamed informant he had researched how to make pipe arms. He does not seem to have received any orders from abroad. In one message, he told the informant, I believe we should wage jihad under the informant, I believe we should wagejihad under our wage jihad under our own borders and plan attacks and everything. Court documents said the FBI’s unnamed source is hoping to gain favourable treatment in a separate unrelated case. Cornell’s parents say their son has been, is to. He has been kind of lost -- say their son has been, is to. He has been kind of lost -- their son has been coerced. He did not know what direction he wanted to go in. I think he was very vulnerable. He never talked about any kind of violence or any of that to me or his mother, and he is a money’s boy coming he tells mummy everything. The FBI says Chris Cornell never posed a danger to the public but it will be up to the courts to decide just how dangerous Raheel Ubaydah really is. Satellite images of the Nigerian town of Baga have revealed the scale of destruction caused by an attack by Boko Haram militants last week. Amnesty International says 620 buildings were damaged, many completely destroyed. It’s helping to build up a clearer picture of an incident in which the government says 150 people were killed, while local officials says the true figure is 2,000. Our Nigeria correspondent Will Ross sent this report. These images, released by Amnesty International, show the devastating impact of a major Boko Haram attack. The first satellite photos were taken the day before the jihadists struck. Four days later, burnt-out buildings can be seen in Baga town. Amnesty says 620 buildings were damaged or completely destroyed by fire. Much of the north-east of Nigeria is extremely inaccessible and dangerous. So much so that these first pictures of the violence around Baga have come from these satellite images. They show the destructive nature of the group Boko Haram but they don’t give us any more clues as to how many people were killed in this violence. The extremist group has a long track record of violence against civilians. The Nigerian government says no more than 150 people were killed in Baga, but people fleeing suggest the number is far higher. On a visit to Nigeria, the former head of the United Nations spoke to the BBC about the crisis in the north-east. Their brutality, the murder of innocent women, children and men, cannot be condoned. They are determined to instil fear and intimidate the population in the whole area, and obviously the government, with the support of international partners, should do whatever it can to end the insurgency. This conflict is destroying communities and tearing helpless families apart. The Baga attack marks an escalation in the crisis. A lack of routine exercise may be responsible for twice as many deaths as obesity. Those are the findings of a major new research project by scientists at Cambridge University. After studying more than 300,000 people, they concluded that a brisk 20 minute walk each day can significantly reduce the risks of a premature death. Our health correspondent Adam Brimelow reports. This study suggests massive public health gains really could be as simple as they walk in the park. Previous studies have indicated just a bit of activity reduces the risks of heart attacks, diabetes, and some types of cancer. You are better when you go for a walk. I need to because I have but blood pressure and cholesterol, so I need to exercise. It makes us happy, puts us in a good moves, mix is healthy -- It makes us happy, puts us in a good moves, mix is healthy -- puts us in a good mood. Makes us healthy, gives us fresh air. This paper attempts to tease out the relative danger of inactivity and obesity. Drawing on data from more than and women across Europe over 12 years, it concludes just over seven in every 100 deaths were caused by inactivity, while about 3.5 in every 100 were down to obesity. The study suggests the biggest potential benefits for the people most in active. It is not about getting them to put on tracksuit and trainers and busting a long for a personal best. If they can do a brisk 20 minute walk each day, perhaps around the block or in a local park, then the benefits could be huge. That is why we are promoting the findings of the study, because it is staggering that there are such profound mortality benefit from relatively small changes in activity independent of obesity. Some experts say it is time to rethink public health messages. A lot of public money is being spent on trying to reduce obesity, rather than trying to get people active, and I think the emphasis should be more on trying to get people active. Inactivity rates in the UK are amongst the worst in Europe but this study suggest that little can go a long way. The faculty of Public health has welcomed the findings and called for more investment for people to be encouraged to walk or cycle to work or school. It’s 1.25pm, and just to let you know, if you’re watching us on the BBC News Channel, we’re going to take you Live to Los Angeles for full coverage of the nominations for this year’s Oscars film awards. It’s a vertical challenge that few thought possible. Two American climbers are celebrating after making mountaineering history by scaling what’s long been considered the world’s most difficult rock climb, the 3,000ft El Capitan granite cliff face in California’s Yosemite National Park. Tommy Caldwell and Kevin jorgeson spent 19 days free-climbing, only using ropes to stop them falling. Our correspondent Alastair Leithead was there and sent this report. Champagne on the summit after a climb that many claims couldn’t be done. On day 19 of their epic climb, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin jorgeson would just dots on the gigantic granite rock face. But, through a zoom lens, they could be seen climbing the last stretch to the top. Their families watched those agonising last few minutes, a mother praying nothing could go wrong. And then, they reached the top together. APPLAUSE Tommy’s dad and his young son were delighted. We are going to really encouraging to get a shower! -- We are going to really encouraging to get a shower! -- to encourage him. On the top, their partners were waiting for them, having him. On the top, their partners were waiting forthem, having hiked waiting for them, having hiked the long way around. Having reached the summit in 19 days in one client is a huge sporting achievement. It took a great deal of physical and mental strength for these two climbers to do something that had never been done before. Fans and fellow climbers had watched history unfold. Nobody has spent eight years trying to do one client, nobody spends 19 days on a continuous push giving a free climb. It is an heroic narrative, in a sense. President Obama even tweeted his congratulations. You remind us anything is possible, he said. The celebrations are continuing. And getting down? Well, that was going to be far easier and far quicker. It is not for me! Let’s have a look at the weather. The last of the cloud, rain and wind from last night pulling away to the continent and a bit of a lull in proceedings for the most part. We have seen some heavy showers, wintry on the high ground, but the thing that many will notice, wherever you have been, is that it has been very windy indeed, with gusts of about 70 miles an hour. That will be ongoing through the evening. Taking due to about rush-hour time, you can see those showers coming into Scotland. A game, wintry on the higher ground, so, too, for Scotland. The cloud I was talking about through Scotland and Northern Ireland, at rush hour it will be over the trans-Pennine routes. Filthy conditions here, the strength of the wind is a concern as well. Further south, at this stage, early evening, not too many problems. Windy, but not as windy as further north. Then, the band of whether gradually eases further south during the course of the night. It will keep bringing both wintry showers into the top of Scotland. -- wintry showers into the top of Scotland. -- those wintry showers. As the skies clear behind that feature, we may get some other significant problems. Notjust significant problems. Not just Scotland significant problems. Notjust Scotland and Northern Ireland but possibly across Wales and the Midlands as those skies clear, ice could be a problem. We could get a bit of snow across Kent, perhaps. Some sunshine further south. Further north, the bulk of the wintry showers. We will keep this cold, wintry feel to proceedings, despite the sunshine, through the course of the weekend. No pressure never far away. But at least the wind will not be such a feature through Saturday and Sunday. Having said that, despite the sunshine I think it will still feel pretty gold. The showers across northern and western parts will be quite wintry. Cold night on Saturday into Sunday. When you get into the countryside, there will be a widespread hard frost around, even in southern England. Those spectacular figures in the North show where you have the lying snow. If you are surrounded by snow, it will be a better start to the day on Sunday. Again, a lot of sunshine around and perhaps more of a breeze in the north-western quarter. Themes for the end of the week, staying cold by day and certainly by night. There will be wintry showers around but it is not all doom and gloom, there will be some sunshine. Hundreds ofjobs are to go at BP as it reviews operations in the North Sea. The company blames high production costs and a dramatic fall in the price of oil. Now on BBC One, time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Katharine Carpenter. It’s emerged a patient was left in a storage room in a hospital in Essex because its accident and emergency department was full. Michael Steel was admitted to the Princess Alexandra Hospital with an inflamed liver. But instead of spending his time on a ward, he was moved into a small room used for storing medical supplies. Gareth George has more. This mobile phone footage shows Michael Steele in the store room he spent three days in. Today, he told the BBC what it was like. It didn’t have a proper light, it had a big office light so I couldn’t turn it on because it lit UP I couldn’t turn it on because it lit up the building. When some of the nurses came in, middle of the night, they had to turn it on. It became a bit claustrophobic. There wasn’t any space, I had my bags, some of it was on top of my bed. I didn’t want to put it on the floor because the cleaners were cleaning. The Princess Alexandra Hospital has apologised unreservedly. And apology he says he accepts. Yeah, Iwouldn’t unreservedly. And apology he says he accepts. Yeah, I wouldn’t blame anyone in the hospital. Ifeel sorry for making the story public that you’ve got to do it. The footage was taken by his son who says he was amazed to find his father in a store cupboard. It was quite shocking really. It wasjust ridiculous. We want the best for him. He says he doesn’t regret going public with his experience, he hopes it may prevent it happening to another patient. The Attorney General has said current guidelines won’t allow him ",,

And the grandfather who woke up in a cupboard in hospital- because of a lack of room on the ward. And we are at Aberdeen HQ. After the snow, the high winds are back causing further disruption and power cuts. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The oil giant BP is cutting 300 jobs from its North Sea operations, with industry bosses and unions warning that there could be many more job cuts to come. The company is blaming falling oil prices, which have halved in recent months, and tougher market conditions. Several other companies are also struggling, and the Scottish government is calling on Westminster to reduce taxes on the oil industry. james Cook sent this report from Aberdeen. For Aberdeen and the North Sea, these are gloomy days. Production has halved in a decade as oil becomes tougher to drill, and the falling price is making things worse. Today, BP became the latest firm to announce savings and job cuts. 200 onshore staff and 100 contractors will lose theirjobs, while some feel worse is to come. Prices have gone up and down and they will continue to. We have seen it before. We have not seen a situation as serious as this since 1986. What affected that have? For the local economy was devastating. We saw up to 12,000 jobs going. Restaurants, shopping, everything was Restaurants, shopping, everything was impacted as well. And so, to keep businesses afloat through these tough times, unions and bosses here want the UK Government to act. This month we have cut taxes in the North Sea, and of course with the budget approaching we have got to look at what more we can do to support investment there. We have got record investment in the North Sea. There is a lot of oil under the sea there and we want to get it out. Since the first oil was pumped ashore in the 70s, how much you can extract has always depended on how much you can sell it for, and that is unpredictable. Brent Crude raised from $12 a barrel up to 140, and now stands atjust under 50. The big problem, say industry rookies and veterans alike, is that taxes were hiked when the price was high and have hardly fallen since. It is a game changer as far as the support for the industry from the government. They really need to get their act together. For many people a lower oil price is great news, driving down the cost of living. That is not the feeling here in Aberdeen, where some people say things could have been even worse if Scotland had voted for independence. It is not the case at all. It is a bonus to the Scottish economy that countries without oil do not have. The key thing, whether oil prices are low or high, is that we steward that resource properly. That has been the failure of successive UK governments. Cheaperfuel been the failure of successive UK governments. Cheaper fuel may be boosting the economy but here in the oil capital of Europe they are not celebrating. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed is with me here. Good news for the consumer? It is, broadly. The fact that we have lower oil prices is generally good for most consumers. Notjust lower fuel prices at the petrol pump, which we have all noticed have come down considerably, this will mean lower food prices, lower delivery costs for big retailers, lower prices for businesses, so it means that businesses themselves can operate more cheaply, hopefully passing on those cost savings to their customers. Will it last? Yes it probably will, this low oil price. There is far too much supply in the world, and particularly the game changer of American shale gas. There are 30,000 people employed in North Sea oil and if they lose theirjobs thatis Sea oil and if they lose theirjobs that is bad for the economy in general as well. Police are investigating three big fires in south Oxfordshire which started within ten minutes of each other in the early hours of this morning, at a thatched cottage, a funeral parlour and the district council headquarters. A 47 year-old man is being questioned on suspicion of arson. Our correspondent Duncan Kennedy is there for us now. Duncan. This has been an extraordinary series of events. Three fires, three separate locations, and the night one suspect. It all began at a village not far from one suspect. It all began at a village not farfrom here village not far from here about two miles away when a cottage caught fire and then it moved to a funeral parlourjust fire and then it moved to a funeral parlour just over parlourjust over my shoulder here, and then finally to the district offices over this shoulder, three devastating fires. Tonight we still don’t know why it has all happened. This was the moment the first fire began. Raging through the home of an 80-year-old woman. The woman was brought out safely. But then a few minutes later, two miles away, a second huge fire, this time at the offices of the local council. By daylight around 100 firefighters were battling to contain it, for several hours. At the offices, at the same time fire crews were also called to a third fire, at this adjoining property occupied by funeral directors. Eyewitnesses say they funeral directors. Eyewitnesses say they are stunned by the three incidents. This is unbelievable. We just saw lots of flames, lots of fire. It was very windy across the field, which was just feeding the flames. It soon became clear how much damage had been done, but not why. The cottage was destroyed. Neighbours here say they cannot make sense of the three fires. It is required strange. We don’t know what to make of it. We are alljust coming to terms with the ordeal itself, and just so happy that there have been no injuries or loss. At each address including the funeral parlour, these gas canisters were found. One of them appears to have been thrown at the building. They put a big gas canister through our front door, set fire to it. We saw the car leave the place, go around to the next place and it looks like they have done the same there. Police say that a car was rammed into the council offices. They say all three fires are linked and a man is now in custody. A 47-year-old local man has been so -- is now in custody. A 47-year-old local man has been so -- has been arrested on suspicion of arson and is now in custody. These incidents are being treated as criminal acts. Denied all the fires have been damp down, as do -- Denied all the fires have been damp down, as do -- as the investigation continues about the triple fire incident. Some newsjust coming in. There are reports that at least two people have been killed in anti-terrorism operation in Belgium. Police are understood to have carried out a raid in the town of Verviers, in the east of the country. Our Europe Correspondent Damian Grammaticusjoins us from Paris. What more can you tell us? This has all happened very quickly, and in the last hour the first report an hour ago of two explosions in this place, Verviers, a small town on the eastern side of Belgium. As you drive from Brussels heading towards Germany, just coming off the motorway, there is this place, Verviers. The police have said that they launched an anti-terror operation and two people have been killed, one other injured. Those all among the suspects. The police now saying they have the situation contained, so all is calm. Obviously questions about wider links from this. The Pope has defended freedom of expression following the attacks in Paris, but he said it had to have limits, especially when it insulted or ridiculed someone’s faith. Pope Francis was talking about the Paris terror attacks during a flight to the Philippines. He said the violent attack on Charlie Hebdo was by no means justified. Today, five of the people killed at the magazine’s offices in Paris were buried. From there, james Reynolds reports. The illustrator Tignous was carried to his grave in a cartoon-covered coffin. We must not be sad, his friends said. ""We mustjust be proud of his work."" The mourners share a passionate belief in the right to insult all religions, including Islam and Christianity. So can it be any surprise, then, that the Pope himself disagrees? On tour in Asia, Pope Francis demonstrated his side of the argument. TRANSLATION: It is true that you cannot react with violence. But if my good friend here insults my mother, he will get a punch. It is normal. But many in France may struggle to agree. Little here feels normal. Parts of Paris have become a kind of garrison; heavily armed soldiers continue to guard schools, places of worship and government buildings. And they remain deployed because this country still doesn’t know the scale of what it may be facing. A Muslim from Mali protected hostages during the supermarket siege. This afternoon he was given French citizenship. France is a secular country with all sorts of religions. The terrorists didn’t get that. They arejust criminals. And this is the city they struck. The debates over their motives now extends across the world. james Reynolds, BBC News, Paris. A look at some of the other stories making the news today. A man has died after a tree fell on his van in Lisburn, as gale force winds battered Northern Ireland. And two teenage girls were injured after being blown in front of a bus in Belfast. Thousands of homes were also left without power, although most have now been reconnected. Around 200 jobs are to be cut at the Cadbury factory in Birmingham. Currently around 900 people work at the site. The company’s owners, Mondelez International, says the redundancies will be voluntary and phased in over the next two years. It says the factory has to become more competitive. Google is axing its smart glasses, the so called Google Glass. From next week the company will stop taking orders for the product, which was launched in the UK last summer, costing £1,000. However, the company insists it is committed to developing future versions of the glasses. From today, pensioners can invest up to £10,000 in new government bonds which pay higher than normal rates of interest. The bonds, for people aged 65 and over, were announced by the Chancellor in the budget last March. The website selling them has been struggling under the weight of demand. Simon Gompertz reports. Bilston in Leicestershire, popular with pensioners, so a prime target for the Chancellor’s high-paying bonds. They are not all of one mind over giveaways. Pensioners already get a lot, we don’t bear the pain of the economic situation that we should. I tried to get the details through, got so far and the details jammed up. The local investment club, motto ""profit with pleasure at those quote, has had no pleasure trying to apply through national savings. It has been totally impossible. I’ve been trying since the first night, and you cannot get it through on the telephone. The website crashes. The problem is that there were so many people trying to do it with a panic that it had to be done today. And here is the attraction. If you pour your money into a top one-year bond from the banks, you would receive 1.7% interest. The new pension bond would PHY YOU interest. The new pension bond would pay you 2.8%, for a minimum of £500. Putting it away for three years, the best rate on the market is 2.4%. With the three-year pensioner bond, that will pay 4% a year. There you have to the end of that term to get it. Which of you are yes for the pensioner bonds and which are now? I’m a definite yes. I’m a no actually, I think I can get more elsewhere. No. A lukewarm yes. For mY elsewhere. No. A lukewarm yes. For my parents, yes. The interest is fantastic, it is an absolute no-brainer. The Chancellor has limited how many they can sell. Demand could overflow and that would leave pensioners disappointed. They are mostly keen on pensioner bond is here, but the phone and Internet failures have only heightened fears that there will not be enough to go around. Our top story this evening: BP announces 300 job losses, as the falling oil price takes its toll in the North Sea. And still to come: Caps on fat, salt and sugar in some foods. And coming up later on BBC London: How a sudden increase in homelessness in one London borough means families being re-homed in Manchester. And a record-breaking summer for our city, as more people come here to visit - and they’ve got a lot of money to spend too. loan to stay afloat but Ibrox has demanded security. It’s Britain’s biggest retailer, used by millions of customers, and until recently, it was one of the great corporate success stories of the past decade. But now the company is in trouble and it’s announced big changes to try to revitalise its flagging business. It’s closing 43 existing unprofitable stores and shelving plans for 49 larger supermarkets. But how will this U-turn affect the communities where they were going to build them? Our correspondent, Emma Simpson, sent this report from Dartford. It’s a journey of decline. For more than a decade, TESCO fought to open a new store in Dartford. Buying many of these properties. They have lain empty for years. At Christmas, signs and promises appeared. But days later, TESCO was pulling out. Folk here are reeling, including one of the last surviving shop owners on this street. They are too big to listen. It’s a let-down, TESCO, a let-down. They are too big a firm to do anything like this. They treat us like mugs, don’t they? Some communities will be pleased TESCO is no longer coming to town. But here, there is now a gaping hole in the centre of Dartford to be filled. A large lump of concrete is where my shop was. Started by my grandfather in 1908. Ray Richardson’s butchers shop was demolished five weeks ago, after he finally sold it to TESCO. It left a great hollow feeling, all those 12 years, for what? Absolutely what? What have they done to this town? They have absolutely devastated it. They have turned a successful market town into a town that needs more investment. Over the last ten years, our biggest grocers were snapping up plots of land and opening new stores at breakneck speed. TESCO expanded more aggressively than anyone else, but we’re not spending as much in large supermarkets as we once did and the space race is going into reverse. TESCO often seem to lead the way with changes in their strategy, partly because changing market conditions affect them first because they have three times as many stores as their next competitor. Tesco said it was pulling out with a heavy heart and it wants to work with the town to find a solution. But patience has been exhausted here, they want TESCO to sell up and fast. Hundreds of people are feared dead in Nigeria, after Islamic extremists attacked two towns. Amnesty International has released satellite images showing the devastation left by Boko Haram, the group that kidnapped more than 100 school girls last year. Now they have targeted the towns of Baga and Doron Baga, on the border with Chad. The government says 150 people were killed, but local officials says the death toll was nearer 2,000. Seen from SEED ‘fI’oITI SPBCE, coach Michael before it was attacked. And this is the same town five days later. Most of the trees have gone and according to Amnesty, more than 3,000 buildings were destroyed, raised the ground. More images of another town, Baga, over a mile away, show another 600 buildings were burned down. And highlighted in yellow, the buildings destroyed in both towns, these are the only images of the attacks that took place but survivors have been telling their stories. He loved his life savings in Baga, so he took the risk and went back... Our Diplomatic Correspondent, james Robbins, is with me here. All we have is these satellite images. What do we know about the towns that were attacked? We know that in essence, several towns have been all but eradicated. We do not know the casualty figures, these images cannot tell us that and there are estimates but what happened was horrific. One man who did escape told the BBC today, we are being killed like animals. He accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect people in the North East. Boko Haram is to many people the other Islamic State. It has a vision of Islamic republics where everyone must bow to their will. Boko Haram says anyone, including Muslims, who does not subscribe to their vision deserves to be murdered and they have been effective in doing it. Nigerian Armed Forces have been heavily criticised, it is a large army in the largest country in Africa, but they have criticised for failing to get to grips with, Iran. -- they have criticised for failing to get to grips with, Iran. -- with Boko Haram. Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham, has said improving public health will be a major priority if Labour wins the General Election in May. In a speech, Mr Burnham said it was time for tough action to protect children and tackle obesity. He said maximum limits would be set on levels of fat, salt and sugar in food marketed to children. Our health correspondent, Dominic Hughes, reports. A lot of fun, exercise and the right food,it A lot of fun, exercise and the right food, it is the best diet for the next generation. Now Labour says it wants to help a limiting salt, fat and sugar in food marketed at children. They have the best interests, it cannot heart -- They have the best interests, it cannot heart -- it cannot hurt if they can influence it. It is hard because at supermarkets, they put the sweet and the naughty things by the checkout. You do think your pets healthy so you will either for your child, you do not look at the ingredients -- yoghurt is healthy. Labour’s health spokesman believes we could use assistance improving the choices we make in diet and lifestyle. Andy Burnham was getting hands-on practice at CPR. He wants school leavers to be equipped with this skill. Other ideas include better labelling of food, the immediate introduction of plain cigarette packaging and action on low-cost, high alcohol drinks. We need to protect children by having limits on fat, salt and sugar. That is about building a healthier nation and that in time will take Russia away from the NHS. Some health experts have expressed concern over levels of salt, fat and sugarin concern over levels of salt, fat and sugar in food like this, it it at children. -- sugar in food like this, it it at children. -- take pressure away. But the food industry says what Labour is proposing is not that simple. We are focused on certain ingredients and limiting the amount of those in certain products and thatis of those in certain products and that is more difficult to achieve for the food and drink industry. The Conservatives say it is naive to think banning food would encourage healthy lifestyles and they questioned Labour’s plans and say progress has been made under the current government. It could be a bumper year for the Brits at the Oscars next month, after five actors were nominated this afternoon. Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley have been chosen for their roles in The Imitation Game. Eddie Redmayne and Felicityjones, who play Stephen Hawking and his wife in The Theory of Everything, have also been nominated, as has Rosamund Pike, for her role in Gone Girl. Our Arts editor, Will Gompertz, looks at the secret of their success. Who are you? I’m Zero, sir, the new lobby boy. Zero, you say? Yes, sir. Well, I’ve never heard of you and never laid eyes on you, who hired you...? Two quirky American comedies lead the way, with nine nominations each. Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Ralph Fiennes. And Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu’s Birdman, with Best Actor nominee Michael Keaton. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, what’s up? Competing with them for Best Motion Picture, two British films. The Imitation Game, about code-breaker Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who also gets an Oscar nod, as does his co-star, Keira Knightley. An electrical brain. A digital computer. Digital computer? And the Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity jones, both of whom are also short-listed for their performances. A singularity? A space-time singularity. Both The Theory of Everything and The Imitation Game are based on true stories, as are half of the Best Film nominations this year. As have been four of the last five winners of that particular Academy Award. So there certainly seems to be a trend towards recognising nonfiction storytellers. Which seems to play into the hands of British actors, who have been brought up learning their trade, treading the boards in old theatres like this. I came down here because I had this whole speech... It’s where they learn acting isn’t about being a star, it’s about learning how to embody the character. British actors have the ability and versatility to transform and I think when they are thinking about building character, what they are doing is, they are starting from inside and they are working out. They are building, they are putting on a character. I think sometimes, the American training encourages you to bring the character toward yourself. And you, who are you? Gone Girl lead Rosamund Pike was another British actor to receive an Oscar nomination, the first of her career. While Meryl Streep broke her own record by being short-listed for the 19th time. She will be up against Patricia Arquette, nominated for Boyhood, a film many think will win the prestigious Best Picture Award. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Helen Willetts. It has not been an enjoyable day in the North. We have got these bands of rain with Hill Snow so quite unpleasant if you are travelling, but equally across Wales, the Midlands and the North of England. And severe gales in the North East of Scotland. Elsewhere, those strong winds will ease and is well become the main focus of concern when travelling and wintry showers. Mostly in the North, not exclusively. We could have wintry showers in the style to start the day -- showers in the style to start the day -- the South. For many parts, a cold start with is to watch out for and more wintry showers -- cold start with is to watch out for and more wintry showers -- with ice.

We could pick up problems with the fog this weekend and temperatures not getting higher, struggling to get above freezing and buying night, the temperatures will fall away. In the countryside, temperatures significantly colder. But we will see wintry sunshine as well. But snow showers will be a risk and if you are travelling, keep updated with the forecast.

It was an affair with a 16-year-old pupil that cost Stuart Kerner a place on the sex offenders registered definitely. But he was free to go home rather than gaol. He was handed a suspended sentence because the judge felt it was clear his victim had groomed in. We understand several child abuse charities sent complaints to the very general’s office demanding that under their lenient sentencing scheme the case is reviewed. -- under their lenient sentencing scheme the case is reviewed. -- the Attorney-General’s office. But they have responded saying Mr Kerner’s crime is not covered under the scheme. This use of the word grooming in the way thejudge used This use of the word grooming in the way the judge used it, way thejudge used it, I think is quite wrong. But I think it is for those concerned to take the matter up. It is not just concerned to take the matter up. It is notjust the sentencing that has outraged charities, but the judgement behind it. A London Crown Court heard Mr Kerner took advantage of the besotted schoolgirl. He took her virginity in a store room in the same week his wife miscarried. The judge told Mr Kerner the 16-year-old was intelligent and manipulative, and that the pupil had been stalking the teacher. She added if grooming is the right word to use, it was she who groomed you, and you give into temptation. But church did add that the victim was also young and vulnerable. -- the judge. I think the judge’s comments are quite outrageous, to suggest a 16-year-old groomed her 44-year-old teacher is quite unacceptable. The man was in a pretty -- teacher is quite unacceptable. The man was in a pretty -- position of trust. We question her ability to take cases. We will make a formal complaint. Now the charge that kept Stuart Kerner out of gaol could be investigated by the official conduct an investigation is office. -- conduct and investigations. To discuss the sentencing further I’m joined now by legal commentator joshua Rozenberg. Did the judge do the right thing? You can see why she decided it should be suspended, after all this man is never going to teach again, he is on the sex offenders register, he has been very damaged by what happened to him by his conviction. But you might say an immediate custodial sentence was more appropriate. The Court of Appeal is not going to have the chance to review the judge’s decision to risk -- have the chance to review the judge’s decision to risk -- to suspend the sentence, because this offence is a specialised one of abuse of trust, and is not on the list of cases that can be referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney-General. Do you think this judge might get people calling for a change in the law so that it can happen? The Attorney-General has already been considering the scheme under which he has the power to refer these cases to the Court of Appeal. He will take account of this. It may be he decided there should be a wider range of cases including this particular offence, but the criteria for referring it may be different. There have been criticisms of the judge’s comments that the girl groomed the teacher. Will she be pulled over for making those comments? Thejudicial comments? The judicial conduct investigation office can review, but byjudges, but not complaints about a judge’s decisions. -- but not complaints about a judge’s decisions. -- can review conduct. It is possible to look at comments made by a judge, she was reprimanded a couple of years ago for saying that a burglar needed a huge amount of coverage to commit a burglary, and this was not to damage confidence in the system, so we will wait to see whether these very different remarks lead to further action by the investigations office. Stay with us tonight as there’s lots more to come before 7:00, including: The family from Bexley who say they may be re-homed in Manchester after a huge increase in demand for housing in their borough. It’s emerged that a pensioner who was admitted to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow was put in a hospital cupboard for three days because there was no space for him on the ward. The hospital have apologised for moving Michael Steele into the small room. Mobile phone footage of Michael Steele not in a ward but in a storeroom, today recovering back home he described how at first drowsy from treatment for an inflamed liver, he was disorientated by his unusual surroundings and asked his son to visit him. When it started getting light in the morning, I realised this was not right, so I text and my son and asked where I am, he said, right. His son took the pictures to highlight the conditions he was being kept in. It didn’t have a proper light, it had a big fluorescent one. When same -- some of the nurses came in in the middle of the night, they had to the light on. So it became a bit claustrophobic. I have my bikes and everything, some of it was on top of my bed. -- eggs. Eggs. It eggs. It was ridiculous. We want the best for him. Michael was in the storeroom for three days, the local MP said he believed what happened to him was a one-off. I think these instances are the exception rather than the norm. The staff are some of the best in the country, I see that myself regularly. But I hope this sort of thing does not happen in the future. The hospital has said it contacted Michael directly and apologised unreservedly. He says he accepts that apology. I wouldn’t blame anybody in the hospital. I suppose I felt sorry for making the story public, but you have got to do it. He said he publicised what happened to him to try and stop it happening to another patient. A 13 year-old boy has died after being hit by a bus during this morning’s rush hour in north London. He was knocked down on Fore Street in Edmonton just after 8 o’clock, and he was taken to hospital where he died a short time later. Scotland Yard said no action was being taken against the driver of the bus. Drivers of some makes of luxury cars in west London can expect to be stopped by police - as officers check to see if the vehicle is stolen. The crackdown comes after Scotland Yard found that almost half of all vehicle thefts in the capital are from cars with a keyless entry system. Range Rovers and BMWs in Kensington and Chelsea are said to be particularly vulnerable. So let’s find out more from Alice Bhandhukravi, who’s in Chelsea. Police say that criminals are using specialist equipment that can be bought on the Internet to make keys for the cars they want to steal. They can get into the cars and make away with them within one minute without the alarm going off. Some makes and models are particularly prone. For example the newer range Rover models. Last year in the first half of 2014, 200 native range Rovers were stolen without their keys, that is 10% of all stolen vehicles in London. It is a particular problem here in Kensington and Chelsea, last year 165 range Rovers were stolen in this borough alone, an increase of 600 and 20% on the previous year. -- 620%. The police here say they are tackling the problem by stopping drivers at night driving range Rovers and other vehicles which are particularly vulnerable to make sure they are the rightful owners. They also insist this type of theft affects all parts of London and indeed other makes and models of car, for instance BMW, Ford and Mercedes. Landlords cashing in on London’s rising property prices are being blamed for increasing homelessness by a third injust one ear in one London borough. Bexley Council says tenants are being evicted to make way for new tenants willing to pay more. As a result the local authority is having to re-house local people - as far away as Manchester. Karl Mercer has more. They are putting the finishing touches to new homes nestled a few feet away from the local council offices, but this borough is struggling to keep up with demand for housing. With local landlords are the selling up or putting them on top, the market is getting squeezed. Rachael and her family are feeling the squeeze. Her landlord wants to sell, she says they cannot afford to rent anywhere else locally. They were told that some local families have been housed outside the area. Some even in Manchester. I am employed in Bexley and my husband is as well, so it would be disastrous, we would lose everything we know and we are used to, our livelihood and self-worth, to be stuck in an area we know nothing about and probably with no prospects. Exley says homelessness in the borough has raised by a third in the last year. 675 local households are now in emergency accommodation, 176 have had to be housed outside the area. But five are in self-contained flats in Manchester. We all know about the house price issue, but we have a very good housing support service which is being used in this case, and I am confident we will secure a good outcome for this family. Real answer though with him for more of this to be going on and much more quickly than it is at the moment. -- the real answer. Still to come before the end of the programme. A new community takes root assist tower block is demolished. New artistic treasures of the Square mile are being rediscovered. London is booming. Not just when it comes to population or house prices, but also when it comes to people who just want to visit our city. In fact last summer we had more tourists, spending more money, than ever before. They came to see our world famous sites - many of which had record breaking years themselves. So what draws the world to London? Victoria Hollins has been finding out. Even ona Even on a cold winter’s day London still has an appeal. More tourists visiting than ever before. I wanted to visit the historical sites and also the beautiful gardens and the palaces. I love the friendly people, the weather’s great, the transportation is amazing. We take the train or the tube. An increase in half a million passengers on Thames Clippers. London’s attractions have broken previous visitor records last seen in 2006. 4.9 million people visited last summer. Those who are visiting are spending more. The historic Royal Palaces also saw a record-breaking year. a record- breaking year. The a record-breaking year. The market is becoming more competitive, but I think we in particular at the tower and London generally is very good at consistently investing to make sure the experiences of world leading. It matters that people want to come to London. The tourist industry and supports more than a quarter of a millionjobs, and the supports more than a quarter of a million jobs, and the overseas tourist market is worth around £11 billion per year. The British Museum is the most popular tourist attraction, in fact the free museums make up eight of the top ten most popular destinations. Americans were the biggest visitors, there were nearly 2,000,02013, competitor 100,000 visitors from China, a group who spends a lot but find it difficult to get visas. We have lobbied the Home Office to ease the visa situation, and we are getting 90% turnaround within 24 hours which is great news. We do not do as well from China as other cities like Paris do. When final figures for 2014 come in, it is likely we will have seen 17 million visitors to London, with more expected in the years ahead. The Duchess of Cambridge joined Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry today in a visit to a London primary school. The Duchess officially named the school’s art studio, which is dedicated to providing creative therapy to youngsters. Kate is royal patron of a charity called The Art Room, which maintains a dedicated art room in a number of schools in the capital. People living on an estate in East London - notorious for its high level of crime - have welcomed the demolition of its final tower block. Built in the 1960s, the Mardyke Estate in Dagenham originally housed workers from the old Ford factory. But over the years things went downhill- but now another thriving community has taken root. Here’s Charlotte Franks. The day many residents had been waiting for. Demolition of the last remaining tower block on the Mardyke Estate. An area once rife with crime and anti-social behaviour. People did all kinds of things, drug-taking and fighting. The six tower blocks were originally built in the 1960s for people like Adrian who worked at the nearby Ford motor company. ITIOloI’ company. I motor company. I worked on the sharp edges, the crankshaft, engine block. In its heyday the plant produced 37,000 vehicles, but as opportunities at the factory decreased, the estate became a less desirable place to live. But now in it’s place 516 new affordable homes. This is the hallway, the colour is spearmint but it looks more green. Violet lived in a Mardyke Estate tabla for four years, and the residents were involved in designing the whole -- residents were involved in designing the whole -- new buildings. But some residents feel the estate still feels -- But some residents feel the estate still feels -- lives up to its old reputation. There is no CCTV, even this morning mY There is no CCTV, even this morning my friend’s car window got smashed up. We have only been here a couple of years, and it looks very nice but there is still a lot of crime. But Adrian is perfectly happy in his new home, and as for Violet, she couldn’t be more content. If I won the lottery, I’d buy this place. We pla ce. We love it so much. After a disappointing performance in last night’s FA Cup third round, Millwall’s chairman has offered to refund all travelling fans - their tickets. Sara Orchard is here - was it really that bad? It was their finest hour. They are stuck down in that bottom three, and an FA Cup run would have been a nice respite. But it was a 4 goals 2-0 loss at Bradford last night. Today the Millwall chairman john Berylson said he would refund the cost of the match tickets for the supporters who had all paid in advance. They also said that he thanked the fans for their continued support during difficult times, and pledged further funds for players to help improve their results. Earlier this week I saw a campaign to try and get more women active. A lot of people have seen this since it was launched, and here in the capital the campaign is very significant. We have the greatest gender divide here in the whole country. It hopes to redress the balance. Proof if it were needed that the strides -- of the strides women’s sport has taken. The goal voted as the second-best 2014 by Fifa earlier this week. At Monday’s awards ceremony Stephanie Roach mixed with the great and the good. I thank everybody who voted. Closer to home there is still real concern about female participation in all sports. In London, the gender divide is greater than anywhere else in the UK. Figures from Sport England revealed that 43% of men in the capital do some physical activity every week. When it comes to female Londoners, that figure drops to 31.5%. London’s gender divide is 1.3% greater than the national average, among the theories put forward the hectic lifestyles in the capital and a lack of work life balance. But when it comes to the nationwide which, Sport England claims there is one underlying factor. Lots of women tell us, three quarters in fact, that they would like to do some or more sport. In talking to these women we found there were these unifying themes of judgement, -- this fear of judgement. This is what sport is that -- Sport England hope will be the answer, ATV advertising campaign. It is saying it doesn’t matter what you do and why you do it, the point is you are running and that is what you should be celebrating. If that message hits home, we could all be celebrating more moments like this. If you would like to watch that film again in full it is on the BBC sport website. Think of the City and you’ll be right to think of money, the Bank of England and skyscrapers. But hiding some of London’s little known treasures is the Guildhall Art Gallery. Not heard of it? Well, you’re not alone. But now it’s been refurbished and renovated - you might want to take a look. And that’s exactly what Ayshea Buksh has done. When the original Guildhall Gallery was destroyed in the Blitz, thankfully most of the artwork was safe in storage. Its modern day incarnation has now undergone a makeover, and given that collection, a new lease of life. It means that works which may have been previously hidden away can now be displayed to the public for the first time. The entire collection spans 400 years, and contains some foreigner half thousand paintings and sketches. -- 4500. For part of the capital not normally associated with art, but is impressive. The corporation began acquiring paintings after the great Fire of London, a panel of fivejudges paintings after the great Fire of London, a panel of five judges was put together to try and sort out property disputes. Their portraits were painted and acquired by the Corporation. The gallery is to Guildhall, and was built on the remains of a Roman amphitheatre. Spaceis amphitheatre. Space is not a standardised white cube space, it is a historic space and not every wall is the same length of the same height. So having to work with that and try and make a virtue of what we have got and how we can make our collection fit and come to life within the space we have got. Most of the collection as a London focus. With much Victorian and Pre-Raphaelite art. Pre- Raphaelite art. Rosetti was Pre-Raphaelite art. Rosetti was a great innovator -- innovator, and came from a great family of Italian immigrants into London. This picture reflects the cosmopolitan feel of this collection. The collection is now on display in definitely, and while it a be a valuable hidden treasure, it is also free to visit. Now the weather with Philip Avery. It is set to get colder, as we move towards the weekend. Not a bad night in prospect, it was certainly more wild weather last night. There is the cloud and rain from last night, there was some sunshine, quite a number of isobars in our neck of the woods, especially along the channel today. In turn we have got away with it I think to a greater or lesser degree. There will be some showers just coming through on that breeze perhaps towards the Chilterns, in town you could well stay dry. There is just enough breeze town you could well stay dry. There isjust enough breeze in the bmmu isjust enough breeze in the forecast to keep the frost at a unless you are exceptionally prone. Then we are off and running into Friday, if it is drive first thing, don’t be fooled because we have got the prospect of one or two showers coming through, coming in from the channel, and just a way to the south of our area, they may turn wintry if they have got some real power. Those temperatures will drop away if you pick up on any of the heavier showers. Friday into Saturday quite a chilly one, then Saturday because it will be quite equal start, the atmosphere quite cold at the moment. If any showers get through to us, do not be surprised if you see a bit of wintry is there. Temperatures again, if you are going to the big sporting events, four, five, 6 degrees. Saturday night into Sunday could be a real bone chiller especially out in the countryside. But we can as a whole, not too bad. -- the weekend as a whole.

It doesn’t help the current housing shortage. Take two housing shortage. Ta ke two tower Take two tower blocks, one a new- build with flats costing upwards of £325,000. The other, ‘60s built and council-owned. They are said to illustrate a new problem. Market specialists estimate 70% of new- builds specialists estimate 70% of new-builds are bought by foreign investors, and they are not homes, but a safe investment. Take Battersea Power Station, derelict for years. Battersea Power Station, derelict foryears. It’s for years. It’s being redeveloped into flats costing from £330,000 for a studio, right up to £6 million. 80% of the first 866 to be sold went to overseas buyers before they’d even been built. Here in Islington, the most densely populated borough in the country, the council have decided to take action on what they describe as the wasted housing supply. Labour councillor and Executive Member for supply. Labour councillor and Executive Member for Housing and Development james Murray wants to put a stop to the practice of buying to leave. The prices are so extraordinary, they are seen as places for a wealthy individual, quite often from overseas, to park their money and sit back whilst the value of the property goes up. If we are building new homes in the scarce space we have available, all of those homes have to contribute somehow towards the housing crisis. We reach Worcester Point, where james claims one in three of its 106 flats are not lived in. That is a pattern which we have seen in a lot of other new developments... The developers dispute the figures. The housing charity Shelter puts the number of long-term empty homes in England at more than 250,000. The council wants new rules that would force owners who buy homes in new- build force owners who buy homes in new-build properties of over 20 flats to live in them for at least a fortnight every three months or rent them out. If they weren’t providing that evidence, we would go to the High Court to get an injunction so they could go for a fine or a seizure of the asset. This is a private development where james claims up to half the 127 flats are empty. It’s in formerly scruffy bit of the East End that has gone up in the world. A studio sells for more than £400,000. john Thompson’s is Operations Director for the company who own this development. Many of these are empty, is that the case? It is rare for properties to sit empty for long periods of time. In London, in the city that it is, there is a great rental market. As well as thinking the figures are shaky, he brands their new rules unworkable. How do you know that somebody has stayed there for the 14 ",,
95,BBC1 London,15-jan-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten: Two suspected militants are killed in an anti-terror operation in Belgium. Police say the suspects who opened fire with assault weapons were believed to be planning a ‘major terrorist attack’. A third person was arrested in the operation which targeted a group of suspected militants returning from Syria. Suspects OpÃflÃd Suspects opened fire with weapons to Special Forces of the police. They opened fire for several minutes before being neutralised. We’ll have the latest from the city of Verviers where the operation took place earlier this evening.

As population in the capital approaches a record high, the Mayor sets out what it needs to cope with unprecedented numbers. And a teacher convicted of having sex with a pupil won’t have his sentence reviewed for leniency. Good evening. An operation by anti-terrorist police in Belgium, has left two people dead. The federal prosecutor said the suspects were on the verge of committing a ‘major terrorist attack’ and that they’d opened fire on security forces. He said there was no evidence of a direct link to the attacks in Paris last week. A third man was arrested as part of the investigation into extremists returning from Syria. The raid took place in the city of Verviers, about 100 miles east of Brussels. Our correspondent Chris Morris is there tonight. Yes, good evening, a week after the attacks in Paris, an alarming reminder of the scale of the threat that Europe faces from radicalised Islamist fighters returning from Syria and elsewhere. The authorities say that the investigation, which led to the raids here and in Brussels, was underway well before the murders at Charlie Hebdo. But nerves will be on edge. just before 6.00pm, in a small Belgium town. As antiterrorist police moved in, the shooting started. Volleys of shots and flames at the windows. Look closely and inside the building you can see what appears to be a police officer opening fire. They say that they had intelligence of an They say that they had intelligence ofan imminent of an imminent terrorist attack. The suspect is said to have recently returned from fighting in Syria. Here too they fired back. Local people could hardly believe what had happened. TRANSLATION: I saw a police car. Then I heard three big explosions, followed by gunshots, loads of them. At first I thought it was fire crackers. A huge security operation swung into action. There were ten simultaneous raids across the country. The suspects had been under Vance for some time. In Verviers, it all happened very quickly. This group was about to commit terrorist attacks in Belgium. During the search warrants in Verviers, certain suspects immediately opened fire with automatic weapons to Special Forces of the police. They opened fire several minutes before being neutralised. So a dramatic and unexpected night here. But the Belgium authorities have been worried by the high number of home-grownjihadists have been worried by the high number of home-grown jihadists who have been to fight in Syria and returned home. Tonight they acted against them before it was too late. Prosecutors believe that they returned to act on a grand scale. So security has been tightened across the country as forensics and intelligence teams get to work, looking for clues about what could happen next. More raids tonight in Brussels, again targeting jihadists thought to be planning attacks and more questions about how to deal with this growing threat. It may be that the Belgium police feared that the attacks in France could inspire the suspects here to accelerate their own plans. Certainly one thing highlighted by the French authorities over the last few days has been the need for better co-ordination between the police and the security services across Europe. In the last few seconds, there has been another small explosion, we don’t know what it is but for now, back to you. Religions have to be treated with respect and people’s faith must not be insulted or ridiculed. That was the warning delivered by Pope Francis today. He stressed his support for freedom of expression, but said there had to be limits and to underline the point, he said someone who cursed his mother could expect a punch. He spoke on the day more funerals were held for the victims of last week’s terrorist attacks in Paris. Our correspondent james Reynolds reports. Pope Francis, on tour in Asia. Maybe the most recognisable, recognisable religious leader in the world. He leads more than1 billion Catholics and has today chosen to speak for religion as a whole. He has already condemned the attack on Charlie Hebdo but on a plane to the Philippines, the Pope decided to deliver an extremely easy understanding to warning, religion should not be mocked. TRANSLATION: It is true you cannot react with violence. If my good friend insults my mother, he will get a punch, friend insults my mother, he will geta punch, it get a punch, it is normal! For effect, the Pope repeats his gesture. Charlie Hebdo itself has satirised the Pope. Now France, as a whole is considering the Papal warning. I think that the Pope is right to say yes to the freedom but be careful to the believers. It’s a relatively balanced way of thinking. But that’s not how Charlie Hebdo’s lawyer sees it. TRANSLATION: He seems such a modern Pope, yet the reaction is medieval. He says he defends freedom of speech but he does not tolerate anything offensive. The Pope spoke on the day that the illustrator Tignous was carried to his grave in a cartoon-covered coffin. Mourners share a passionate belief in the right to insult all religious. Tonight Muslim leaders in France are hesitant to talk. They have condemned violence but they have is struggled to get anyone to listen to their calls for an end to religious mockery. Now, Pope Francis has stepped in to make that call for them. BP is reviewing its operations in the North Sea, 200 jobs will go and a further 100 contractorjobs will be lost. Most of the cuts will be onshore. The oil giant announced a major restructuring in December in response to the sharp fall in the price of oil. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed reports on the reasons behind the fall, and what it could mean for the British economy. Stormy waters for the North Sea and for the major oil giants. From over $100 a barrel six months although, tonight the price of oil stands at just $:17. The economics of oil has changed, sparking cut backs and job losses. BP announced that 300 people would be losing theirjobs in Aberdeen. It is the latest in line. Companies are struggling. Revenues are falling and they are cutting back on capital expenditure the. As a part of that there is a lot of equipment that will be idle, a lot ofjob losses and production being shut and projects being cancelled next year and the year after. The Queen opened the first North Sea pipeline in the 1970s. Today the company said that the costs of servicing Oldfields is taking its toll. The government announced a plan to help relax taxes. We are to look at what more we can do to support investment there. There is record investment there. There is a lot of oil under the sea. We want to get it out for the maximum benefit for the industry, notjust in Scotland but the whole of the UK. But the critics argue that the Treasury failed to fix the roof while the sun was shining. They ignored it when the going was good, took it when the going was good. Frankly, Cameron and Osborne and the rest of them seem interested only in politicking for low oil prices for their constituents. So what are the forces pulling the oil prices down? The first is falling demand. China’s economy is slowing. So less demand for energy. The new movements on climate change and in America, the shale oil revolution has meant that oil production has gotten less. And in Saudi Arabia, they guard their market share. For BP it has been a tough six months, also for the other oil giants. But falling oil prices can be good for consumers and businesses, especially in a country like Britain, where we import most of our energy. The Bank of England said that UK growth would be boosted by lower oil prices. That will be scant reashuns for the 37,000 people that work in the North Sea oil and gas sector, fearful of being buffeted by a long-term fall in the oil price that could put their livelihoods at risk. David Cameron has arrived in the US for a two-day visit. He’s having dinner with President Obama tonight and tomorrow they’ll discuss the economy and a planned trade deal between America and the EU. Our Political Editor Nick Robinson sent this reports. They flipped burgers together in the Downing Street garden, they have eaten hot dogs at the game. Posing as friends in front of the White House. It is images like these that the Prime Minister is craving for as he returns to Washington DC today. This morning, President Obama and David Cameron are pledging to stand together... Together in their shared approach to building prosperity and defeating terror. The President seems to want to help the Prime Minister but I asked him, does he really call him, bro? We have a very good relationship. It is normal Barak and David, I hasten to add. But the point is that he became the President six years ago, I became the Prime Ministerfive President six years ago, I became the Prime Minister five years ago, we face big challenges in terms of security. Getting over recession, dealing in terrorism. We work closely together and get on very well. David Cameron’s first stop before the White House was here at the IMF. Hours before its boss had warned of worrying trends in the global economy. We see the global recovery continuing to face a strong head wind. But Christine Lagarde talks a better news back at home. There is promising recovery taking hold and continuing in the United Kingdom. Do today’s forecast mean for Britain that there are worse times ahead, I asked the Prime Minister? There are problems, slow growth in Europe, slower growth among emerging economies, challenges like Russia and Ukraine. There are warning lights but we must deal with them. Do you mean to say to the British public this may be as good as it gets for a while? I hope that isn’t the case because many of these challenges could be overcome. We could seek higher growth in Europe. The lower oil prices going to provide a benefit to many economies. But we have to meat and master the challenges in front of us. But he is not the only Brit in this town. Ed Balls is here as well, talking about his favourite team on morning television... Your pronunciation is getting much better! Norwich! More importantly, meeting the head of the US central bank and, later, the US Treasury Secretary. He issued this warning about what he says is the real threat facing the British economy. The biggest risk for Britain in the next few years, the biggest economic risk, would be for us to leave the European Union. We have a Prime Minister, at the moment, saying that is on the table. Over dinner at moment, saying that is on the table. Over dinnerat the Over dinner at the White House, and talks tomorrow as well, the Prime Minister and the President had a packed agenda. Notjust Minister and the President had a packed agenda. Not just the packed agenda. Notjust the economy and foreign policy challenges, but cyber terrorism. What matters most to David Cameron now is the fact that he is here at all. Satellite images of Nigerian towns attacked by Boko Haram militants show widespread destruction and suggest a high death toll, according to Amnesty International. Nigeria’s government has disputed reports that as many as 2,000 people have been killed. They say it’s closer to 150. Amnesty say witnesses report the militants killing indiscriminately, causing catastrophic damage. Our Diplomatic Correspondent james Robbins reports. They have been called the other Islamic State. Extremist fighters of go around, parading a captured Nigerian tank, are gaining ground. After they seized 276 girls from a school in April, public anger turned on the Government and the military for failing to find them. Go around’s grip on large parts of eastern Nigeria mean that evidence of their most recent atrocity is hard to obtain. But satellite images reveal some of the horror when they attacked two remote towns. The pictures come from an infrared camera. This is the town of Doron Baga, before it was attacked. The trees and vegetation show red. Look at the same position five days later, the trees are almost gone, most buildings coloured grey and burned to the ground. Amnesty International say over 3000 buildings were destroyed. Look at this, the town of Baga, just over a mile away. Perhaps another 600 Holdings raised to the ground. The pictures can’t tell the whole story. We don’t know how many people were murdered. Survivors speak of killing on a huge scale. We woke up to the sound of gunshots. We ran out and saw heavily armed Boko Haram men coming into the town. The soldiers tried to repel the attack, but they were overpowered, so they fled. A friend had left his life savings in Baga. He took a risk and went back after the attack. He said the whole of Baga was full of Woody ‘s. At the livestock market, he saw piles of bodies. It seemed to him to be a total massacre. Nigeria’s President, good luckjohnson, visited the region today for the first time in many months. Widely blamed for not holding Boko Haram, powerful voices asking him to do more. The government, with the support of international partners, should do whatever it can to end the insurgency. It is not easy. But it can be done. There is an election on now, and pressure for action has been growing, defined the kidnapped girls, to commit far more troops against the killers. -- girls, to commit far more troops against the killers. -- to find the kidnapped girls. And you can find more on that story on the BBC news website, including background on the Boko Haram militants. The Green Party says its membership has overtaken that of both UKIP and the Liberal Democrats today. The party now has more than :1:1,700 members. The Greens say they’ve been boosted by the attention given to the plans for televised debates during the election and the controversy about their exclusion from those plans. Google is withdrawing its smart glasses the so-called Google Glass. From next week the company will stop taking orders for the product which was launched in the UK last summer at a cost of a thousand pounds. However the company insists it’s committed to developing new versions of the glasses. Police investigating three fires in South Oxfordshire have arrested a :17-year-old man on suspicion of arson. One of the fires is believed to have been started when a car was driven into council offices. It’s thought the attacks may have been prompted by a grievance over local planning issues, as our correspondent Duncan Kennedy reports. What’s going on in Roke Marsh? Three fires, three locations. This, the first, at the cottage of an 80-year-old woman, who was brought out safely. But then, a few minutes later, and two miles away, a second huge fire. This time, at the offices of the local council. Around 100 firefighters battled to contain it. Much of the building was destroyed. Then, at the same time, 50 metres away, a third fire, at this funeral directors. Three incidents in ten minutes, and all apparently started deliberately, using gas canisters, including this one. They’ve put a big gas canister through our front door, set fire to it. Dad saw the car leave our place. Around to the council offices, and it looks like they’ve done exactly the same there. There’s speculation tonight that the fires may have been started as a result of a planning dispute near here. A :17-year-old man, named locally as Andrew Main, has been arrested by police on suspicion of arson. Thames Valley Police are linking these three fires. All three fires are being treated as suspicious. It is believed that a vehicle collided with the South Oxfordshire District Council building, prior to the fire. No-one was hurt in the three fires, which have left the offices gutted. The :100 employees will now have to be housed elsewhere. The blaze here at the council offices flared up again for a while tonight, before being brought under control as the investigation into this highly unusual triple fire incident continues. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News, in Oxfordshire. There are new calls for Western governments to demand the release of Raif Badawi, who’s been sentenced to 10 years in prison in Saudi Arabia and 1,000 lashes. Badawi is a blogger who’s written critical pieces about the Saudi governmment. He’s been told he will receive another 50 lashes tomorrow. His wife, who’s sought asylum in Canada, says the punishment is comparable to the terrorist attacks in Paris. Our Special Correspondent Lucy Manning reports. Raif Badawi’s website was about speaking out. But now he’s been silenced. The Saudi blogger, accused of insulting Islam. His family believe this is the 31-year-old being flogged last week in jeddah. Last Friday, the first 50 lashes, tomorrow 50 more and the same for the next 18 weeks. Allah hu Akbar! Raif Badawi’s liberal website covered religion, politics and free speech. It mocked Saudi clerics and praised secularism. In Canada, where they have been given asylum, his wife and children are calling on governments across the world to demand his release. TRANSLATION: Raif is a very peaceful and very respectable man in everything he says and writes. There is nothing to prove that he has insulted religion or attacked the government in any way. Why should he take such penalty, that he surely does not deserve? She points to the irony that Saudi officials joined world leaders marching for free speech in Paris last week. TRANSLATION: Saudi Arabia took part in the rally in France, on the very day after Raif has been flogged back home. I cannot find the words to describe how I feel. How could flogging Raif not be considered an act of terror? Tonight, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights appealed to the Saudi king to end the continued flogging of Mr Badawi. But those who know the Kingdom say it would be hard to stop. To us, it’s pretty barbaric. But it’s part of the legal code in Saudi Arabia, the form of Sharia law. There are many punishments under Sharia law that we would have long since given up. But that is the legal system in Saudi Arabia, which enjoys quite popular support. David Cameron says the Government does not approve of this type of punishment and his case will be raised. But supporters of Raif Badawi want Britain to do more to demand his release and don’t want the Government to put trade before human rights. We want the British government to make very, very clear to the Saudi government that this is unacceptable. I would want the Foreign Office to be calling in the Saudi ambassador and making that clear, face-to-face. Protests outside the Saudi embassy. But unless they listen to the growing outcry, Raif Badawi will be flogged tomorrow, and again, and again. Lucy Manning, BBC News. The films Birdman and The Grand Budapest Hotel lead the race for this year’s Oscars with nine nominations each. There was good news for British actors - five were nominated, including Eddie Redmayne, Rosamund Pike, Felicityjones, Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch, who said he was knocked for six by his nomination for playing the codebreaker Alan Turing in The Imitation Game. Our Arts Editor Will Gompertz has more details. Who are you? I’m Zero, sir, the new lobby boy. Zero, you say? Yes, sir. Well I’ve never heard of you or laid eyes on you, who hired you? Mr Mosher, sir. Mr Mosher! Yes, Monsieur Gustave? Two quirky American comedies lead the way with nine nominations each. Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Ralph Fiennes, and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu’s Birdman, with the best actor nominee Michael Keaton. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, what’s up? Competing with them for Best Motion Picture are two British films, The Imitation Game, about code breaker Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who also gets an Oscar nod, as does co-star Keira Knightley. Think of it. Electrical brain, digital computer. Digital computer? And the Stephen Hawking biopic, The Theory Of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity jones, both of whom are shortlisted and delighted with the news. A singularity - A spacetime singularity! My manager, who was staying at the hotel, was standing there with a phone, with a cacophony of screams and excitement coming from this wonderful team of people I’d been working with for 12 years, on the phone. I hoped that was good news. Both The Theory Of Everything and The Imitation Game are based on true stories, as are half of the best film nominations this year. As have been four of the last five winners of that particular Academy award. So, there certainly seems to be a trend towards recognising nonfiction storytellers, which seems to play into the hands of British actors who have been brought up learning their trade, treading the boards in old theatres like this.

The mother of Breck Bednar criticises Surrey Police for missing previous allegations against his killer. And are plans to make London ""the electric car capital of Europe"" on track? Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. David Cameron has defended a letter urging senior Muslims to explain how Islam ""can be part of British identity"", after criticism from leaders. The Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles wrote to 1,000 mosques after the attacks in Paris. The letter has angered some within the faith, who say it reminds them of sentiments expressed by the Far Right. Mr Cameron said Mr Pickles was ""absolutely right"" to send the letter and that it was ""reasonable, sensible and moderate"". Our political correspondent Iain Watson reports. Are the leaders of Britain’s Muslim community is doing enough to challenge extremism? Government ministers have written to every mosque in England as well as to community groups with a clear message. They say they should show young people that extremists have nothing to offer them, that there is no place for hate in mosques or any place of worship. What is happening in terms of extremist terror has nothing to do with the true religion of Islam. It is being perverted by a minority who have been radicalised. But everyone needs to help with dealing with the problem of radicalisation. Anyone frankly reading this letter who has a problem with it, I think really has a problem. The letter to Muslim leaders, signed by the Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles and the communities minister comes in the wake of the parrot attacks and says, ""we knew that acts of extremes are not representative of Islam but we need to show what is"", and there is a need to lay out what being a British Muslim means today, proud of your faith and proud of your country. This letter to the mosques raises many British Muslims that their condemnation of the Paris attacks. It also makes it clear that there is anti-Muslim prejudice in some parts of Britain and encourages any acts of hatred to be reported. But some say the government is undermining its own case on integration by thinking out Muslim leaders and placing the responsibility for attacking extremism firmly on their shoulders. The fact is, the approach, there should have been better consultation with communities around how best to address this. It puts leaders in a difficult position. They have been put in the public that the government is telling them what to do. Lets revive the spirit of the holy Prophet of Islam, the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. He said as long as it takes, persevere in doing right thing. How would he deal with these extremists? He would reject it wholeheartedly and say that the philosophy and teachings of Islam is one of communities coming together. Some Labour politicians say the government should be reflecting on why a whole series of initiatives have not yet successfully tackle the problem of radicalisation. I’m afraid to say that for a couple of years, the government took their eye off the ball and the communities Department have done little on this agenda for the last few years. The government has been denounced by some to the tone of its letter but ministers say they are offering reassurance and assistance to the vast majority of Muslims in Britain. Our assistant political editor Norman Smith is in Westminster. Is there a sense perhaps that this letter, however well-intentioned, may have backfired on the governor? I think there is a serious danger of that. This letter may become the letter of unintended consequences. Clearly, there is no desire in government circles to offend the Muslim community. Ministers go out of their way to say the letter was written in a deliberately respectful, conciliatory, emollient tone. It says that British values Muslim values. But at the same time, equally clearly it has caused offence. Some within the Muslim immunity question why they are being singled out. Why hasn’t a letter been sent to other religious communities who also have a role in countering extremism? They question why they are asked to act as government mouthpieces. They question why they are being told to do more, implying they are not doing enough. They question why this has been sent to mosques when they say the problem is online. The real danger, I think, the problem is online. The real danger, Ithink, is danger, I think, is that it fuels resistance and resentment in the Muslim unity. This whole saga tells us a number of things. -- Muslim unity. This whole saga tells us a number of things. -- Muslim community. Firstly, just how sensitive and delicate relations with some sections of the Muslim community now, and secondly, how reliant ministers are an Muslim leaders in leading this fight. They know full well that young Muslims in danger of radicalisation are not going to listen to some minister doing a worthy interview on the Today programme. They will listen to people in their own communities. As I say at the moment, the danger is that we seem to have mutual incomprehension and misunderstanding on both sides, with potentially very dangerous consequences. Indeed, given how sensitive and delicate this issue is, is there a sense that the hype there might have been a bit more consultation with the leaders of Islam in this country? That will be the accusation. My feeling is that ministers took the decision to write directly to the mosques and the imams because they wanted to bypass some of the umbrella representative organisations, who they see as sometimes more resistant to the message they are getting over, whereas perhaps at a local level, and ministers take the view it is at a local level where the problem of radicalisation will be confronted, perhaps Muslim leaders are more receptive to this message. Thank you forjoining us. British Gas, the UK’s biggest domestic energy supplier, is cutting household gas prices by 5%. That would reduce a typical household’s annual energy bill by £37. The company says the reduction reflected the recent fall in wholesale gas prices, and comes after its rival E.ON cut prices by 3.5% last week. Here’s our personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz. The pressure has told on British Gas from months of plunging worldwide energy prices. Gas prices for customers, not electricity, go down by 5%. That means £37 of the average bill and 6.8 million customers will benefit. But why have they had to wait so long? Much of the gas being used today will have been bought well in advance, months or even years. Perhaps at higher prices. It does take time for the gradual effect of the wholesale price falling to come through. By some measures, the wholesale price of gas is down by more than 25%. Yet even a 5% cut for British Gas households will take longer to feed through. With temperatures struggling to get into positive territory, even in London, reduce gas has chosen the coldest spell of the winter so far to announce its price cut will stop however, it is not implemented until the end of February. Customers still have nearly six weeks of winter to endure before they start paying less. British Gas’ move comes after E.ON brought in a smaller 3.5% reduction but applied it immediately. The speed of suppliers passing on lower prices is being looked at by the competition and markets authority. Every little helps consumers at a time when they are really struggling with energy bills. But this is a modest price cut in response to seismic faults in wholesale energy prices. We really need to single competition authority looking at this issue and making sure that wholesale prices are being passed through fairly. -- sure that wholesale prices are being passed through fairly. -- see the competition authority. There has been a clamour of calls for lower energy bills from political parties and consumer groups. Now they will turn to the other major suppliers to announce cuts as well. Extremists from the Nigerian Islamist group, Boko Haram have released some of the dozens of hostages captured yesterday from neighbouring Cameroon, after being pursued by the army. Most of those kidnapped are women and children. The Islamists have murdered thousands in the last year, as they try to carve out territory in northern Nigeria, to be governed under strict Sharia law. Boko Haram is now said to control an area roughly the size of Belgium. Our world affairs correspondent Emily Buchanan has the story. The fightback against Boko Haram. Armoured vehicles, helicopters and around 2000 soldiers from Chad mobilised. One of the region’s best militaries, going to protect neighbouring Cameroon. Chad’s president explained by his country was getting involved. TRANSLATION: To help both Cameroon and Nigeria face the situation. There are men, women and children dying. We can’t remain indifferent to what is happening. That is why we are sending soldiers. When the BBC recently visited border villages in northern Cameroon, civilians were terrified. Many had already fled. Cameroon’s army had lost dozens of men. Now in their biggest attack yet, Boko Haram has abducted dozens of Boko Haram has abducted 80 women and children from this area. The Cameron Army has managed to rescue two dozen of them. Young girls have already been the militants’ target. Over the border in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram seized 200 girls from a school last April. The militants have been accelerating their advance in Nigeria. They overran a military post and the town of Baga. Satellite pictures showed the extent of the destruction. And over the weekend, a suicide bomber killed four people and injured many others at a bus station. Thousands have fled the violence. There are presidential elections next month. These people, who would have been likely to vote against the president, have now lost their right to vote as well as their homes and livelihoods. TRANSLATION: When they attacked my village, they killed the men and told the women they were going to convert us. Iran and ran. I stayed in the bush for three days with no food or water. I came here with nothing, just myself. This is a Boko Haram promotional video. There’s huge disappointment with the government for being slow or unwilling to clamp down on the group. It may now be neighbouring countries that will have to galvanise the forces to stop the advance. The Government says the NHS in England needs to do more to cut the numbers of suicides every year. The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says many are preventable, and he wants health services to work towards ending all such deaths. Around 4,700 people took their own lives in England in 2013, a rise of more than 6% on the previous year. Here’s our social affairs correspondent, Michael Buchanan. Nick Clegg with eight to be a subject which is costing lives. He wants the NHS to take the lead in changing attitudes. Medics come he says, should commit to drastically reducing the number of people who kill themselves. This is not about blame. It is about doing more in every area of our society to ensure that people don’t get to that point where they believe taking their life is their only option. This includes in our health system. This NHS Trust in Liverpool is embarking on a two-year programme to save lives. Suicide prevention teams will be created and patients will be offered better psychiatric help more quickly. We know there things we can do to prevent suicide and change the way we make services and change the way we design and to provide people with much safer and more effective types of therapy. We think we can stop suicides. This American hospital actually stopped all suicides among his patients by retraining staff, making it easier for Beagle to seek help as well as educating and supporting their families. None of its patients with depression killed themselves from more than two years. There have been times when I’ve actively try to take mY times when I’ve actively try to take my own life. Such intensive care from doctors also saved Iris, who has made several suicide attempts. There have been times when I’ve given up on myself but they have been there for me. They have supported me when I have been difficult. I am very difficult to nurse because when I’m well, I am a child in a big person’s body and it is hard to deal with. The ambition to reduce suicides has been broadly welcomed by charities have questioned how achievable it is with mental health beds and budgets being cut. Labour says the priority should be stopping people cut-- becoming unwell in the first place as Ed Miliband launched their mental health strategy today. It is just after 1:15pm. health strategy today.

There’s increasing political pressure on rail bosses over delays and cancellations troubling the commuters. A chilly day for the capital. Will temperatures drop still further? We’ll have a full forecast. Thousands of homes in Northern Ireland are without water because of industrial action by the local supplier. Engineers at Northern Ireland Water are refusing to do out-of-hours repairs because of changes to their pensions. Here’s Andy Martin. There is still snow on the ground in many areas across Northern Ireland and it isjust as well. Some have resorted to melting it for cooking, washing and other everyday tasks. No water to flush toilets. Nothing to do washing-up. You never miss the water until the well runs dry. We are down to boiling snow. Since the dispute began over Christmas an estimated 25,000 people, 10,000 homes and businesses, have had to do without. We have turned away bookings because we have no water facilities. In terms of hygiene in the toilets, we cannot flush the toilets, staff cannot wash their hands. This is not a strike and Northern Ireland Water, the only provider in the country, is not a private company. Staff members are refusing to work outside their normal hours in a dispute over a proposed hike in their pension contributions. They have already put up with pay restraint, they have already improved productivity. They have cut down on bills to business customers and they are saying they are not prepared to have pensions cut. Northern Ireland Water disputes the unions’ estimate that some workers will be £100 worse off every month. Ultimately the Stormont executive controls its budget and so the company says it is obliged to honour public sector pension reforms which are being implemented across the UK. Managers in the water treatment works trying to get it restarted, unfortunately that has not been successful. We have customers supplied today. The situation could get worse. Northern Ireland water says a proposal put forward last week represents its best offer. Unions insist that amounts to a pay cut. Negotiations will resume this afternoon but in an increasingly fractious dispute it is the elderly, some of whom have been left without heating, and those with young families, who are faring worse. Kenyan police have fired tear gas at pupils at a school in Nairobi who were protesting about the sale of their playground to a private developer. The school has about 1,000 children between the ages of three and 14 and is run by Nairobi City Council. Ed Thomas reports. It is the primary school protest. Children as young as seven holding branches. Beyond the gate, what their maxi is their playground. Within minutes, the walls keeping them out are torn down. Then, the patience of the riot police runs out. Tear gas rises up, smothering the protesters and the children. When they saw us they started to throw the tear gas. The police? Yes. The police were chasing us. Could you believe the police would do that to children? No, I did not believe. There is calm at the Mormon but an uneasy stand-off between the pupils, parents and teachers. If you look alongside the wall that was built here at over Christmas, you can see the riot police with batons and shields. The problem is what Kenyans call land grabbing. The playground has been bought by a private company. The school says it is theirs and wants it back. Have your children always played on that field? Yes. Police said there, they word here to keep the peace, but there is anger that tear gas was brought to a primary school. Disappointed at what the police are doing. This dispute will be settled by the government. Campaigners say they will make sure the children get their land back. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, says victims and witnesses should be warned when they’re likely to be questioned about their sexual history or bad character in criminal trials. The proposed guidance would allow prosecution witnesses in England and Wales to be given more information about the defence case before a trial begins, but critics warn that that this would lead to witnesses being coached, which isn’t allowed. Our home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw reports. Giving evidence in court was more than Frances Andrade could bear. A week after testifying about being sexually abused, the 48-year-old concert violinist took an overdose and died. New guidelines have been proposed to prepare people for the rigours of the courtroom. Prosecution witnesses will be informed before trial what the defence case is. They will be warned if there are likely to be questions about their sexual history and told if their medical records or other personal information may be used in court. Very often when I have spoken to victims and witnesses over my career as a prosecutor they have been anxious about giving evidence, so this is about helping them and making sure we address some of their concerns. Under the plans courtroom procedures and rules will also be explained before people go in the witness box. Victims welcome the idea. This woman gave evidence at a rape trial. Unless you have been the victim of a crime and you have had to go to court you will not understand how distressing it is. Nobody should be put in that position but if you are you should at least know what you’re up against. The proposals are radical and not without controversy. Some lawyers are concerned they will lead to prosecution witnesses being coached in their evidence, a practice that is not allowed, and if that happens it could lead to more cases ending up here at the Court of Appeal. It is absolutely vital that witnesses are made to feel at ease, and that applies to both prosecution and defence. There are dangers which may lead to injustice. The planned reforms come too late for Frances Andrade, but they might lessen the ordeal for other victims. Oxfam says the wealthiest 1% will soon own more than the rest of the world’s population. Research by the charity shows that the share of the world’s wealth owned by the richest 1% increased from 44% in 2009 to 48% last year. Oxfam hopes its research will increase pressure on global leaders to tackle wealth inequality when they meet at this week’s World Economic Forum. The parents of a five year-old boy from Cornwall have been sent a bill because he failed to turn up to a friend’s birthday party. Alex Nash from Cornwall had been invited to go to a dry ski slope, but had to pull out when his parents realised they’d double booked. However, the birthday boy’s mother, julie Lawrence, was left out of pocket and billed Alex for £15.95. Our correspondent is at the ski centre in Plymouth. It was here that the party took place just before Christmas. Five-year-old Alex was invited along with some of his classmates to celebrate his friend Ed Balls birthday. They were down here to do some playing on the slopes -- his friend’s birthday. His dad says that they did not have any way of getting in contact with the birthday boy’s family and did not think any more about it. When the schools went back, they had a surprise. My partner looked in his schoolbag and found an envelope in there, so she had opened it and she brought it up to me, and it was an invoice for a child no-show for the party and she wanted £15.95. It was a proper invoice with details, even bank details, and her address and name and everything and telephone number. The birthday boy’s mother said that... The claimed to be interviewed by the BBC. She said she had been left out of pocket -- declined. She said details were on the invitation to get in touch with her.

British Gas becomes the latest energy supplier to cut its prices after the big fall in wholesale costs. Its gas prices will drop by 5%, but not until the end of next month. Well, it’s nice that they’re cutting the prices but it’s just very annoying that they’re waiting until the end of winter to actually allow the customers to benefit from it. We’ll be asking whether energy suppliers could be doing more to cut prices.

British Gas, the UK’s biggest domestic energy supplier, has announced a cut in its household gas prices in direct response to the fall in wholesale energy costs. They’ll come down by 5% but not until February the 27th. The company said the cut would reduce the typical household’s annual energy bill by £37. But electricity prices remain the same. British Gas is the second major supplier to take action. E.ON lowered its prices last week. But consumer groups said the move was only modest compared with the big drop in wholesale costs. Here’s our Industry Correspondent, john Moylan. Temperatures have been plummeting, it is the coldest spell this winter. As households turn up the heating, many will be worried about their bills so they have welcomed the news British Gas is reducing its prices in response to falling wholesale costs. We buy a lot of gas in advance, some of it will have been bought months ago even years ago at higher prices. But it is not soon enough for British Gas customer julie Harding from Manchester. She recently lost herjob and can now only afford to put her heating on for half an hour twice a day. When I first saw the headline I thought fantastic, they are juicing first saw the headline I thought fantastic, they arejuicing it fantastic, they are juicing it by 5%, betterthan E.ON, and fantastic, they are juicing it by 5%, better than E.ON, and then I realised it was not going to be for another month and a half and I felt cheated. It doesn’t seem fair they are holding onto the money for as long as they can before passing the cuts on to the customers. Like E.ON, British Gas is cutting tariffs because wholesale gas prices have been tumbling, down around 30% over the past year. But British Gas says as it buys gas in advance, its costs haven’t fallen as dramatically. Gas itself only accounts for around half of the typical bill and the company insists that the price of other elements like getting energy to our homes and those government green levies have been going up. That said, some believe British Gas could have done more. I think the reductions are fairly modest given the massive drop in wholesale oil prices. I think you could probably justify a bigger decrease in price to the customers, perhaps 10%. But the move put energy back in the political spotlight, Ed Miliband said it was too little too late. The right way forward on this is the energy freeze which means prices can only fall and not rise, and giving the regulator the power to cut prices when the drop does not get passed on. This fall will not be happening if we had listened to Labour and put into place their price freeze. Whether the big suppliers pass on falls in wholesale costs is at the heart of an ongoing investigation into the industry, but with winter truly upon us, this Court by British Gas will heap the pressure on its rivals to follow sooner rather than later. Our Deputy Political editorjames Landale is in Westminster now. james, price cuts don’tjust affect households nowadays, they’ve become a big political issue too? Everything is political these days and there is little more political than the cost of living. All sides have welcomed the price cut but disagreed over who should claim the credit and what should happen now. Labour say it is wrong to wait for the companies to hand over the price cuts, instead you should have a regulator that forces them. The Conservatives say you need more political pressure on these companies. The Conservatives also claimed British Gas would not be able to pass on this price cut if Labour’s energy Labour said that was nonsense, there freeze was always a cap and would allow for falling freeze was always a cap and would allow forfalling prices. The bottom line is some energy prices are falling while inflation is falling and real wages are beginning to pick UP and real wages are beginning to pick up and that can only make it harder for Labour to place the cost of living at the heart of their election campaign and only make it easierfor the election campaign and only make it easier for the Conservatives who are hoping to generate some economic confidence ahead of the general election. The Prime Minister has defended a letter from the Government urging Muslim leaders to explain more clearly what it means to be a Muslim in Britain. He said anyone who had a problem with it had a problem themselves. But the Muslim Council of Britain says the letter, written in the wake of the Paris attacks, ""feeds into an Islamophobic narrative"". This report from our special correspondent Lucy Manning. just what is the problem? Is it British Muslims who are being asked to do more to tackle extremism, or government ministers who are suggesting Muslims must demonstrate their British identity? Ministers wrote to more than 1000 mosques and imams praising their response to the Paris attacks but asking them to do more. Part of the letter said you as Faith leaders are in a unique position in our society. You have a precious opportunity and an important responsibility in explaining and demonstrating how faith in Islam can be part of British identity. The Muslim Council of Britain says it is an offensive letter that assumes, as the far right does, that Muslims are not part of British society. It is almost challenging the view that Muslims in Britain who have been here for decades now are not doing the right thing, so when does a government minister lecture the community as a whole? We don’t see letters going to church leaders for example, saying we need to stop the EDL. After the attacks in Paris, the letter says there is more work to do on extremism but said British values were Muslim values. The Prime Minister quite clear what the problem is. Anyone, frankly, reading this letter who has a problem with it I think really has a problem because it is the most reasonable, sensible, moderate letter that Eric could have possibly written. Frankly, all of us have a responsibility to try to confront this radicalisation. In the mosques of Bradford, an acceptance that should help prevent radicalisation but some unhappy at the tone of the letter. A big responsibility lies on the Government. This letter you are referring to, it is almost segregating us. I think the letter which was sent is good, and should help them. They are helping them. I think it is a good idea to ask mosques because, you know, it is children who go there so imams can help. There has been a problem in the past with young British Muslims being radicalised at some mosques but the situation now is somewhat different. Many of those going to Syria have been radicalised by what they have seen and preachers they have heard online, and British imams have been unable to stop them. And there is some religious agreement, even the former chief rabbi said radical Islam is a global movement so it was unsurprising for British Muslims to say this isn’t under our control. The former pop star Gary Glitter has appeared in court, accused of a string of historic sex offences against three girls. The 70-year-old, whose real name is Paul Gadd, is on trial for 10 charges relating to alleged crimes committed in the 1970s and 1980. Daniela Relph is at Southwark Crown Court. It was one of the most famous faces of the 1970s, but Gary Glitter ‘s days of pop stardom are behind him. Today he was here to deny charges relating to the sexual abuse of young girls. The report contains flashing images. There remains a hint of flamboyance in the arrival of Gary Glitter but here he is known by his real name, Paul Gadd. He is facing ten historical charges relating to the sexual abuse of young girls. One of the allegations came at the height of his fame, at his peak when he was enjoying the wealth his music career brought him. The prosecution allege in April 1975 he attempted to rape an eight-year-old girl. Prosecuting john Price OC told jurors: The court heard that the woman only told police about the incident 23 years later, and Paul Gadd was arrested on suspicion of having child pornography. The prosecution said there were two other alleged victims in the case, both had been assaulted at his concerts. The former Glam rock star denies all of the charges against him. The trial is due to last about three weeks. The Nigerian Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has kidnapped 80 people from a village in neighbouring Cameroon, many of them are children. It is one of its biggest abductions outside Nigeria and raises fears that Boko Haram is expanding its attacks. The authorities in Cameroon say 24 hostages were rescued, but the rest were taken by Boko Haram to their camps in north-eastern Nigeria. Our Nigeria correspondent Will Ross reports. These are the jihadist fighters of Boko Haram. Forthe These are the jihadist fighters of Boko Haram. For the last five years they have waged a brutal campaign of violence in north-east Nigeria but now they have stepped up attacks in Cameroon. Overthe now they have stepped up attacks in Cameroon. Over the weekend they kidnapped dozens of men, women and children. They came there by surprise, as usual. They exercised violence, they burned almost 80 houses, they killed three people... This conflict is spreading fear way beyond the borders of Nigeria. Arrayed in the Moloko area is the latest in a string of attacks. Those fleeing Baga say hundreds of civilians have been killed.

Thousands of homes in Northern Ireland have been without running water and central heating because of an industrial dispute. Union members at Northern Ireland Water are refusing to do out of hours repairs or work overtime in protest at changes to their pensions. In some places Red Cross volunteers have been deployed to help desperate householders. From Belfast, Andy Martin reports. If it had not been for the snow, this woman would not have been able to wash all weekend. After four days without, her supply was restored this morning. But she does not know how long it will last. They have not told me exactly Wesley Ward is going to stay on. They don’t know. It is on here but it is somewhere else. Since the dispute began over Christmas, an estimated 25,000 people and as many as 10,000 businesses and homes have had to go without. Forthose businesses and homes have had to go without. For those living in rural areas like this, their only means of getting water is through browsers delivered by the water service. Northern Ireland Water is publicly owned and the only provider in the country. Staff members are not on strike but are refusing to work extra hours because of a proposed hike in their pension contributions. Unions claim it could leave them £100 worse off every month. They have already put up with PGY month. They have already put up with pay restraint and improve productivity. They have cut down on bills to business customers. They are saying they are not prepared to have their pensions cut. But ultimately, the Stormont executive wants Northern Ireland Water to implement public sector pension reforms being enacted in other parts of the UK. Tonight, the company’s Management team acknowledged the inconvenience caused by what, for some, has been five days without water. I would say to consumers, I apologise for the interruption in service. I will be working very hard with my management team to make sure you don’t experience any further supply interruptions. I would appeal to the unions to put in place measures to protect the public water drinking supply. This evening, the unions put forward a new proposal and while more homes are being reconnected, it has been the elderly, some of whom have been left without central heating, and those with young families who have fared worst. It isjust after 6:15pm. Our top story this evening: Britain’s biggest energy supplier, British Gas is to cut its gas prices by 5% after the big fall in wholesale costs.

Tesco - it was one of the great success stories of the past decade, but it’s run into some trouble. Now its former chief executive, Sir Terry Leahy - the man credited with building the supermarket giant has accused Tesco of eroding the trust of its millions of customers. The supermarket has suffered from falling sales and is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over an accounting scandal. Sir Terry has been speaking exclusively to our business editor Kamal Ahmed, for BBC Panorama. Its size is dizzying. Britain’s biggest retailer has fallen on tough times with falling sales and falling profits. All the challenges of the recession... Today, the man largely credited with building the business broke his silence on what has gone wrong at Tesco. He told the BBC the supermarket had lost the trust of its customers and had lost its reputation on price. It is very damaging. Tesco is the biggest and people expect it to have the best prices for the products they buy. They should know they can trust Tesco to deliver that are not have to shop around and check they are getting the best deal. I think some of that trust has been eroded. He said there had been failures at the very top, including with his successor, Philip Clarke. When you are the chief executive, if it goes well, you get credit and if it does not, you must take responsibility. Philip Clarke has taken the responsibility and paid the price with hisjob. Mr Clarke resigned last year. He said he had to change the business because of problems that had built up over many years. The BBC has heard allegations that suppliers fell out with Tesco over sums paid to the supermarket for things like increased prominence on its shelves. As sales fell on profit warning followed profit warning, we have discovered Tesco put ever-increasing pressure on its suppliers for higher fees. It was not afraid to take on the biggest names in the business. I am the science. This French cosmetics giant disputed a £1 million payment to Tesco in 2013 and threatened legal action, saying it would stop supplying them. Tesco said the battle had been resolved. The relationship between retailers and suppliers is policed by the groceries code adjudicator. She told me she has no powers to fine supermarkets, despite applying for them over a supermarkets, despite applying for them overa year them over a year ago. The fact is, a year later, you can’t find a retailer as we sit here at the moment. -- retailer as we sit here at the moment. -- you cannot find them. As we city, I can’t, I have the legal powers to do so but I can’t have a maximum. There is no figure. The Business Secretary said he backed the adjudicator having the power to impose fines but said the government was split. It is a straightforward political disagreement. It should have happened, Ithink political disagreement. It should have happened, I think it should happen. But my Conservative colleagues in government have not been willing to agree. We have not been able to make progress. The Treasury said it was working through theissue Treasury said it was working through the issue but whether the adjudicator gets the power to impose fines or not, Tesco is now focused on getting customers back through the door. Sir Terry Leahy said if it gets it right, Tesco can once again be the place Britain lost to shop. -- loves to shop. And you can see more on that story on BBC Panorama’s Trouble At Tesco. That’s on BBC One at 8:30pm. Britain’s first female genital mutilation trial has got under way. A doctor at the Whittington Hospital in North London has pleaded not guilty to carrying out the procedure on a woman after she had given birth just over two years ago. These are the first charges brought under the landmark Female Genital Mutilation Act, asjune Kelly reports. You may find some of the details of her report distressing. Doctor Dharmasena, Doctor Dharmase na, a hospital registrar, who is now a defendant in this unprecedented criminal case. He stands accused of harming one of the patient in his care by mutilating her genital area. He is pleading not guilty. On trial with him, A1 your old Hassan Mohammed, facing charges of encouraging and abetting female genital mutilation. He denied everything. Female genital mutilation, or FGM, is practised in some communities from Africa and the Middle East. It is part of their culture. It has been illegal in the UK for 30 years. This is the first time anyone in this country has been prosecuted for it. Opening the case, the prosecutor told Southwark Crown Court, ""FGM can be very dangerous for a woman’s health and psychological well- being. It can lead to severe health problems and in some cases, death"". The trial centres on a woman who gave birth at the Whittington Hospital in north London. She had undergone FGM when she was six. Her identity is not being disclosed. The court heard that before the birth, the doctor had to reverse the damage already done by FGM. But afterwards it is alleged Dr Dharmasena performed a procedure on her which was the same as the original FGM. He is said to have acted with the encouragement of his co-defendant, Hassan Mohammed. The jury was told that a midwife saw what the doctor had done and told him it was illegal. Dr Dharmasena then got in touch with an on-call consultant. The consultant is said to have been of the opinion that it would have been painful and humiliating for the work the doctor had carried out to be reversed. The court will hear from some of the Doctor’s colleagues and other medical experts. It was one of the major engagements of the First World War. More than 500,000 Allied troops fought in the Battle for Gallipoli in 1915. Now their descendants are being asked to come forward for a commemoration service in London this year to mark the centenary. Robert Hall, who’s at the London Imperial War Museum can tell us more. Gallipoli was one of Britain’s most disastrous military adventures. What was it all about? It was all about taking on Turkey and perhaps most importantly, seizing the Dardanelles Strait. Here they are between the two parts of Turkey. They wanted to take Constantinople as well, now Istanbul. Nigel Steele from the Imperial War Museum is here. Istanbul. Nigel Steele from the ImperialWar Museum is here. Why Imperial War Museum is here. Why was it such a disaster? There was no clear plan. Everything seemed to evolve forward. A classic example of mission creep. No one is sure what they were trying to do each stage. Once they landed, the campaign rolled further and further into a quagmire and frustration. Terrible conditions. Nothing went right until the very end. Terrible loss of life. Yes and it was a shock for Britain because it was so early in the war. Know that he was prepared for the nature of this industrialised warfare. Ipso today is about remembrance and families connecting. Paddyjackson has got a connection. Tell me about that. This is my grandfather. At 16, he was a merchantman serving on HMS Vengeance, certainly in the early part of the Dardanelles campaign and later supporting the land elements. You have done so much work yourself, on the table here. You have work to get a connection. How important is it other people on to the call and attend events in April? If you don’t know what your forebears did, try to find out. We don’t have anyone who was there at the time but we are a direct link to those people. Find out what they did and then come and visit the Senate after on April 25. Thank you forjoining us. -- the Cenotaph will stop perhaps it is a way for families to make a connection with the men who are lying so many miles away, and perhaps understand a little of what they went through. Five-year-old Alex Nash was invited to a school friend’s birthday party in Plymouthjust before Christmas, but at the last minute he didn’t go. Now his parents have been sent a bill for nearly £16 by the other child’s mother because the five year-old didn’t turn up. From Plymouth, jon Kay reports. Most kids get a party bag. Alex Nash got a bill. He did not turn up at his friend’s party. Alex’s dad could not believe it when he opened the five-year-old’s schoolbag and found an invoice from the birthday boy’s family, the £15.95. It was a proper invoice with official beta else, even her bank details, her e-mail address and name and telephone number. The party was here at Plymouth’s dry ski slope. The venue said the invoice was nothing to do with them, and was a private matter between the two families. So what went wrong? Alex’s dad said he accepted the party invitation without realising it clashed with a family event so his son did not go. But that meant the family of the birthday boy had to pay for a place which was not used. So they sent a bill. What happened here at five-year-old’s birthday party has snowballed, with thousands of parents discussing it online all over the world. Some of them say it was wrong to send an invoice to five-year-old Alex. Others say fair enough. It isjust five-year-old Alex. Others say fair enough. It is just good enough. It isjust good manners if you are not showing up to something, you should make every effort to let people know, otherwise you are letting people down. But then again, five-year-olds are quite capricious. They could be ill at any time. Maybe everybody needs to calm down a bit. Derek says he tried to warn the other family that Alex would not be at the party but did not have their number. They don’t want to speak publicly tonight, but in a statement, they told the BBC that all their contact details were on the original invitation, so cancelling would have been easy. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Darren Bett. Very cold at the moment but will it continue? Really cold to night and it is going to continue. The next few days are going to be pretty cold out there. More widespread frost and icy conditions and for some, sleet and snow as well. Changes are slow but they are coming in from the Atlantic, a belt of cloud bringing some rain, sleet and snow tonight into Northern Ireland. Mostly snow in the West and widespread ice. Showers in western and eastern coasts, the cloud breaking up in eastern England and freezing fog patches but a widespread frost in towns and cities. In the countryside, minus five degrees or lower, possibly -14 over the snowfields of Scotland. It will turn particularly icy in Scotland on Tuesday as the mixture of rain, sleet and snow moves in. Northern Ireland brightening up with the cloud coming into western parts of England and Wales. Fine and dry in the East. Sunshine at times in the south-west and mostly dry across Wales. Much more cloud, a bit of rain and sleet not far from the West Coast. Midlands and eastern England likely to be dry in most places but cold with temperatures only a few degrees above freezing but some sunshine. Northern Ireland will have sunshine after an icy start with wintry showers. Most of the sleet and snow pushing into Scotland, particularly over the hills. Could be quite a bit of snow by the end of the day, affecting the A9. Very messy tomorrow evening and tomorrow night. A mixture of rain, sleet and snow eases eastwards across England and Wales. Overnight, snow in the Midlands and the North but as we go into Wednesday, we could see some sleet and snow across the south-east, slowly petering out through the day. Further west, wintry showers knocking about on Wednesday. Some sunshine perhaps and the best of it in the south-west but another cold day. As we head into Thursday, not much sunshine but most places will be dry and cloudy and again cold. Tonight on BBC London News: A millionaire Harley Street doctor is suspended for a year, after this programme caught him training nurses to obtain Botox illegally. He’s incredibly manipulative. Someone who can make hundreds and hundreds of nurses believe a pack of lies. The doctors’ watchdog says he’s not fit to practise and could put patients at risk. We’ve a special report.

Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. He boasted of running one of the largest cosmetic surgery businesses in Europe, from his offices in Harley Street. But tonight, Dr Mark Harrison has been banned from the medical profession for a year for a series of offences, including training nurses to obtain the drug Botox illegally. The panel which disciplines doctors said he was unfit to practise and described his conduct as ""deplorable"". The case was brought after BBC London exposed his techniques in an undercover investigation. Alex Bushill has this exclusive report. Dr Mark Harrison had hundreds of nurses working with him, making millions of pounds. But did he put profit before his patients? During the seven years that Dr Harrison ran his remote prescribing business from here in the heart of Harley Street, he amassed a fortune, but at what price? We now know that the millionaire doctor endangered his patients’ safety and the business model was based on an illegal practice. This is how Botox should be administered cosmetically, after a face-to-face consultation with a doctor. They then issue a prescription. If they’re not taking aspirin, Stjohn’s wort or fish oils... This is how Dr Harrison did it- over the phone. Tens of thousands of times. Have you read and signed the consent form? At the end of the line, a client and a nurse. He charges for the call. When we sent our own nurse in to secretly film him, the rules stated that remote prescribing should only be done in exceptional circumstances, as Botox is a toxin and paralysing agent. Patients can be allergic, go into shock or be infected, which is why face-to-face consultations are needed. Safeguards Dr Harrison ignored. Worse still, he flouted rules that prevent the misuse of prescribed drugs, prescribing against one person’s name in order to treat another. And if you can’t reach him on the phone, he said his nurses could carry out Botox injections, a prescription drug, without authorisation. We put him to the test, claiming we’d already injected a first-time patient. He then didn’t speak to our patient and left a message instead. He even made this prophetic remark about the risks he was running. I have to speak to every patient, otherwise the GMC could be kicking me out. And sure enough, today he was suspended for a further 12 months, as a panel from the Medical Practitioners’ So, why did he break the rules? Well, it’s certainly earned him a fortune. He boasted in his own newsletter that he carried out 50,000 remote prescriptions. At £30 a go, it means he made £1.5 million from the phone calls alone. ",,

On BBC London: A Harley Street doctor is suspended for ‘deplorable’ conduct after an investigation by this programme. And the mother of Breck Bednar criticises Surrey Police for missing allegations against his killer. Good evening. Eye-witnesses in Nigeria have been describing the destruction and loss of life in the north-eastern region during attacks by the militants of Boko Haram. Hundreds of people have been killed in the past few weeks, and during the past 18 months the attacks are thought to have claimed more than 5,000 civilian lives. Some 750,000 people have been forced from their homes. One of the worst attacks was in the town of Baga two weeks ago. Our correspondent, Thomas Fessey, has tracked down some of those who managed to flee. What happened in the Nigerian town of Baga remains a mystery and trying to find out is a 15-hourjourney into the desert. We set off early on sandy tracks, drove through rivers and were carried across others by makeshift rafts. Finally, some of the thousands who fled Baga. We found seven-year-old Fatima on her own, inconsolable, calling for her father. When we met her mother in the camp, she told us of that day in Baga. ""My husband had gone to buy fish, when the attack began. Women later found his body floating in the lake, his hands tied, his throat cut."" She is now alone, forced to beg in a neighbouring village to feed her three small girls. Most of these women, children and men have lost relatives in the attack on Baga. They say Boko Haram fighters hunted them down as they ran into the bush. Whatever happened on the day of the attack in Baga, this is clear: there was absolute panic. People fled in all directions, families scattered, now separated, with no means of finding each other again. This 31-year-old man made it here alone. In the terrifying confusion, he lost sight of his wife and their baby. You don’t know whether they’re alive, yet? I don’t know. They all alive or some of them die, I don’t know. How do you feel about that? So, I’m angry. I’m so angry. Sad. I’m not feeling good. I cannot sleep in the night, if I went to my bedroom, so if I start sleeping, I cannot sleep. I am just thinking of them. Thinking about your family? Yes, yes, about my family. Aid agencies are starting to distribute kit. Everyone on this island arrived with nothing at all, not even a blanket. There have been claims that as many as 2,000 people were massacred in Baga. These counts were certainly overestimated, but Boko Haram have taken their fight across borders, and this Islamist insurrection looks more and more like a regional war. The extremists of Boko Haram have been developing more brutaltactics, including bombings in cities, destruction of rural communities, and assaults on military and police bases. Our Nigeria correspondent, Will Ross, looks at the difficulties encountered by the Nigerian Army as it struggles to stop the attacks. A show of strength by Nigerian soldiers, who here look well equipped and ready for action. For the past 18 months thousands of soldiers have been deployed to the northeast. The fight against Boko Haram has been a disaster. The jihadists have increased in strength and captured territory, often sending troops fleeing. I met some soldiers who were dismissed from the Army last week, after servingen the battlefront. They were accused of disobeying orders to fight. They said they were outgunned and at times their armoured vehicles ran out of fuel. The next thing you do isjust The next thing you do is just to abandon it. What happened to the vehicles? Boko Haram took all of it. Ifeel insulted, Ifeel vehicles? Boko Haram took all of it. I feel insulted, I feel embarrassed. I feel humiliated. I feel insulted, I feel embarrassed. Ifeel humiliated. In I feel humiliated. In their latest attack fighters crossed the border into Cameroon, where they abducted men, women and children. Some have been rescued by the military, but dozens were take into Nigeria, where the jihadist group is trying to establish an Islamic State. As the crisis deepens, some serious problems within the military have been exposed. This is no longer a problem just for this country. It is a regional one. The growing insecurity has prompted neighbouring Chad to deploy some 2,000 troops. It has one of the best equipped and trained armies in the region. The soldiers are in northern Cameroon, to bolster the fight against Boko Haram. But with concern in West Africa growing, Ghana’s President has called on Europe and the African Union to do more. I am encouraged by the news I received that Chad has moved troops into Cameroon. Terrorism, as we all know, affects the whole of the world. We cannot ignore terrorism in any part of the world. It has the tendency to grow like a cancer. Nigeria’s neighbours have long promised to work together against Boko Haram. But so far there’s been too little co-operation between the Armies and too much mistrust. That has played into the hands of the jihadists, whose brutal campaign of violence is spreading. British Gas, the UK’s biggest energy supplier is to cut its prices after weeks of pressure to pass on lower wholesale costs. The firm will reduce its gas prices by 5% from the end of February. It’s the second of the big six suppliers to take action. But consumer groups say it’s not enough, as our industry correspondent, john Moylan reports. Temperatures have been plummeting. It is the coldest spell this winter. As households turn up the heating many will worry about their energy bills. Foralmost many will worry about their energy bills. For almost seven million customers, some relief ahead, with the company cutting its gas tariff on the back of falling wholesale costs. We buy a lot in advance. Some would have been bought months or years ago. We wanted to pass on as much as we could, as quickly as we could. That is what we’re doing. It is not enough for this British Gas customer from Manchester. She recently lost customer from Manchester. She recently lost herjob and can now only afford to put her heating on for half an hour twice a day. When I saw the headline, I thought fantastic. They are reducing it by 5%. I arelised fantastic. They are reducing it by 5%. Iarelised it 5%. I arelised it would not be for another month-and-a-half and I felt cheated. It doesn’t seem fair they are holding on to the money for as long as they can before passing the cuts on to the customers. Like E.ON last week, British Gas can cut tariffs because wholesale gas prices have been tumbling. They are down around 30% over the past year. British Gas says as it buys gas in advance its costs have not fallen as dramatically. Gas itself only accounts for around half of a typical bill and the company insists the price of other elements, like getting energy to our homes and those Government green levy, well, they have been going up. Some still believe British Gas could have done more. ITIOFE. I more. I think these reductions are modest so far, given the massive drop in wholesale gas prices we have seen over the past year. I would have thought you could justify a bigger decrease - thought you could justify a bigger decrease - perhaps of the order of 10%. The move put energy back into the political spotlight. Ed Miliband said the cut was too little, too late. The right way forward on this is Labour’s energy price freeze, which will mean the prices can only fall and cannot rise and giving the regulator the power to cut prices when the changes do not get passed on. This price cut would not be happening if we listened to Labour and put in place their 2046 month price freeze. If we had frozen prices you would not have got their -- 20-month price freeze. If we had listened we would not have got this cut. With the winter truly upon us this cut by British Gas will heap the pressure on rivals to follow suit, sooner rather than later. The Prime Minister has defended an official letter sent to Britain’s mosques urging them to do more to combat extremism. David Cameron said it was both ""reasonable and sensible"" for his colleague, the Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles, to write the letter following the recent attacks in Paris. But some Muslim groups have reacted angrily, accusing ministers of creating new tensions between Muslims and other communities. Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, reports. So just what is the problem? Is it British Muslims, who are being asked to do more to tackle extremism or Government ministers, who are suggesting Muslims must demonstrate their British identity? Ministers wrote to more than a thousand mosques and imams praising their response to the Paris attacks but asking them to do more. Part of the letter said, ""You, as faith leaders, are in a unique position in our society. You have a precious opportunity and an important responsibility in explaining and demonstrating how faith in Islam can be part of British identity."" The Muslim Council of Britain, representing some Islamic organisations, says it’s an offensive letter that assumes Muslims aren’t part of British society. It’s almost challenging the view that Muslims in Britain, who have been here for decades now, are not doing the right thing. So when does a Government minister lecture the community as a whole? We don’t see letters going to, for example, church leaders to say you know, you need to stop the EDL or the far right in Britain. We don’t have that expectation. But the Prime Minister quite clearjust what the problem is. Anyone, frankly, reading this letter who has a problem with it I think really has a problem. I think it’s the most reasonable, sensible moderate letter that Eric could possibly have written. Frankly, all of us have a responsibility to confront this radicalisation. In the mosques of Bradford, an acceptance they should help prevent radicalisation. Some unhappy at the letter’s tone. A think responsibility does lie on the Government. I mean this letter that you’re referring to, it’s almost segregating us. I think it’s a good idea to ask mosques because it is our children go there, so you know, imams can help. There has been a problem in the past with young British Muslims being radicalised at some mosques, but the situation now is somewhat different. Many of those going to Syria have been radicalised by what they’ve seen and preachers they’ve heard online and, British imams have been unable to stop them. At this college in East London, they’re preparing the next generation of leaders. A lot is being done. We’ll go into the mosque and go into events that happen. A lot of this will be addressed. I’ve been given enough knowledge, enough of an understanding of my religion to understand that radicalisation isn’t a good thing. And there’s some religious agreement, even the former Chief Rabbi said radical Islam is a global movement, so it wasn’t surprising for British Muslims to say this isn’t under our control. The pop star, Gary Glitter, has gone on trial at Southwark Crown Court, accused of a string of sex offences against three young girls. The allegations include attempting to rape an eight-year-old child in the 1970s. The former singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, denies all ten charges, which date from between 1975 and 1980. A doctor has gone on trial accused of carrying out female genital mutilation on a woman who’d just given birth. Southwark Crown Court was told that Dhanuson Dharmasena performed the procedure - also known as FGM - at the Whittington Hospital in north London. It’s the first prosecution of its kind in the UK, as our correspondent, june Kelly, reports. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, a 32-year-old hospital registrar, who is now a defendant in this unprecedented criminal case. He stands accused of harming one of the patients in his care by mutilating her genital area. He is pleading not guilty. On trial with him is 41-year-old Hasan Mohammed. He is facing charges of encouraging and abetting female genital mutilation. He denies everything. Female genital mutilation, known as FGM, is practised in some communities of Africa and the Middle East. It is part of their culture. It has been illegal in the UK for 30 years, but this is the first time anyone in this country has been prosecuted for it. Opening the case, the prosecutor told Southwark Crown Court: This trial centres on a woman who gave birth in London. She had undergone FGM at the age of six. Her identity has not been disclosed. Before the birth, the doctor had to reverse the damage by FGM, but afterwards, it is alleged Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena performed a procedure on her which was the same as the original FGM. He is said to have acted with the encouragement of his co-defendant Hasan Mohammed. The jury was told a midwife saw what the doctor had done and told him it was illegal. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena then got in touch with an on-call consultant. The consultant is said to have been of the opinion that it would have been painful and humiliating for the work the doctor had carried out to be reversed. The court will hear from some of the doctor’s colleagues and other medical experts. Pope Francis has said that upholding Catholic teaching on birth control does not mean ""breeding like rabbits"". Speaking to reporters, on his way back to Rome, after a week-long visit to Asia, he urged Catholics to practise responsible parenting. Our religious affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, is in Rome. The language is striking. Does it signal a change of teaching? Well, even as he said it, on the plane, as we travelled back from Asia, Pope Francis said, ""Excuse my language"". I can’t remember another Pope who has talked about people not needing to breed like rabbits or have more children than was safe or responsible. It’s beginning to be typical of Pope Francis that he uses language on the surface which sounds liberal, even reformist, but the content of what he’s saying is actually simply a restatement of Catholic doctrine. He was asked by a journalist on the flight whether the Catholic Church’s teaching, the ban on artificial contraception was right, for places like the Philippines, where the Pope had met many street children, whose parents could not afford to feed or keep them. The Pope’s response was: The church’s teaching did not mean having more children than a family could deal with. It meant being responsible. So he hasn’t change the doctrine. He has not said it’s all right to use artificial birth control, but he has said families should not have more children than they can deal with. Thank you very much. The Chinese Premier, Li Keqiang, has warned that the national economy faces significant downward pressures this year. He was speaking on the eve of the publication of the latest economic data, expected to show that the country has grown at its weakest rate for nearly a quarter of a century. At its peak in 2007, the Chinese economy was enjoying annual growth of over 14%. But in 2014, the rate of growth is likely to have fallen to 7.3%. Our China editor, Carrie Gracie, went to the north-east city of Harbin, which is suffering many of the problems plaguing the world’s second largest economy. The law of gravity says that when the Sheng family go up, they must come down. But for the past three decades, the Chinese economy hasn’t lived by the law of gravity, which is why it’s called a miracle. A family day out at the ice festival. They have never had it so good. They expect the children’s lives to be better still. But beyond the winter wonderland, Harbin looks like this, a miracle economy in trouble. Enterprise choked by state factories, a real estate bubble, spiralling debt. If China doesn’t stop its risky habits, the economy may freeze all together. So it now has to take painful steps in the short-term for the sake of more sustainable growth in the future. The government has a slogan for this difficult exercise, it calls it the new normal. Part of this new normal is more private enterprise. When he’s not out with the family, Mr Sheng is in his shop selling prayer accessories for Buddhists. Religion is growing fast, especially among business people. A string of prayer beads can sell for up to £10,000. TRANSLATION: I like to spend more on buying better quality products. I’m confident this market is going to keep growing. After all, people think praying will help their business. And if things go well for me, I’ll move to a bigger shop. Dad has big dreams, but right now, mum is the main bread winner. She runs an elevator repair business, which has helped pay the extra costs of having two children in a country where you’re only supposed to have one. Slower growth has hit their income, but she says short-term pain is worth it for long-term gain. TRANSLATION: A slower economy is actually better for us because it’s steadier. Our generation is already so much better off than our parents’ and it’s going to be even betterfor our kids. It’s the quality of the growth that matters not the speed. China has got used to speed, slowing down and making space for the market is the promise now. But new direction, new danger. It’s a risky transition from fairy-tale to new normal. In Northern Ireland, around 4,500 properties remain without running water, as talks continue to end an industrial dispute. Some residents in remote areas have been without supplies for six days. Union members at Northern Ireland Water are refusing to do out-of-hours calls or work overtime in protest at changes to their pensions. Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco, has blamed a failure of leadership by his successors for the turmoil at the supermarket. Sir Terry told BBC Panorama that Tesco had allowed the trust of millions of customers to be eroded. Some of Tesco’s accounting procedures are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, as our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, reports. Its size is dizzying. Britain’s biggest retailer, which has fallen on tough times and falling profits. Today the man largely credited with building the business broke his silence on what has gone wrong at Tesco. He told the BBC the supermarket had lost the trust of its customers and had lost its reputation on price. It’s very damaging. Tesco’s the biggest. People expect it to have the best prices for the products that they buy and know they can trust Tesco to deliver that, not have to shop around and check they’re getting the best deal. Some of that trust has been eroded. He said the culture had changed since he left. And there had been failures at the very top, including his successor, Philip Clarke. When you’re the CEO, if it goes well, you get credit. If it doesn’t go well, you must take responsibility, and Phil Clarke has taken that responsibility and paid the price with hisjob. Mr Clarke, who resigned last year, said he had to change the business because of problems that had build up over many years. The BBC has heard allegations that suppliers fell out with Tesco’s over sums paid to the supermarket for things like increased prominence on its shelves. As sales fell and profit warning followed profit warning, we discovered Tesco put ever increasing pressure on suppliers for higher and higher fees. It wasn’t afraid to take on the biggest names in the business. Want an extraordinary natural looking hair colour? L’Oreal, the French cosmetics giant. It disputed a £1 million payment to Tesco in 2013 and threatened legal action, saying it would stop supplying them. Tesco said the battle had been resolved. You’re worth it. The relationship between retailers and suppliers is policed by the Groceries Code Adjudicator. She told me she has no powers to fine supermarkets despite applying for them over a year ago. The fact is, a year on, you’re not actually able to fine a retailer, as we sit here at the moment. As we sit here at the moment, I can’t fine retailers. I have the legal powers to do so, but I don’t have a maximum, therefore there’s no figure. The BBC has been told the Government is split and the decision delayed. But whether the adjudicator gets the power to fine or not, Tesco is now focussed on getting customers back through the door. Sir Terry said if it gets it right, Tesco can once again be the place Britain loves to shop. The actress, Anne Kirkbride, who played Deirdre Barlow in Coronation Street for 44 years, has died. Her husband said she passed away at a hospital in Manchester following a short illness. Deirdre Barlow was one of Coronation Street’s most popular characters. ITV said that Anne Kirkbride, who was 60, would be greatly missed. ITV’s director of television, Peter Fincham, said the actress had ""created a unique and unforgettable character"". The former European hurdles champion, Rhys Williams, says he should not have been suspended for having a banned substance in his system. He blamed the test result on a contaminated supplement. He and fellow Welshman Gareth Warburton were found to be at fault ornegligent in failing to check supplements they took in an energy drink, but they were cleared of knowingly cheating, and they’re now clear to compete again, as our correspondent, Andy Swiss, reports. He is one of Wales’ most famous athletes, but last summer, Rhys Williams faced his toughest hurdle yet. COMMENTATOR: He’s going to win the European title. He gets it. The 2012 European champion failed a drugs test on the eve of the Commonwealth Games too, instead of captaining his country, he was battling for his career. But now, he’s back. His positive test traced to a black occurrent energy drink -- positive test traced to a black occurrent energy drink -- occurrent energy -- occurrent energy drink -- occurrent energy -- currant energy drink. I should have received nothing because I’ve done nothing wrong. The only thing I could have done different is not take sup plements at all. If I didn’t take sup plements, I would be the only athlete in the world not taking supplements. My message is: If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. The company behind the supplements said: This episode has given the entire sport some food for thought. Sup plements -- sport some food for thought. Sup plements -- sup plements, like energy drinks are part of the sport. In a sport where every split second count, they help athletes perform at their peak. You can’t perform at the highest level with a nice Sunday dinner, especially with the jamaicans, Americans, Russians. You need protein powders and extra vitamins and minerals. The case of Williams and Gareth Warburton, seen here, suggest the reward of a supplement comes with a risk. They need to check carefully. And that they’re using one that’s been batch tested. Things can go wrong and it can be disastrous and very expensive. Williams says this saga has cost him £100,000. He’s proved he’s no indicate, but at some price -- he’s no cheat, but at some price. That’s all from us. Now it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Riz Lateef. A Harley Street doctor who boasted of running one of the largest cosmetic surgery businesses in Europe has been banned from the medical profession for a year for a series of offences, including training nurses to obtain the drug Botox illegally. The case against Dr Mark Harrison was brought after this programme exposed his techniques in an undercover investigation. Alex Bushill has this exclusive report. This is how Botox should be administered cosmetically - after a face-to-face consultation with a doctor, who then issues a prescription. This is how Dr Harrison did it- over the phone. Tens of thousands of times. At the end of the line a client and a nurse. He charges for the call. When we sent our own nurse in to secretly film him, the rules stated remote prescribing should only be done in exceptional circumstances, as Botox is a toxin and paralysing agent. Patients can be allergic, go into shock or be infected, which is why face-to-face consultations are needed. Safeguards Dr Harrison ignored. Worst still, he flouted rules which prevent the misuse prescribed drugs, prescribing against one person’s name in order to treat another. And if you cannot reach him on the phone, he said his nurses could carry out Botox injections, a prescription drug, without authorisation. We put him to the test, claiming we had already injected a first-time patient. He then didn’t speak to our patient and left a message instead. He even made this prophetic remark about the risks he was running. Otherwise the GMC could be kicking me out. Sure enough, today he was suspended for a further 12 months, a panel from the Medical Practitioners Tribunal service said: So, why did he break the rules? Well, it certainly earnt him a fortune. Infact, it amounted to a luxury lifestyle, with this six-bedroomed ",,

David Cameron and Prince Charles are among a number of world leaders and dignitaries who are travelling to Saudi Arabia to pay their respects following the death of King Abdullah. However some human rights groups have criticised the trip saying Western leaders should be condemning Saudi Arabia’s regime, rather than praising the late king. Our World Affairs Correspondent, jonny Dymond, reports ~ . One of the many coming to pay their respects. This is the prince of Morocco, coming to honour the king of the past and perhaps to catch the ear of the new Monarch. On his way, President Obama, who took off from India this morning but cutting that trip short to fly in and meet the new Saudi king on Tuesday. On his way, David Cameron, seen here in a previous visit with the former king. The Prime Minister is travelling with Prince Charles, a long time friend of the Saudi Royal Family. The new king of this hugely important country has declared that little will change. Human rights campaigners will be dismayed. But the Saudi Royal Family offers a defence. It has to do with our culture. It has to do with religion, it has to do with abiding what is taught in the schools. So it is really a tribal culture rather than a constitution or a political issue. At the Saudi air base all morning, the leaders kept coming. Iran is Saudis greatest regional rival but their Foreign Minister came to pay respects. This is part remembrance, part diplomatic event. At least 10 people have died and A6 are injured in Mariupol in Ukraine after a rocket attack, according to the Ukranian Interior Ministry. The strategic port town was attacked in the wake of Russian-backed rebels’ rejection of peace talks. NATO sources have told the BBC that there is also significant conflict near the two major cities of Luhantz, and Donestsk, with Pro-Russian rebels bolstered in the last few days by weapons and supplies from Russia itself. Our correspondent David Stern is in Kiev. This is the latest in a recent upsurge in violence in the region. Yes, and if it is an escalation, it is significant. As you said, both sides denied that they carried out what looks like a multiple missile attack. We can’t see exactly what is happening, if this is a widening of the conflict but it is significant. Mariupol is a strategic prize. It is a port on the south eastern coast. Up until now it has been under Government control. They have dug in there, the Government forces, along with volunteer battalions, in the expectation that perhaps the rebel forces would move to ta ke expectation that perhaps the rebel forces would move to take it but so far they have not. If they do this means that the front line is expanding more and it is anticipated that there could be a fierce fight indeed. Police in Gloucestershire have launched a murder inquiry after a the death of a man who was attacked with a machete. The 19-year-old was involved in a fight near the Pike and Musket pub in Tuffleyjust after midnight. Two other men, aged 18 and 22, were injured. Police are asking for any witnesses to come forward. The number of senior Army officers is likely to be cut as part of a major overhaul of its command structure. The review ordered by the head of the Army, General Sir Nick Carter, aims to make it more streamlined and more accountable. The Army currently has about 200 brigadiers and generals, but it is not yet clear how many roles will go. The Royal College of GPs is launching a new recruitment campaign to encourage more medical students to become family doctors - and to challenge what it calls outdated stereotypes. It’s warning that 10,000 new GPs will be needed in the next five years. Here’s our Health Correspondent jane Dreaper. Exciting and varied, this film talks about the range of GPs work. You can work in a prison, you can work in the military and travel the world, you can do anything you want, really, we all love ourjob. Only a fifth of trainee doctors choose to work as GPs, the Royal College has taken the unusual step of making this film to point out there is a good alternative to being a hospital doctor. We do find it really frustrating that so many of the images of doctors on medical school websites, on TV, are generally of people in scrubs with masks, obviously in a hospital setting. Actually, in general practice we deal with 90% of all contacts with the NHS and all human life is there. The Royal College has been campaigning for more investment to tackle GP shortages and it says the tide is now turning, more than £1 billion has been promised for primary care in England over the next four years. The Scottish Government is putting in an extra EAO million and primary care in Wales is getting another £10 million. Northern Ireland says it is recruiting enough GPs. Next week NHS England is expected to announce further measures to boost GP numbers, a new scheme will encourage family doctors to work part-time instead of retiring.

There is sunshine around with temperatures struggling. It’s a cold-feeling day. We are between the weather systems, the cloud gathering in the Atlantic to arrive tomorrow. There are showers in parts of Scotland. Wintry, a mixture of rain, sleet and snow. In the south, clear skies, giving sunshine in the rest of the afternoon. A touch colder in East Anglia, and parts of north-east England. Patchy cloud to produce one or two light showers. Much of Northern Ireland will be dry and bright through the afternoon. A few showers lasting into Scotland. The temperatures are about four to five Celsius. Clear skies at first, then the temperatures turning away to feel cold. In the early hours, the frost lasting in the south-eastern corner. In the west, more cloud arriving and the breeze to strengthen, patchy rain in the morning. A rather cloudy and damp start in Scotland and Northern Ireland. That moves to the south. After the cold bright start for the south-east, it becomes overcast but staying dry. There is rain arriving in the north-west corner with winds. The temperatures here 10 to 11 Celsius. A milder day for the western areas. Milder tomorrow if you are heading off to FA Cup matches.

The first Briton to be diagnosed with Ebola in the UK has been given the all clear and discharged from hospital. Nurse Pauline Cafferkey spent almost a month in a high level isolation unit and was in a critical condition for two weeks. Speaking exclusively to BBC News, she said that at one point she feared she might not survive. Our health correspondent, Branwenjeffreys, reports. It was the hope of saving lives that took Pauline Cafferkey to Sierra Leone, but after treating patients here, she returned infected with the virus that had killed so many. I get lots of nice letters and cards. Today, I met Pauline as she got ready to leave hospital in London. She saw the devastating impact of Ebola in Africa and remembered the terrifying moment she heard she was infected. I’d a lovely doctor with me who had the horrible job of breaking the bad news to me. She sat with me for a while. She did say to me, ""how do you feel?"" Ijust said, ""well, I’ve got a battle on my hands."" Which I did. Was there a point, for you, when you really thought you might not make it? There was a point, which I remember clearly saying - I don’t know which doctors were with me - but I do remember saying, ""that’s it, I’ve had enough."" It was this advanced isolation unit that gave Pauline a fighting chance. Intensive care, around the clock, and an experimental drug, flown in from Canada. What we used was an antiviral drug and also a blood product from someone who’s survived Ebola, to try and help herfight the illness. On Scotland’s flag, good wishes from the nurses on the unit. Pauline can’t remember all of her stay. She’s still reading through more than 100 letters and cards. I’m just a nurse, doing a job that I love, and these people that don’t know me are just writing to me. It’s things like, ""you don’t know me..."" Many nurses as well, which is nice. ""You make me proud to be a nurse."" Would you go back out to West Africa or to another similar situation again, having been through this once already? I would have to think seriously about it. Yeah. I’m definitely going to give aid work a break for a while. I just want to go back to my normaljob and normal life and I think my family will be happy with that as well. Pauline, you must be just so just incredibly relieved? I am very happy to be alive. Yep. Icertainly am. Pauline Cafferkey there, speaking to our health correspondent, Branwen jeffreys. The japanese government is trying to verify a video, apparently released bY so-called Islamic State, claiming the group has killed one of two japanese hostages.

More than 20 people have been killed and around Ao others wounded by rocket attacks in the port of Mariupol in Eastern Ukraine. A pro-Russian rebel leader says he launched the offensive.

David Cameron and the Prince of Wales have arrived in Saudi Arabia to pay their respects following the death of King Abdullah. They are among a number of world leaders travelling to the country. Some human rights groups have criticised the trip calling for condemnation of Saudi Arabia’s regime. Our world affairs correspondent, jonny Dymond’s report includes flash photography. That both Prince Charles and the Prime Minister should travel to Saudi Arabia is a reminder of how important the desert kingdom is to Britain. The two men came to Saudi Arabia to pay their respects, but they’ll want to build on a relationship stretching back decades. But Saudi’s poor human rights record has sparked claims of double standards. They should clearly say to the Saudis, these things are unacceptable. You’re part of the international community. You BFE S TT’IâTT’IbâI’. You are an ally. Therefore, you have to maintain a certain level of the most basic human rights in your country. Supporters of the UK’s Saudi relationship point first to the fact that the kingdom has the world’s largest oil reserves and with those reserves it can drive the price up or down. Then there’s counter terrorism. Governments of all stripes say we need the information and support that the Saudis can provide in and about the world’s most dangerous region. Finally, there’s trade. In 2012, Britain exported £7.5 billion worth of goods and services to the kingdom. Friends of the Saudis say the best way to get change on human rights is to work from the inside. I think if we are working with them, we certainly have far more leverage to be able to push them and to say, look, you needed to do more on human rights, civil liberties for people. President Obama will visit Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, cutting short his trip to India. It’s another sign of Saudi Arabia’s place in the global order. jonny Dymond, BBC News.

Protestors from the Occupy group have moved onto Parliament Square, in defiance of a law making it illegal to protest there. It comes as a legal case is being prepared, challenging the move by City Hall, which is responsible for the land. Gareth Furby reports. Parliament Square, the grass roped off and the area patrolled by police act and security staff. Ready to enforce by laws which say no protest can be held here without written permission. just down the road, t Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was happy with its protest location by the Ministry of Defence. Some people from the group Occupy, would rather have been on Parliament Square. It’s the most important place for protest because of its location. Last year, the Occupy group was prevented from setting up camp in the Square. What is happening now is a legal case is being prepared to challenge this. The actions of the Mayor and the police to prevent us examiner criesing our human rights to protest and free assembly is crucial in a democracy. The Greater London Authority says in order for Parliament Square to be enjoyed and protect the grass and historic infrastructure, by laws are in place requiring prior, written permission.

These ones on the platform are designed they create a vivid impression. Although these platform work are staying the loss of the Arches is a worrying trend. We will see the loss of a lot more works of arts and 20th Century buildings. There is not enough resources to listing buildings and working out which developers need to take care of. I’d like to see in the London the Mayor taking that on. The cinema in Soho is another potential loss, down to Crossrail 2. 20,000 have signed a petition objecting. London’s expansion means there are difficult choices. What we have to do is evaluate each one for the public good. How do we gain the best for the most people? And how do we protect the best, in terms of quality for history going into into the Transport forked London future.

After two weeks in a critical condition, Pauline Cafferkey speaks exclusively to BBC News about her ordeal. I’m very happy to be alive, I certainly am, and without the Royal Free I wouldn’t be here. A Ukip MEP defects to the Conservatives, but his former party call his integrity into question. 30 people are killed, as Russian-backed rebels launch a major offensive in eastern Ukraine. Good evening. The first Briton to be diagnosed with Ebola in the UK has been given the all-clear and discharged from hospital. Nurse Pauline Cafferkey spent almost a month in a high-level isolation unit and was in a critical condition for two weeks. Speaking exclusively to BBC News today, she said that at one point she feared she might not survive. Our health correspondent, Branwenjeffreys, reports. Pauline Cafferkey has been through a life changing ordeal. Today she told me she’s been overwhelmed by good wishes. Nurses filled a Scottish flag with messages, a happier memory than the day she was told she had Ebola. I had a lovely doctor with me here. She sat with me for a while. She did say to me, ""How do you feel? I said, I’ve got a battle on my hands, which I did. Was there a point for you, when you really thought you might not make it? There was a point, which I remember clearly saying, I don’t know which doctors were with me, I remember saying, ""That’s it. I’ve had enough."" This is how she got ready for work in Sierra Leone. Nurses and doctors have risked their lives to contain the outbreak. Cases are falling, but still more than 8,000 people have died. It’s a world away from the isolation unit in London. Pauline was given intensive care inside a sealed tent. The royal free has successfully treated two British nurses now. Buff while -- has successfully treated two British nurses now. Buff while -- but while Will Pooley made a rapid recovery. Pauline Cafferkey became critically ill, which shows how inpredictable the virus can be. We used an antiviral drug and a blood product from someone who has survived Ebola to fight the illness. I have lots of nice letters and cards... Pauline’s exhausted but back on her feet, reading cards and letters sent from around the world. I’m just a nurse doing a job that I love. And these people that don’t know me are just writing to me. Things like, you don’t know me, many nurses as well, which is nice. You make me proud to be a nurse. Would you go back out to West Africa or to another similar situation again having been through this once already? I would have to think seriously about it. I’m definitely going to give aid work a breakfor a while. I want definitely going to give aid work a break for a while. I want to go definitely going to give aid work a breakfor a while. I want to go back to my normaljob, normal life. I think my family would be happy with that as well. You must be just so incredibly relieved. I am very happy to be alive. Yes, I certainly am. Pauline Cafferkey there, speaking to our Health Correspondent, Bra nwen jeffreys. A UKIP MEP has defected to the Conservatives, but his former party said it had suspended him over financial and employment concerns. Amjad Bashir- who represents Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire - said only the Tories could be trusted to deliver a referendum on Europe. UKIP says Mr Bashir has extremely serious questions to answer. He denies any wrongdoing. Our political correspondent, Iain Watson, has the story. party leader, Amjad Bashir is a businessman from an Asian background, who did so much to undermine the stereotype a typical Ukip activist. So the Conservatives were delighted when he decided to leave Ukip and defect to them. In an exclusively BBC interview, he claimed that only David Cameron could deliver an in-out referendum on the EU. I’ve decided to leave because I feel that Ukip will not be able to deliver, will not be able to deliver on the promises that I made to the electorate. And the only party who are in a position to be able to call a referendum is the Conservative Party. It’s the decision for local people... The defection of Conservative MPs to Ukip mirrored the shift in allegiance amongst some voters too. So David Cameron announced his delight to see a politician move in the opposite direction and one who’s willing to denounce his former Ukip colleagues. I’m afraid not all, but some of the MEPs do not behave as they should, if I may say so, they’ve become a bit of a laughing stock. Butjust before he went public with his resignation, Ukip dropped this bombshell. In a statement they said: Mr Bashir told the BBC he hadn’t done anything wrong. I understand the Prime Minister met Amjad Bashir for an hour yesterday to discuss his defection. The Conservatives say Ukip are now trying to smear their prized catch. For their part, Ukip claim that Mr Bashir refused to attend a meeting with Nigel Farage and simplyjumped before he was pushed. All this suggests that the forth coming election campaign will be intensely, bitterly contested. Police in Gloucestershire have launched a murder inquiry, after the death of a man who was attacked with a machete. The 19-year-old, named locally as Zac Evans, was involved in a fight near a pub in Tuffleyjust after midnight. Two other men - aged 18 and 22 - were injured. One person is now in custody, but police are asking for any witnesses to come forward. David Cameron and the Prince of Wales have arrived in Saudi Arabia to pay their respects following the death of King Abdullah. Some human rights groups have criticised the trip calling for condemnation of Saudi Arabia’s regime. japan’s prime minister has condemned the release of a video, which claims one of the two japanese hostages, being held by Islamic State extremists, has been killed. He called it an act of outrageous violence and vowed not to give into terrorism. Officials are trying to establish the authenticity of the video. Our correspondent, Rupert Wingfield Hayes, reports from Tokyo. Kenji Goto in a video last year, before crossing into Syria and into his Islamic State territory. He knew the dangers. It is my responsibility, if something happens. He’s reported from war zones for over 20 years. In Africa, Afghanistan and the Middle East. But since October, he’s been held captive in Syria alongside this man, Haruna Yukawa. Mr Yukawa was a self-styled military consultant. He says he was going to Syria to set up a security company. Islamic State was demanding a $200 million ransom for the two men. Their deadline ran out on Friday. The japanese government says it’s working quickly to verify the new video, which the BBC is not showing. Init to verify the new video, which the BBC is not showing. In it there’s a single image of Kenji Goto chained by the wrists and in his hands a dreadful photograph of his fellow captive Mr Yukawa, who appears to have been murdered. ""I’ve not words to describe the pain these families are going through"" said the prime minister. ""It’s outrageous. It’s unforgiveable."" unforgiveable. "" His unforgiveable."" His mother has begged for her son’s life. He looked extremely nervous, she said. ""I’m sure he feels gravely about what is to come. There’s no time to be optimistic."" Islamic State has changed its terms. They want the release of this woman. She’s a suicide bomber who was arrested during the 2005 Oman bombings injordan. She survived because her belt failed to detonate. It’s no longer about money. It’s now a demand for a prisoner swap. Greeks go to the polls tomorrow in a general election watched closely across Europe. The Greek Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras, said that despite years of austerity, the country was showing signs of recovery. However, the far-left party Syriza has been leading in the polls and has sparked fears that Greece could default on its debt and exit from the euro. Around 30 people have been killed and around Ao others wounded by rocket attacks in the port of Mariupol in Eastern Ukraine, according to the authorities. A pro-Russian rebel leader says they launched the offensive. Ukrainian officials say homes, a school, and a market were hit in the attacks. Our correspondent, David Stern, reports from the Ukrainian capital Kiev. This report contains images which some viewers may find distressing. The rockets broke, the morning calm, slamming into a residential area and laying waste to an open-air market. Dazed inhabitants searched for friends and loved ones. For some, the loss was overwhelming. This is the latest front in Ukraine’s war, the strategic port of Mariupol. Untilthis moment, it’s been outside the fighting, but now, bodies lie on these ordinary suburban streets. In the past months, hostility decreased. But now they’ve returned with a vengeance. Fighting rages across the frontline. Ukrainian forces are losing ground to Russian-backed separatists. Mariupol is strategically located. If the rebels were to take it, it would be a major step in creating a land break leaving -- would be a major step in creating a land break leaving -- leading Russia to Crimea. In Kiev Ukrainian officials say Russia is fuelling the fighting, which Moscow denies. The pro-Russian rebels possess impressive fire power. Ukraine’s Army spokesman said that three rocket attacks hit Mariupol today, aimed at civilian targets. International monitors rushed to Mariupol to inspect the destruction. Concerns are growing that the war is entering a more dangerous stage. But the biggest question is: Will tomorrow bring more blood shed? With all the sport, here’s Katherine Downes at the BBC Sport Centre. We start with an extraordinary day of FA Cup football. Match of the Day has the fourth round goals coming up after the news, but if you want the results now, then here they come. The top two teams in the Premier League have been knocked out - Chelsea were 2-0 up but were beaten A-2 by League One side Bradford. Managerjose Mourinho said he was ""ashamed"" and ""embarrassed"" at the club’s exit. And Manchester City fell to Championship side Middlesborough - losing 2-0 at the Etihad, after second-half goals from Patrick Bamford and Kike. There were also wins for Blackburn, who knocked out Premier League Swansea, after a 3-1 win. Tottenham lost to the Premier League’s bottom side Leicester, Crystal Palace beat Southampton, and Liverpool were held to a goal-less draw. They’ll have to go to Bolton for a replay. Celtic have opened up a three-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership with a narrow win against bottom side Ross County. Kris Commons beat County goalkeeper, Antonio Reguero, early in the second half with the aid of a huge deflection off Paul Quinn for a 1-0 win. There were also wins today for Inverness, Dundee United and Dundee. Rugby Union, and in a dramatic last round of pool matches, Northampton limped into the last eight of rugby’s European Champions Cup, despite a humiliating 32-8 defeat to Racing Metro. Leicester’s hopes of reaching the quarter-finals were ended by Ulster. And Wasps face a nervous wait for tomorrow’s results, after drawing 20-20 with Leinster. Patrick Gearey watched the action. In nature yellow and black is a warning to predators, do not approach. But in the chase for a champions cup quarter final spot, Leinster Huntered wasps, taking advantage whenever they were weakest. The home side had a man in the sin-binn when McFAeden crossed. Leinster eased towards the knockout stage, wasps were handling pressure as well as their turfs. They gave away a second try before the break. They were inspired in the second half. Hughes scored the second try from 26, it was -- 20-6, it was 20-20. Any try, any kick could take them through. They cleared the stage for Andy Goode. He couldn’t add the crucial three. for Andy Goode. He couldn’t add the crucialthree. It crucial three. It was over, a draw that sends Leinster through and keeps wasps holding their breath until tomorrow. A tie may not be good enough for them, but a defeat did the job for Northampton and a big one at that. Racing Metro ran through the Premiership leaders as few sides can. The Saints limp on as one of the best runners on. Tom Wood will be a doubt for England’s Six Nations opener against Wales. The England forward jeff Parling lasted three minutes. His team-mates weren’t spared the pain. Hopes of the bonus point win were swept away. Ulster were already out. They’ve taken Leicester with them. More rugby tomorrow. That’s all the sport. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. But from me, for now, goodnight. Hello. Tomorrow’s not going to be quite so sunny across the country. It won’t be that crisp either. Today has been a lovely day. Hopefully you managed to make the most of the sunshine that we had. There’s some rain on the way, particularly for western areas of the UK.

The cast and fans of Coronation Street pay tribute to Anne Kirkbride, the soap’s star who has died at the age of 60. Her comedy timing was second to none. It was absolutely brilliant. Even in tragedy, she tried to get a laugh and usually did. On BBC London, the mother who says her toddler received appalling care while being treated for cancer at a hospital in Hertfordshire. And the mystery of the pollution hotspots which appears to have cleaned up its act. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The japanese Prime Minister has vowed to save the lives of two hostages being held by Islamic State fighters. In a video released online, a masked IS fighter - thought to be the man known asjihadi john - threatens to kill the two japanese nationals unless a ransom is paid within in 72 hours. Our correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes sent this report from Tokyo. The same SBITIE OFBFIQE black clad figure, the same empty piece of desert, but this time the ultimatum from Islamic State is different. In a statement, the black clad figure demands 200 million US dollars for the lives of the two japanese hostages. It is exactly the same figure pledged by the japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this week to help countries fighting against Islamic State. Injure Rousseau, Shinzo Abe reacted with anger and indignation and demanded the release of the men immediately. -- indignation and demanded the release of the men immediately. -- in jerusalem.

A big chunk of the japanese population believes any price is worth paying for a japanese life, and japan has paid for, but there are two reasons why he probably won’t pay. The first is the amount is so huge, and the second is that it is being done in the full glare of the international media and he will not want to look weak. Rupert Wingfield Hayes, Tokyo. Surgeons have carried out the UK’s first successful organ transplant from a newborn baby. The parents of a six-day-old girl agreed to organ donation after her heart stopped beating. Her kidneys and her liver cells were given to two different patients. Our correspondent Sophie Hutchinson has more. Hammersmith Hospital in London where this ground-breaking organ donation took place. The identity of the patient is protected, and doctors have simply disclose that it was a baby girl who became Britain’s’s first newborn donor. The parents are going through a difficult grieving process, and on top of that you are asking them to think about and make a decision about organ donation. But I would like to congratulate the parents for their brave and courageous decision. The hospital carries out hundreds of transplant operations east-- each year, but medics said this operation was incredibly difficult. The donor baby had been born in extremely poor health after her heart stopped, her kidney and liver cells were donated to two patients. There are very few newborn transplants worldwide, but experts are hopeful that a change in regulations here around diagnosing a baby’s death will enable more to take place. By diagnosing brain death we can allow organ donation when it is appropriate, and that will help the families of that child, knowing that out of their tragedy and disaster has come life-saving benefits for others. And, of course, it will help not only the recipients of those organs, but their families as well. Experts are hopeful this will help the 185 babies waiting each year in the UK for a life-saving transplant. Sophie Hutchinson, BBC News. Well, now we can speak to the man who led the teams who carried out the operations, Doctor Atreja. First of all, could you explain why it has not been done before? I’m sorry, I can’t hear you properly. Can you explain why this is a UK first and why it has not been done before? I think one of the main reasons why this has not happened before is that this particular organ donation is one we were able to do after the heart had stopped beating, but what we do not have is a guideline which will enable us to diagnose brain death. Previously the thought process was that the quality of organs might not be good enough once the heart stops beating. And thatis once the heart stops beating. And that is why, in the absence of guidelines for brain stem death, this territory has not been explored before. Even with those guidelines you are talking to parents at the most difficult time of their lives. How were you able to persuade parents in this case to go ahead? Yes, it is an incredibly difficult time for the whole family. Especially for the parents. Their expectation at the time of birth is that they will have a healthy child, but they had a sick child, and a very hard time for the family. It is always a very difficult situation for us, as a team, to communicate with them and tell them the facts and tell them what the future holds for the tiny one when we know she will be dying. And then to talk to them about this aspect of neonatal care, which is an organ donation that has not happened before, which we are not clear about. It was really very difficult. But as I have said before, the parents were courageous. They were brave and they took on the message very nicely and clearly. And they made a decision very quickly after we spoke to them. Doctor, very good of you to give a short time. Thank you. -- Doctor, very good of you to give a short time. Thank you. -- give us your time. Lord Mandelson has dismissed Ed Miliband’s plan for a mansion tax - one of Labour’s flagship policies for the general election. In an interview on Newsnight, the former Business Secretary criticised the tax as ""short-termist"". Our political correspondent Iain Watson reports. Labour say they win the election they intend to find more than £1 billion for the NHS. they intend to find more than £1 billion forthe NHS. By billion for the NHS. By taking more tax from people who own properties like these. If you occupy a home worth more than £2 million you could be facing a bill of at least £250 more each month, but the architect of previous Labour victories is not convinced this policy is has been thought through. I think we don’t have an efficient system of taxing property in Britain. I don’t happen to think that the Mansion tax is the right policy response to that. I think it is crude, sort of short-term it. Last month Peter Mandelson expressed his concerns to the Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls. He had already fight -- the Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls. He had already fight -- already mollified the Labour policy to make it less crude making sure that people facing the basic rate of income tax would not face new charges until the property was sold unlike existing council tax, new property bands would be introduced to make sure the most expensive homes would be taxed more. People understand the need to introduce a tax where there is a peep -- understand the need to introduce a tax where there is a peep -- an issue of lots of money for people not paying the growing rate. There is a huge disparity between what the average council tax payer pays what are person with a huge Manson pays. Almost half the home -- are person with a huge Manson pays. Almost half the home -- homes facing the tax would be in Westminster or Kensington and Chelsea, just two of the 32 boroughs of London. And they -- Labour say that the 15 million home owners in England and Wales, only 70,000 would face higher bills. Nonetheless, this left-wing MP could land Labour with unwelcome political baggage. In reality, if the Mansion tax kicks in at £2 million, a relatively small number of voters would be affected, but many more voters, will be alarmed. And the Conservative Party say the Mansion tax is like a house of cards set to collapse as the support is withdrawn. Labour maintain the proposed tax is popular, even within London. Tributes are being paid to actress Anne Kirkbride, who’s died aged 60. She played Deirdre Barlow in Coronation Street for more than Ao years. ITV says she died in hospital in Manchester yesterday after a short illness. William Roache, who played her onscreen husband Ken Barlow, says ""she’ll be greatly missed on and off screen."" Our entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson looks back at her career. ~ I hate this dump, I hate thejob, and I hate... The oversize glasses, the husky voice and the arguments. In 1972 Anne Kirkbride was booked to play Deirdre in Coronation Street forjust one episode. She ended up staying A2 years. Her character became one of the most loved in British soap history. Audiences watched her marry four times, including twice to Ken Barlow. She was a vibrant presence. When she was there, you knew she was there. She was always loving, always happy. There was never a laugh far-away. Last year William Roache appeared in court and was found not guilty of rape charges. Anne Kirkbride appeared as a character witness, calling him the perfect gentleman. Oh, Ken. In Coronation Street, Deirdre was so popular that her plotlines seeped into real life. A love triangle with Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin provided one of the 1980s biggest TV moments. Which man she picked was big news. Manchester United were playing at home, and at half-time they flagged up on the screen, Deirdre is staying with Ken, official. And a huge cheer went up. And then, in 1998, Deirdre became the Weatherfield 1, wrongly imprisoned, and even the Prime Minister Tony Blair got involved, saying that anybody with eyes could see she was innocent. As a mark of respect, Coronation Street has halted filming. The cast has been sent home. And it has been announced that tomorrow’s National TV awards will include a special tribute to Anne Kirkbride. Hello. Mrs Barlow? Deirdre. She may only have had one role, but it satisfied. Anne Kirkbride said Deirdre allowed her to play a full range of emotions, from comedy, tragedy to the everyday. Anne Kirkbride, who’s died aged 60. The former head of the secret intelligence service says that a successful terrorist attack on the United Kingdom is, in his words, ‘highly likely’. Sirjohn Sawers, who left MI6 in November, also said trust between governments and technology companies had been ‘shattered’ by the revelations from Edward Snowden. Sirjohn has been speaking to our Security Correspondent Frank Gardner. Out of the shadows, he has spoken publicly for the first time since November. He ran the secret intelligence service for five years in the UK and says the terrorist threat to Britain has been growing steadily. If I was to sit here and say, will the goalkeepers on the security services and the police keep every single attempt to get the ball into the net out, I would say no. At some point the threats will get through and there will be another terrorist attack in this country. His warning follows this month’s deadly attacks in Paris, amid fears something similar could happen in Britain. In Belgium, the authorities say they stopped a plot to murder police. And in Germany, there have been raids by anti-terrorist police on individuals suspected of links to Islamic extremists in Syria. It is the conflict raging there and in neighbouring Iraq that are pulling in thousands ofjihadists run Europe and the Middle East. Many are returning home after witnessing extreme violence -- returning home after witnessing extreme violence -- from Europe. I asked the former intelligence chief if in hindsight he thought more could have been done to prevent the mayhem now engulfing the region. We could have invested more, early on, in arming the military. We could have invested more in terms of controlling space on the ground, as happened in 1991 in Iraq. But the public appetite here for that was very low, and it’s pretty low in America as well. On the issue of interception of Communications, Sir john said that trust between intelligence agencies, like GCHQ, and the Internet companies had been shattered. He said a new contract between them was needed to prevent further attacks like the one in Paris. Supporting David Cameron’s view, the ex-MI6 chiefs said there should be no no-go areas where terrorists could hide their plans. Frank Gardner, BBC News.

Today is the anniversary of one of the most significant dates in British political history. 750 years ago representatives from all over the country were invited to Westminster to meet for the first time, in what was essentially England’s first parliament. The BBC is marking the date with a day of coverage focusing on democracy. Global rankings rate the UK Government as the most open and transparent in the world, but the man who invented the web, SirTim Berners-Lee, said the UK is one of the worst countries for spying via the internet. Our Home Editor, Mark Easton, went to meet him. In general, when you look at the world, the UK is notjust ahead in open data, but data connection. It is much further ahead. Still a minority of people use the web, only 1+0%. Is it about wealth and development or is it about some governments deliberately trying to prevent citizens from using open data? Yes, wealth has got a lot to do with it. Clearly. On the other hand, if you look at those lists, some countries, despite not having a very big wealth, GDP per capita, they are doing quite well on the web index like Kenya, for example. They got on board, they got excited about it. In other countries, the internet is there, but the government is blocking it, it’s spying on people. Name some names, the real villains around the world, who are the bad guys when it comes to this? Infact, when you are looking at governments that spy on the internet, you might think of countries historically like Iran and Syria famous for this. The US and the UK are famous as well. Are you an optimist when it comes to this kind of thing? The web is humanity connected. When it comes to humanity, yes, I am an optimist. There are lots of things which we can get wrong at this point. There are lots of ways in which governments are tempted to seize too much control. Even a good government can be tempted to give itself control that it wouldn’t want the next government to have. We need to make sure we build in checks and balances and accountability into government. You must be immensely proud that you are the father of this, you are the father of the web. You have created a world in which humanity can connect in that way. Of course, it has been created by massive collaboration with international people. That is what has been really exciting. Yes, I am proud of all of the people out there who decided to put together a website, even though that it is not theirjob. They heard about this web thing and thought, ""I will try that"". People come out of the woodwork doing things because they are just excited about the world they are building. Those are the people I am proud of. The Sun is reported to be dropping its regular Page 3 pictures of topless models. The paper hasn’t yet confirmed the move, but the Sun’s sister paper, The Times, says the change has been approved by the parent company’s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who last year described the images as ""old-fashioned"". The photographs will continue to appear on the Sun’s website. Our correspondent Sangita Myska reports. The less you think about women, the better. Cor blimey, look at her. For All years the Sun argued that Page 3 was just fun, a snapshot of Britain’s uniquely saucy sense of humour captured in a self-proclaimed family newspaper. But could the joke have finally worn thin? The Times, the Sun’s sister paper, has reported that, with the blessing of its owner Rupert Murdoch, Page 3 has been dropped. When this started it was all about an offer to a key constituency, if you like, the working bloke, to say, we will give you what you want. Do not let the BBC or the Guardian or politicians or feminists tell you you can’t have it. The world has moved on. 50% of the Sun’s readers are women. For as long as there has been Page 3 there have been protests against it. The Sun’s stance has shifted here, too. Former MP Clare Short was a vociferous campaigner. As a result she was, says a former Sun editor, subjected to cruel personal attacks. More recent campaigns have been better received by the paper’s owner Rupert Murdoch. Even though, those protesters still feel the battle is not over. I cannot stand and say it is an amazing day for women and female representation in the media when all the Sun have done is stopped showing nipples, but are now going to show women in bikinis or underwear. The Sun is still saying that women are there primarily to decorate the news while the men exist in the news in clothes doing things. Nevertheless, Page 3 still has its defenders, chief among them those who have featured in it. Rather than a victory for feminism they see it as a lost opportunity for empowerment. It is a huge industry orientated by females. You have females in front of the camera, behind the camera, women doing hair and make up. This is going to hit hard on women. The Sun is refusing to confirm or deny whether it has got rid of Page 3. Media experts say that is because if sales begin to fall it wants to be able to reintroduce Page 3 as soon as possible. If you are a Sun reader missing your topless fix, today’s news carries a web link to it online. The financial watchdog, the FCA, has said it will force banks and building societies to tell their customers if they could earn better savings rates elsewhere. It says £160 billion of savings are earning less than 0.5% in interest. With me is our personal finance correspondent. What is the watchdog going to do? A package of measures. One of them is a prominent box which they would display on the front of your regular statements with your savings which would show, for example 05% interest, in the middle of that charge, and to the left of it is the rates you can get from your bank and at the Green end is the average of the ten best rates on the market. Your bank will be telling you you can move to a better rate elsewhere. They will also have to tell you when they open the account of they have a rate that is below the Bank of England base rate, to warn you it is that law. How low can the rates go? It is nearly a quarter of the savings money out there at 0.5%. I found an account paying 0.01%. If you had £100 you would get a penny at the end of the year. 10p for £1000. MPs are urging the government to provide greater protection for dairy farmers, many of whom are struggling to survive after drastic falls in the price of milk. Our environment correspondent Claire Marshall is at dairy farm in Bradley in Staffordshire. This is milking time. This farm has 200 dairy cows. They are milked twice a day. It has been hit hard by the price crashes. You can pay more for a bottle of water than you can for a bottle of milk in some supermarkets. This may be great on a tight budget, but what about if you are a farmer? To keep these cattle well fed and looked after, it costs a farmer about 30p for each litre of milk they produce. The price most farmers now get for this milk is around 20p. That is a drop of almost a third over the last six months. It comes nowhere near covering costs. In the short term we will see farmers going out of business because they cannot compete at these sort of levels. It is notjust farmers struggling, it is the whole chain. Today’s report concludes that the price crash is down to a number of factors, including rising global production and falling demand. Intense competition amongst supermarkets is also having an effect. In several places, you can now buy four pints of milk forjust 89p. MPs believe that the official in charge of monitoring how supermarkets treat their suppliers is too weak to be The Groceries Code Adjudicator needs to be able to fine retailers for bad practice, and launch investigations rather thanjust respond to complaints. It is dangerously low at the moment. Farmers are not covering cost of production. It is unsustainable. We do not want to see farmers moving from production. Then we might be short of milk in this country in 510 years and have to import. -- short of milk in this country in 510 years and have to import. -- five or ten. The main retailers say that they absorb the price cuts through their profits and haven’t changed what they pay retailers. The government says we strongly support the work of the Groceries Code Adjudicator. It’s jurisdiction is currently restricted and does not cover pricing, which is the responsibility of the Competition Markets Authority, and there will be a statutory review next year. MPs are calling for better labelling, so consumers can choose to buy British. The milk industry is being hit so hard that the number of dairy farmers in England and Wales has halved in little more than a decade. This could half again in the next few years. Some say this is a business and you did not hear farmers complaining when prices were high, but the other view is that we need a business that is sustainable and still in business five years from now so that businesses like this need to be supported through these difficult times. England have beaten India by nine wickets with more than 22 overs to spare, to achieve their first win in the Tri-Series tournament in Australia. The fast bowler, Steven Finn, took five wickets as India’s batting collapsed in the One-Day International at the Gabba in Brisbane. Here’s our sports correspondent joe Wilson. For Steve Finn, flying back to Australia was returning to the scene of his great failure. A year ago in Brisbane he was deemed un-selectable by England. Now he was unplayable. He took five wickets in a career-best performance. After endless tinkering with technique he was back to keeping it simple, and pretty quick. Plus, there was Anderson. Comebacks are easy when you make it swing, as Sinatra always proved, and it was his control of the ball on his return from injury that gave him four wickets. India 153 all out. Looks like a six. Look out for the fielder. Faced with the gift of such a small total, England’s batsmen unwrapped it with glee. 88 not out for Ian Bell. There was a 52 forjames Taylor. England won in the 28th over. The World Cup starts next month. What England desperately need now is confidence. It is about transferring that form to the big stage, and that is what we did today. It is a nice building block for us. Hopefully we can keep improving as we get into the World Cup. One thing this victory proves, there is more than one way to win a One-Day International. It is going to be very cold. Glorious pictures. Lovely sunshine, sunrises, across the country. This one near Doncaster. Sunshine and a bit of mist, but it is cold.

This is Watford Hospital where Bella’s mother and father brought her on the 13th of December last year when the little girl was having trouble taking medication for leukaemia. Herfamily say trouble taking medication for leukaemia. Her family say that some of the practices they witnessed here were appalling. They claim students tried to give Bella the wrong medication and they say that poor hygiene meant an infection she had got much worse, and they say that doctors failed to diagnose a case of mucositis which left the little girl unable to eat or drink properly and in constant pain.

A hospital apologises after she got a serious infection and was left fighting for her life. And calls for this former police spy to lose his job at a London university. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. A British man who spent months in Syria encouraging others to come and join so-called Islamic State and then faked his own death has pleaded guilty to terrorism offences. Imran Khawaja from Southall in London used gruesome videos featuring executions to try to recruit others to his cause. When he decided to return to Britain, his death was announced on social media. His cousin has pleaded guilty to driving him back to the UK. Here’s our home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford. Imran Khawaja, seen here with an automatic rifle. One of the most prolific British propagandists for the so-called Islamic State. A 27-year-old amateur bodybuilder, he travelled to Syria one year ago. And here, in the green, on the left, he and his group spent their time encouraging other young British men to join the fighting. Using gruesome videos of death and war. Extreme images of violence. Executions carried out with automatic weapons. And they have used these images to promote their warped brand of Islam. Shiraz Maher of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation told me some videos shocked even his researchers. There was one picture which was very disturbing of him, holding a bag that allegedly had I5 severed heads inside of it of Syrian army soldiers. He called himself Abu Daigham al-Britani and was a member of Rayat Al Taweed, a propaganda group that produces slick posters. But injune, the group suddenly announced his death on their Instagram account. Abu Daigham al-Britani was killed in battle a few nights ago, they wrote. It was a lie. Imran Khawaja had, in fact, decided to return to Britain. But to avoid the attention of the security services, he decided to fake his own death first. His cousin, Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, drove all the way across Europe to Bulgaria to pick him up. But although Imran Khawaja had staged his own death, he had not successfully covered his tracks and as he stepped off the ferry here in Dover, he was met by counterterrorism officers. He has now pleaded guilty to four offences, including attending a terrorist training camp and possessing a weapon for the purposes of terrorism. But it was his enthusiastic work as a PR man for Islamic State that did the greatest harm. And Rayat Al Taweed is still pumping out its propaganda. Trying to add to the 600 Britons who have already travelled to Syria to fight. Daniel Sandford, BBC News. Our Security Correspondent, Frank Gardner, is here. This is the thing the security services are so keen to avoid, Britons going out to Syria to fight or otherwise and then coming back. It is and this is a landmark case because he is probably the most important person to go into the courts to be tried for association with Islamic State. The Group E belonged to is closely affiliated to Islamic State, it is called Rayat Al Taweed, which means the banner of monotheism and are some of the most bloodthirsty of all the fighters out there. This morning, Sirjohn source, who recently retired from MI6, gave his first appearance since stepping down. And we asked him, we said, is it inevitable? That there would be a terrorist attack in this country? He paused and said, given the volume of fighters going out there, the extent of the threat, he said, yes, it is pretty much inevitable that one of the balls is going to get passed into the net. That is a pretty chilling threat, really. Thank you. A nurse murdered three patients and poisoned 18 others by contaminating saline with insulin ""completely at random"", a jury has been told. Victorino Chua, a staff nurse at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, is also accused of deliberately altering the dosages on prescription charts. He denies all the charges, which are alleged to have taken place between 2011 and 2012. judith Moritz reports. Victorino Chua is said to have turned from a man who dedicated his life caring for others to harming them. He was a nurse at Stepping Hill Hospital you stop what and it is alleged that in summer 2011 turned poisoner, tampering with bags of sea lion to be used as drips and contaminating ampoules. The jury heard that he added insulin to them of catastrophic results. Three people died, Tracy Arden, Ali, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and 83-year-old Derek Weaver. Another man was left with brain injury and 17 others were poisoned but later recovered. The iurv poisoned but later recovered. The jury was told that Tim Wan tampered with solutions and left them for their own witty staff to use. Peter Wright QC said they had been like ticking time bombs to be administered by unsuspecting staff to unsuspecting patients. Victorino Chua listened from inside the dock as the jury heard that staff had become suspicious and called police. Security was tightened and in january 2012 he is alleged to have tried a new tactic. It is claimed he altered medical notes so that the amount of drugs prescribed to patients had changed. The prosecution said that again he was trying to poison patients, succeeding in one case. Victorino Chua faces 36 charges, including three of murder. He denies them all. This trial is set to last for four months. The Sun newspaper has reportedly stopped featuring topless women on Page 3. Although the paper hasn’t confirmed or denied the change, according to its sister paper, the Times, it’s been approved by chairman Rupert Murdoch. It’s thought the women featured will now be wearing swimming costumes or underwear instead. Page 3 has been a Sun feature for All years but has been criticised by campaigners as being sexist and outdated. Our Special Correspondent, Lucy Manning, has the story. As the Sun headline might not have said, it is the feminists that won it. The Sun appears to have set on Page 3. If the topless models brought a smile to the morning or made you choke on your cornflakes, well, this morning, bikini is recovering the parts of not normally left to the imagination. Are you vomiting Page 3? It looks weird, I want it back. For this Page 3 girl for six years, not the news she wanted from the paper. I thought we were fighting for women to do what they wanted to do. But we have no choice to do Page 3 because they have taken that choice away. It is Britain’s bestselling daily newspaper and for the Sun, the readership gave it 2 million reasons why it has been able to ignore critics. Is this a victory for campaigners? I cannot say this is an amazing day for women and representation in the media when all the Sun has done is it has stopped showing nipples but will show women in bikinis. It is still saying that women are primarily to decorate the news. Perhaps in this digital age, it was inevitable. Lucy from London will still be topless on the website. Page 3 has been a fixture since 1970. One year after Rupert Murdoch bought the paper. He headed on Twitter earlier this year that its time had come. I think old-fashioned, he said, but readers disagree. So he went to this building site asks readers. Will you stop buying the Sun? Definitely. It is boring. It isjust a bit of fun. If you put David Beckham or someone in his underpants, have it topless blog? Why not? You will not miss this? Not really. I don’t need to be looking at that! The Sun will not actually confirm whether it has dropped Page 3 as we know it for good. And they could still surprise everyone tomorrow with another topless picture. But the paper has always been a paper of the readers and if the readers do not desert this in droves over this change, it does look like the end of an era for Page 3. The less you think about women, the better. Look at! The end of a very British institution. Lucy seems to have been the very last one on a page that has split opinion. Northern Ireland Water says it doesn’t homes and businesses are without water because of a work-to-rule I start protesting changes to the pension scheme. The action means a out-of-hours repairs are not being carried out as normal. Andy Martin reports. For seven days, makeshift distribution points have been essential stops for some families as what has become a precious commodity. It has been much worse to the West, where the weather has been both help and hindrance. Some farmers had been forced to leave the hills around County Tyrone to get water for their animals. But some livestock can look after themselves. The sheep are out on the hills, they are able to use the snow for themselves. We have one day off? I am helping daddy around the farm. Some need clean what are more than most. Having already been forced to close because of last week’s bad weather, many schools have again had to send pupils home. Total inconvenience. We take it for granted but even for going to the toilet or washing your hands, general bottles, it is awful. It needs to be sorted out soon. The staff at Northern Ireland Water are still working but whenever there is a problem out of hours, at an isolated water treatment plant, like this, they are refusing to respond because they say the proposed changes to the pension plan could leave them up to £100 worse off every month. Negotiations may continue through the night but almost 8000 homes and businesses are still disconnected. What appears to be a video by so-called Islamic State has been released threatening to kill two japanese hostages unless a ransom of $200 million is paid within the next three days. The japanese Prime Minister has described the threat as unforgivable and vowed to do everything possible to save the hostages. From Tokyo, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes sent this report. Kenji Goto is a well- known documentary maker. He was last seen crossing the border into Syria last October. Haruna Yukahawa is a self-styled military contractor. Some have called him a fantasist, a water is. Videos on his website show him in northern Syria, dressed in combat fatigues and carrying an assault rifle. The threat to execute these men is clearly designed to scare japanese people and turn them against any involvement in the fight against Islamic State. In a statement, it demanded 200 million dollars for these japanese men. Exactly the same figure pledged by japan’s Prime Minister to help countries fighting against Islamic State. Injerusalem, the Prime Minister rejected this demand. TRANSLATION: This is unforgivable and Ifeel strong TRANSLATION: This is unforgivable and I feel strong resentment. and Ifeel strong resentment. I strongly demand that Islamic State does not hurt these japanese citizens and immediately releases them. Other countries, including France and Italy, are reported to have paid large ransoms for the release of hostages. Although both have denied this. In the past, japan has handed over large sums of money to get citizens back. But this time it is different. Firstly, the amount demanded isjust so vast but perhaps more importantly, both these men went to Syria willingly, knowing how dangerous it is. And that is likely to meet other demands to get them back at any price.

The UK Government has emerged as the most open and transparent in the world, according to global rankings looking at access to public data. The announcement coincides with the 750th anniversary of the first constituency Parliament to gather at Westminster, a predecessor to the Houses of Parliament. As part of the BBC’s Democracy Day, our home editor, Mark Easton, asks whether so much information at one’s fingertips is necessarily a good thing. The digital revolution promises to transform the way we’re governed, allowing citizens to access data on every aspect of the state. The UK Parliament, it emerges, leads the world in digital openness and transparency, but the man who made all of this possible, the inventor of the worldwide web, and father of the digital age, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, says even data like post codes is not yet freely available. You think that the postcode would be just something that is part of the open structure of the UK and it’s not actually. Post codes are created by the Post Office. Of course, the Post Office is now an individual corporation. So ironically, just the list of places in the UK is not available openingly for free on the web. Today’s report puts the UK ahead of Sweden and the US at the top of the open data league table. Data do the gov do the UK now lists details of Government expenditure. Information updated almost data. Ministers hope that this website will inspire an army of arm chair auditors to go through spending line for line. We now know that DEFRA recently spent £5lIlI.88 on components o for an inhouse built electronic fish measurement system. We don’t know whether that is a bargain or a scandal. Data has inspired a legion of young software designers, with the blessing of parliamentary authorities, are inventing tools to make sense of all the information. One of the things that MPs are trying to get Government to do is to make sure data is produced in useable for mats. just dumping data is not the answer. It ticks a box, it doesn’t do the job. We’ve got to make sure that is easily accessible. There are now hundreds of Whitehall civil servants with jobs described as digital or social media managers, outside governments investigative journalists and professional mischief makers are probing the digital world. mischief makers are probing the digitalworld. If digital world. If it’s embarrassing it will get lost, published next week. It aes in in a document format thatis week. It aes in in a document format that is difficult to find out. There is false openness. There is an irony in all of this. The more institutions like Parliament open up to the digital revolution, the more, it seems, we distrust them.

The parents of a six-day-old girl agreed to donate her organs after her heart stopped. The baby’s kidneys and liver cells were then given to two different patients. Our health correspondent, Branwenjeffreys, is here. This was a pioneering procedure for British surgeons? It was the first time organs had been taken from such a tiny baby to be used in organ donation in the UK. At the heart of it, a remarkable conversation, and a very difficult one, between the parents of that little girl, just a few days old, coming to terms with the fact that she wasn’t going to survive. On the other hand, the doctor who asked them would they donate her kidneys and cells from her liver? He described today their decision to say yes as remarkable and courageous. He said it took very little time for them to reach their decision. We know now that donors, whose age and identity we don’t know, are doing well as a result of their generosity. It could pave the way for other similar donations in the future. Thank you very much. The AirAsia plane that crashed into the java Sea last month may have climbed too fast and then stalled.

In the case of one group of ambulance workers with one union it will be a 21+-hour walk-out. From Department of Health sources there is concern about the impact on patient safety. I’m told that the Secretary of State, jeremy Hunt will tell unions they wants assurances at national level that blue light calls to ambulances will not be affected. Unions say they are having to escalate this because their demand for pay has been rejected. The recommendation of an independent pay review body was rejected by this government. Hugh Pym, thank you very much. MPs are urging the Government to provide greater protection for dairy farmers, many of whom are struggling after dramatic falls in the price of milk. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is calling for more powers to investigate and impose fines on supermarkets if they don’t treat milk suppliers fairly. Our environment correspondent, Claire Marshall, is at dairy farm in Bradley in Staffordshire. Claire, these are very tough times for dairy farmers? They are very hard times, yes, Fiona. This small dairy farm has suffered real hits. The cows are sheltered from the snowfalling outside, but it’s not all cosy. Think about it, you can now pay more for water than you do for milk. To keep these dairy cows content it costs the farmer around 30p for each litre of milk they produce. Now, some farmers are being paid as little as 20p, a drop of almost a third over the last six months and it doesn’t even cover costs. Paul Holt owns this herd of 200 in Staffordshire. We will see farmers going out of business because they can’t compete at these sort of levels. It’s not just farmers that are struggling, it’s the whole chain. The processing business, we’ve got problems with certain dairy companies, they can’t pay the farmers. They’ve had to defer the payments for two weeks. It’s an industry wide problem. According to today’s report, the price crash is the result of rapidly rising global production and falling demand. Intense competition among retailers is also having an effect. In several supermarkets, including Asda, Aldi and Lidl, you can now buy four pints of milk forjust 89p. That’s great news if you’re a shopper, not so good if you own a dairy herd. Supermarkets should be fined if they squeeze suppliers, according to the committee and smaller dairy farmers need more protection, but the retail industry says its playing fair. I think it’s great value for consumers and we know actually, if you look at it, milk sales have been increasing. So consumers clearly do like that. I think the key challenge for retailers, which we’re quite happy to answer, is - are you paying a fair price to the farmer? Yes, we are. No matter where the blame lies, the industry is being hit hard. The number of dairy farmers in England and Wales has halved in little more than a decade. Claire Marshall, BBC News, Staffordshire. The cast of Coronation Street have been paying tribute to the actress Anne Kirkbride, who has died after a short illness. She played the character Deirdre for more than Ao years.

The home of Ken and Deirdre, so much has happened on these cobbles. Anne Kirkbride was at the very heart of what was some of the most watched moments in British TV history. I hate this dump. I hate thejob. And I hate... Deirdre! Deirdre’sjust been part of life for many of us. I don’t want it at all. Anne Kirkbride was 17 when she first took on the role. I was down here for an audition for something. They said, while you’re here, just nip over the Coronation Street Street office because they’re looking for someone to do three lines in the Street. Same again? No, not for me, thanks, jimmy, I have to be off. Oh, so soon? Those three lines turned into the role of a lifetime. I just didn’t want to make a fool of myself. There were a number of on screen relationships, but the heart of it was Ken and Deirdre, the Barlows’. Very tough. Really, really tough. Actually, just walking in here now. It’s very difficult because all of us wanted to carry on filming today. That’s the natural feel. For Anne’s sake and all our sakes, but when it came to it, we couldn’t do it. Today, outside the Barlows’ house, a moment of reflection from the fans. What was it you liked about Deirdre? She was a character, wasn’t she? We could relate to her as ourselves. I think that realism is a key part to it. That’s why people tended to love her so. I actually met her a couple of times in real-life. Yeah, I liked her very much. OK, Deirdre, come on. What are you doing? The prison episodes provoked words of support from the Prime Minister. These were some of British TV’s most watched moments. Why did you put the phone down on me? The love triangle with Mike Baldwin, the crowd at Old Trafford had to be kept up-to-date. It flashed up on the screen at Old Trafford and it said ""Deirdre goes back to Ken."" They all went. BOO. Anne’s real-life marriage began with this onscreen romance. She had her struggles, cancer, depression, but she was always grateful for Deirdre. The ups and downs, those glasses. The Street has lost one of its stars. I’m going to miss her. Definitely. Anne Kirkbride, who died yesterday. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Darren Bett.

He was exposed as a police spy and it is alleged that he headed up a squad that spied on other campaigners. One year later he began working on other campaigners. One year later he began working Rwanda Metropolitan University. I actively encouraged him to apply for the position because he is an extremely extinguished academic, he has extremely risk -- extremely extinguished academic, he has extremely risk -- rich experience, excepting that some of thatis experience, excepting that some of that is controversial. There is no reason whatsoever that Bob should not have been offered employment at this university. He went on to say that he did not teach these practices and has classes. He is a part-time lecturer, utilised in our undergraduate teaching programmes. He is not involved in the consultancy work that we do abroad. But his critics are growing more confident. Some plan to picket the university campus. There are all sorts of enquiries that have been announced. He was one of the main players in this pattern of working over these years and he we believe that he should be held to account. There are those that believe that a higher price still needs to be paid. Two women have been seriously injured by falling scaffolding near Liverpool Station.

Labour’s proposed ""mansion tax"" is ""crude"" and ""short-termist"" according to the ex-Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson. The tax which would be levied on properties worth more than £2 million is a key part of Ed Miliband’s plan to win the next General Election. He plans to spend the money it raises on the NHS. But some within his own party - including London Labour MPs - aren’t happy, as our political editor Tim Donovan reports. This is the Labour leader ‘s home turf. It is not unusual for people to have bought their homes Ao years ago and have seen their property places go up to the millions. It has gone up for a lot of people. They haven’t got any money. They are not rich people. Labour says people in the property is worth between two and £3 million will pay around an extra £3000 a year. Anyone on the basic rate of income tax in earning less than EA2,000 will be able to defer until sale or death. This architect of previous Labour victories says it has not been thought through. We do not have an efficient system for taxing property in Britain. I don’t think the mansion taxes correct policy response to that. I think it is crude and short-term. Lord Mandelson said the Lib Dems’s policy was better. We want a fairer system. We want people in these properties to make a contribution, but with bands. One of the important distinctions between the council tax and our proposal is that we are seeing that anyone that act a basic rate taxpayer will be able to put off this charge until the get rid of the property at a time of their own choosing. This intervention has not been surprised until Labour figures. Peter Mandelson is well remembered for seeing he was intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich. But it is another father saying about how the mansion tax could become one of the trickiest issues the Labour Party face in the next election. The party has calculated that concerns will be offset by approval. That is that the issue here. How far, if at all, will the number of people who are affected to your who have concerns about this tax be overshadowed or outnumbered by those who aren’t and who see some kind of justice in seeing-- in who aren’t and who see some kind of justice in seeing -- in trying to capture the value here. If you do not see London in a solution from the rest of the country, in strict terms of electoral strategy, you can see how Labour fuelled it will be more people begin gain ball was, given the what to put money into the national health service. It made not specifically affect that many people, the charge itself, relatively speaking, to others and may be the perception that there is a direction of travel and the liberal will be looking at properties under 2 million at some stage. Still to come tonight: Churchill’s funeral was one of the biggest London ever seen. 50 years on, we look at his legacy. I’m at the Royal Academy for what is probably the first blockbuster show of the year. It’s notorious for being one of the capital’s pollution hot-spots but, in recent tests, levels of nitrogen dioxide on the Marylebone Road appear to have fallen sharply. The drop is so great, the levels no longer breach the European limit. City Hall says it shows the Mayor’s policies are working, but air campaigners are baffled. Here’s our environment correspondent Tom Edwards. Two roads and now two different levels of certain types of air pollution. Experts call Oxford Street a street canyon, pollution from mainly diesel engines gets trapped. Scientists say it has the highest level of harmful nitrogen dioxide in Europe. And this year, it has already breached the number of hours it is allowed to be above the legal limit. It is something you have to live with. This is London, capital of the world. I don’t think of it as much asl should do, I suppose. While this monitoring station is still recording higher levels of nitrogen dioxide, on the nearby busy Marylebone Road, the levels there have calmed down. In 2013, there were 150 hourly exceedences, but that dropped to just 12 in 2014. Campaigners say if it can happen there, why can’t it happen here? Marylebone Road has been a pollution hot-spot. Air quality campaigners are hopeful but baffled. We know TfL have sprayed outside of monitoring stations to dampen down the pollution levels and I am wondering whether some sort of fix is going on here to try and disguise the nature of the problem in London because it is still a very serious problem. What’s troubling is that the Marylebone Road monitor is used by the government to report the highest levels of pollution in London to the European Commission, and that is clearly not the highest level any more. City Hall says the fall on Marylebone Road in nitrogen dioxide is very encouraging and it shows that the Mayor of London’s policies are working. The measures he is taking to improve the air quality have been taken across London. The taxi fleet renewal with the age limit, they go everywhere. The buses, again, hundreds of hybrids already on the street and that will improve air quality everywhere. It’s not a conspiracy theory. The Mayor’s office concedes it is just the start and much more still needs to be done to improve London’s poor air quality. When Sir Winston Churchill, died injanuary 1965, thousands of Londoners lined the streets to watch his state funeral procession. 50 years on, a series of special events are being held throughout 2015 to remember the Prime Minister who led Britain to victory in the Second World War. Alice Bhandhukravi is at an event marking Churchill’s legacy. Alice. If there’s anything to showcase the events that will be happening throughout the year. First, a look back at events of 50 years ago. It was the 30th ofjanuary 1965. A state funeral for the man many consider to be one of the greatest statesman of the 20th century. There was a sense that church was funeral represented not only has on passing but perhaps the passing of Aida of British national greatness and up looking forward, Britain without a church would be in some ways a lesser nation. City simply came to a standstill for much of this Saturday on which the funeral card. It was an extraordinary event because I think anybody that watched it, or watched it on television, felt that nothing like this would ever happen again. My parents were very intent on not spoiling their children. They did not say that he was a grand man, and it was only at his funeral that I realised what an extraordinary figure that he was. It was a life that was in its time utterly unique. And waited to say that I am now joined by his great-grandson, who, you were barely born at that time. I was only two days old. I am very main fault of this commemoration. My great-grandfather, he was so proud of his heritage and what he had achieved. It is hard to imagine any other leader, 50 years after his death, being commemorated in this way. What can people look forward to in this year? Winston has a very special place in people ‘s hearts. Tower Bridge is being opened up. We are mindful that at that time, the cleanest are mindful that at that time, the clea nest depths cleanest depths and their necks to PGY cleanest depths and their necks to pay tribute to my great grandfather. Ifeel that pay tribute to my great grandfather. I feel that today, in grandfather. Ifeel that today, in our own way, we are doffing our hat and paying tribute. We are the generation that has been fortunate to not know the horrors of world War. Particularly, as we are losing that a generation that gave us our freedoms, it is important to mark this occasion. It is a website, huge resource as well, because part of his legacy as an educational one. We created this website to provide a wealth of information for young and old on Churchill, from both good size and other sides. The wonderful thing is that we’re going to do a school assembly and you can look up, if schools want to have assemblies, they can look it up on our website. And if you want to see some of that colour footage again, just go to our Facebook page. The address should be on your screen. And do tell us about your memories of Churchill’s funeral or stories that have been passed down to you by relatives. Now to an old master, and a new exhibition showing Rubens’s vast influence on other artists from across the centuries. It’s not only a chance to see some his great works but also some of the paintings of those he inspired, from Van Dyck to Cezanne. Our arts correspondent Brenda Emmanus reports from the Royal Academy. He is a 17th-century Flemish painter known for his strong use of colour, his religious works, and his depiction of fleshy women. But now the Royal Academy is hosting a major exhibition looking at the work of Rubens and his influence on other artists, and tell us more is the curator. Heads were probably the most exciting part works of the time. With over 160 works, the show explores how his visual language and style affected the work of some of the greatest teams to have followed him. The ceiling in Whitehall as a masterpiece and the only surviving one painted in situ by the artist. He painted everything from battle scenes to landscapes. As work and legacy is presented with six themes. I think this show will try and redress the balance that he is so many different kinds of artist. If you walk around the show, she doesn’t even have a signature style or the way through. One of the things that we will learn is that subtly and significantly, he adapts his process to subject matter and take. British artistjenny his process to subject matter and take. British artist jenny Savill has generated a room bringing together artists from the castle to the present day whose work he connects with Rubens. Well the Sun newspaper bids for well to its infamous page three, this work goes on short from Saturday. Football, and Chelsea hope to take a step towards Wembley tonight as they travel to Liverpool for the first leg of the League Cup semifinal. jose Mourinho’s side are still in contention to win four trophies this season. And, with Spurs facing Sheffield United in the other semi, there’s the prospect of an all-London final at Wembley in March. This is an opportunity to win a trophy and a competition which will bring the future of the team on. Our next game is the biggest game, always. Always. Novikov becomes the most important competition. It’s as simple as that. And now the weather. You will notice some white collars there. It is the time is that we can see a little bit of snow on top of the Saudi donors for a time tonight. At the War 11 was most of what we will see will be green. Not quite as cold as last night, temperatures above zero. Tomorrow, this area of low pressure is dominating our weather and this weather front as well, which will hang around for a good part of the day. It is cloudy and damp to start in the morning and cold. Through the afternoon, there will be some outbreaks of rain but we are hopeful it will ease off to get something drier and greater, but always feeling cold. More of the same at first tomorrow night, still cloudy and outbreaks of rain, but as the night wears on, that will start to ease away and we will start to see some clearer skies developing. Temperatures close to freezing and he could see a frost, Thursday morning. We are in between weather systems on Thursday, so there should be some dry and great weather, but still feeling cold. The weather system will bring some outbreaks of rain into Friday and briefly something milder before the cold beer returns on Saturday. The theme for the next few days as staying cold. There will be some outbreaks of rain tomorrow night, Thursday to be called but dry and plate and Freddie should have a fix of rain but with something a less cold. A reminder of the day’s headlines. A man from London, who tried to recruit people to so-called Islamic State and then faked his own death, has pleaded guilty to terrorism offences. Imran Khawaja, from Southall, used videos featuring executions to try to recruit others to his cause. That’s it, thanks forjoining us.

And, countless tributes to Anne Kirkbride, The former head of the secret intelligence service says that a terrorist attack here is, in his words, highly likely. Sirjohn Good evening. A Britishjihadist, who spent six months in Syria, has admitted a series of terrorism offences. Imran Khawaja, from west London, had posted violent and graphic images online as part of a propaganda campaign in support of Islamic State militants. He then faked his own death to try to return to the UK undetected. The hearing took place last year, but has now become reportable, after his cousin admitted aiding his return. Imran Khawaja, seen here with an automatic rifle, one of the most prolific British propagandists for the so-called Islamic State. A 27-year-old amateur body-builder, he travelled to Syria a year ago and, here in the green on the left, he and his group spent their time encouraging other young British men tojoin the fighting using gruesome videos of death and war. Extreme images of violence, executions carried out with automatic weapons, and they have used these images to promote their warped brand of Islam. A researcher at the International Centre For The Study of Radicalisation told me some of the videos shocked even his researchers. There was one disturbing picture of him holding a bag that allegedly had I5 severed head inside it of Syrian army soldiers. He called himself Abu Daigham al-Britani and was a member of a propaganda group that produces slick posters. It was they who announced his death on their Instagram account injune. It was a lie. He had, in fact, decided to return to Britain. But to avoid the attention of the security services, he decided to fake his own death first. His cousin, Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, drove all the way across Europe to Bulgaria to pick him up. Although he had staged his own death, he had not successfully covered his tracks. As he stepped off the ferry here in Dover, he was met by counterterrorism officers. He has now pleaded guilty to charges, including attending a terrorist training camp and possessing a weapon for the purposes of terrorism. But it was his enthusiastic work as a PR man for Islamic state that caused the greatest harm. The group is still pumping out its propaganda, trying to add to the 600 Britons who have already travelled to Syria to fight. Frank Gardner joins me. Frank Gardnerjoins me. Put this into context. It’s a significant case for a number of reasons. He was one of the most violent British jihadists to go out there. He was involved with a very violent group of blood-thirsting group. They are close to IS so he’s one of the closest people to be involved with IS to go through the British courts. He and the people with him had quite a big significant influence on attracting other Britons to come out there. They also had this deception plan, this false rumour that he died in order to get him back here. It’s not clear why he wanted to come back. It could be that he was fed up or planning something. We don’t know. But this morning the outgoing head of the Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, he left two years ago, he gave his first public talk since leaving and he was asked whether he thought it was inevitable there would be a terrorist attack and he said, out of all the people who come back, the hundreds, most of them aren’t going to offend, but there is a small minority who probably will want to and it’s inevitable that eventually an attack will succeed. japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has said a threat by Islamic State militants to kill two japanese hostages is unforgivable. An online video has been released which shows a masked jihadi, speaking with an English accent, threatening the lives of two men, unless a ransom of $200 million is paid. Mr Abe called for the captives to be released immediately, saying the world will not give in to terrorism. Our correspondent, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, has more details. This man is a well-known freelance japanese filmmaker and last seen crossing the border last October. He was believed to be on his way to interview members of Islamic State. Haruna Yukawa is a self-styled military contractor. Some have called him a fantasist or war tourist. Videos on his website show him in northern Syria dressed in combat fatigues and carrying an assault rival. The threat to keel-- rifle. The threat to kill these men is clearly designed to upset the japanese people. It has demanded $200 million and that’s exactly the same figure pledged byjapan’s Prime Minister in non-military aid to countries that are fighting against Islamic State. The japanese Government has made it clear it will not give into terror and on a trip tojerusalem Mr Abe angrily not give into terror and on a trip to jerusalem Mr Abe angrily dejected the demand. TRANSLATION: This is unforgivable and Ifeel a the demand. TRANSLATION: This is unforgivable and I feel a strong resentment. I strongly demand the Islamic State group does not hurt the two japanese citizens and immediately releases them. According to western analysts, the video is designed to create fear in people notjust injapan, but all countries involved in the night against Islamic State. We have seen with previous IS videos that they are really trying to get western audiences to turn against the governments and to force the government to stay out of the Middle East and to withdraw their support or participation in the military action in the region. The video has been running all day onjapanese television and is already having an impact. TRANSLATION: I have seen the pictures on the news. The fact that it has reached japan is really scary. Other countries, including France and Italy, are reported to have paid large ransoms for the release of hostages in Syria, although both have denied it. In the past, japan has handed over large sums of money to get its citizens back. But this time it’s different. First, the amount of money being demanded isjust so vast. But perhaps more importantly, these two men went to Syria willingly, knowing how dangerous it is and that is likely to mute public demands to get them back at any price. A male nurse has gone on trial accused of killing three patients and poisoning 18 others. Victorino Chua is said to have administered saline, contaminated with insulin, to patients at Stockport’s Stepping Hill Hospital. The prosecutor said the nurse’s actions made it a lottery as to who received the contaminated products. Our correspondent, judith Moritz, reports. Victorino Chua is said to have turned from a man who dedicated his life caring for others to harming them. He was a nurse at Stepping Hill Hospital near Stockport, and it’s alleged that in summer 2011 he turned poisoner. Tampering with bags of saline to be used as drips and contaminating ampoules. The jury heard he added insulin to them, with catastrophic results. Three people died. Tracy Arden was Ali, Arnold Lancaster, aged 71, and 83-year-old Derek Weaver. Another man was left with a brain injury and 17 other patients were poisoned but later recovered. The jury was told that he tampered with the solutions and then left them for other unwitting staff to use. Peter Wright OC said they had been like ticking time bombs waiting to be administered by unsuspecting staff to unsuspecting patients. He listened from inside the dock as the jury heard that staff had become suspicious and called the police. Security was tightened and in january 2012 he is alleged to have tried a new tactic. This time he altered medical notes so that the amount of drugs prescribed to patients was changed. The prosecution is saying he was again trying to poison patients, succeeding in one case. He faces 36 charges, including three of murder. He denies them all. His trial is set to last for four months. The Sun newspaper will no longer feature topless women on page three, according to its sister paper, The Times. Friday’s edition of the Sun was said to be the last that would carry the images, but they will continue online. Page Three has been a Sun feature for All years, but has been repeatedly criticised for being sexist and outdated. The parent company’s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, recently described the images as old-fashioned. Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, has the story. As the Sun headline might not have said, it’s the neple anies that won it. If the topless models brought a smile to your morning or made you cloak on your cornflakes, this morning bikinis were covering the parts that aren’t normally left to the imagination. Are you missing Page the imagination. Are you missing page three today? I want it back. For nick cla McClean, a page 3 girl for six years, not the news she wanted from the paper. This group of women who have got this hatred to page three. I thought we were fighting for women to do whatever they wanted to do, but now we have no choice, because they’ve taken this away from us. For the Sun the readership gave it two million reasons why it’s been able to ignore the critics, but perhaps the nudity averse sponsors, so is this really the campaigners victory? I can’t say it’s an amazing day for women and female representation in the media, because all they’ve done is stopped showing nipples but show women in underwear, say. Perhaps in this digital age the move was inevitable. Lucy from London will still be topless on the paper’s website. Page three has been a fixture since 1970, a year after Rupert Murdoch bought the paper. He hinted last year it’s time -- the paper. He hinted last year it’s time -- it’s time has come. At this building site we asked some of the readers. Are you going to stop buying it because they’ve got rid of the pictures? Definitely. It’s boring. It’sjust a bit of fun. You get a man and he’s in his speedos and have a topless bird, in not, keep everyone happy. You’re not going to miss it? No, not really, I’ve got a bird at home. I won’t need to look at that. The Sun won’t confirm it’s dropped it for good and they could surprise us tomorrow with a topless picture, but it’s always been a paper of its readers and if the readers don’t dessert it in droves will return. The politician feels vindicated. It’s a victory for women who are worth more Less you think about women the better. Look at her. Lucy seems to have been the very last one on a page that has split opinion. The long-awaited Chilcot Inquiry into Britain’s role in the Iraq War will not be published until after the general election. Sirjohn Chilcot, the inquiry chairman, is expected to confirm the decision tomorrow. The public inquiry was announced in 2009 by the Labour Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. The open sessions concluded nearly four years ago, since when there’s been persistent controversy about revealing sensitive in formation and the content of private conversations. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, is at Westminster. What do you make of this? What are the potential implications? The reason why this report has been delayed is for two reasons: One, there has been a long-standing row over what sensitive intelligence information could be revealed. There were tensions between the inquiry and the Cabinet Office, tensions over what American intelligence could be revealed. If they are going to be criticised by this inquiry, they will have a chance to respond to that saying that is not entirely clear. That process is still ongoing. The consequences mean that the growing public outcry at the delay will continue. The Prime Minister has expressed his frustration. MPs will debate this in Parliament next week. The Cabinet Secretary will be hauled before MPs. The election campaign will not now be dominated by endless questions about what Tony Blair said to George Bush all those years ago and that can only help the Labour Party. Thank you. In the next few hours, President Obama will deliver his penultimate State of the Union Address to the American people. He’s expected to outline a wide range of proposals, including tax rises for the wealthy. Mr Obama hopes the money generated will fund free community college education and the tripling of child tax credits. Congress - which is controlled by the Republicans - is unlikely to approve the measures, as our North America editor, jon Sopel, reports. President Obama is expected to throw down the gauntlet... The centrepiece of the political calendar. When the President sets out his plans for the coming year. Why wait to deliver the speech when social media is there to set the tone? I’m a little more relaxed and better at it... The White House has been doing just that with this YouTube video. How do we make sure that everybody in this country, how do we make sure they are sharing in this growing economy? The President’s answer to that is to push for major tax increases on the rich, raising $300 billion over ten years. He would hit the big financial institutions. He would raise Capital Gains Tax and close an Inheritance Tax loophole that only the wealthiest use. The beneficiaries will be communities like this. This is only two miles from the Capitol Building but it might as well be two million miles away. What do you think about Obama’s plan to tax the very rich? I like it. There are certain parts of Washington DC you can see still poverty, you know what I mean? It is hidden now because of the beautiful buildings they have built. A lot of people are starving. The President also wants to extend help to small businesses. Caroline runs a sandwich shop. She wrote to the President and has been invited to Congress tonight. I have benefitted from a small business loan and from stimulus money that paid for my costs. I wanted to thank the President for the things he had done. What normally happens is that the President goes off around the country to sell his policy and he is going to Idaho. Then to another state beginning with I - going to Idaho. Then to another state beginning with I - India. For that country’s Republic Day. That suggests this is more about starting a debate than seeing his tax proposals accepted lock, stock and barrel. That is because the President doesn’t have the votes. These men sitting either side of him do. They are the Republicans that run the Congress and they could kill this plan stone-dead. The strange thing is, it almost seems that the President is daring them to try. jon is at the US Capitol Building. Why would he pursue this if Congress won’t let him get his way? The President is trying to lay a trap for the Republicans. He says these proposals will only affect the wealthiest 1% of Americans. So, if the Republicans vote these proposals down, and we have had one senator saying this is class warfare that the President is waging, the President will be able to say the Republicans are the party of no. The Democrats are the party of the remaining 99%. And that, the President thinks, is a pretty good place for the Democrats to be coming UP place for the Democrats to be coming up to the election in 2016. Thank you very much. The World Wide Web Foundation - headed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee - the man who invented the Internet - has ranked the UK Government as the most open and transparent in the world. The table was compiled based on access to public data. But Sir Tim was critical of Britain’s record when it comes to surveillance. The announcement coincides with the BBC’s Democracy Day, marking the 750th anniversary of the first representative Parliament to gather at Westminster, as our home editor, Mark Easton, reports. The digital revolution promises to transform the way we are governed, allowing citizens to access data on every aspect of the state. The UK Parliament, it emerges, leads the world in digital openness and transparency but the man who made all of this possible, the inventor of the worldwide web and father of the digital age, says even data like postcodes is not yet freely available. You think that the postcode would be something that is a part of the open structure of the UK and it’s not, the postcodes are created by the Post Office. The Post Office is now an individual corporation so, ironically, just the list of places in the UK is not available openly for free on the web. Today’s report puts the UK ahead of Sweden and the US at the top of the open data league table. Data.gov.uk now lists details of tens of billions of pounds of Government expenditure, information updated almost daily. Ministers hoped that this website would inspire an army of armchair auditors to go through state spending line by line. But transparency is not the same as accountability. For example, we know DEFRA spent £5lIlI.88 on components for an in-house-built electronic fish measurement system. What we don’t know is whether that’s a bargain or a scandal. Data has inspired a legion of young software designers who, with the blessing of parliamentary authorities, are inventing tools to make sense of all the information. One of the things that MPs are trying to get Government to do is to make sure that data is produced in useable formats. just dumping data is not the answer. It ticks a box but it doesn’t do the job and we’ve got to make sure that that’s easily accessible. There are now hundreds of Whitehall civil servants with jobs described as digital or social media managers. Outside Government, investigative journalists and professional mischief-makers are probing the digital world. If something newsworthy is going on, or something embarrassing, somehow it gets lost and it’s going to happen next week, it’s published at the worst possible time, late on a Friday night, it’s on a document format that’s very difficult to find out, so there’s a false openness. There’s an irony in all this. The more institutions like Parliament open up to the digital revolution, the more it seems we distrust them. Mark Easton, BBC News, the Palace of Westminster. Countless tributes have been paid during the day to the actress Anne Kirkbride, who’s died at the age of 60. She played Deirdre Barlow - one of Coronation Street’s best-loved characters - for more than Ao years. Her colleague William Roache described her as a ‘loving and vibrant person’ who’ll be missed both on and off the screen, as our arts correspondent, David Sillito, reports. I hate this dump. I hate thejob. And I hate... Deirdre! Deirdre’s been part of life for many of us. I don’t want it at all. Anne Kirkbride was 17 when she first took on the role. I was down here for an audition for something but they said, ""While you’re here, just nip over to the Coronation Street office because they’re looking for someone to do three lines in the Street."" Same again? Not for me, thanks, I have to be off. So soon? Those three lines turned into the role of a lifetime. I just didn’t want to make a fool of myself. There were a number of on-screen relationships, but the heart of it was Ken and Deirdre - the Barlows. Very tough. Really tough. Actually, just walking in here now, very difficult because all of us wanted to carry on filming today, that’s a natural feel for Annie’s sake and all our sakes, but when it came to it, we couldn’t do it. So much has happened in this little house over the years and for fans who have been visiting today, a little moment to reflect back on more than Ao years of TV history. What was it you liked about Deirdre? She was a character, weren’t she? We could relate to her as ourselves. That realism is a key part to it and that’s why people seemed to love her so. I met her a couple of times in real life. Yeah, I liked her very much. OK, Deirdre, come on. What are you doing? The prison episodes provoked words of support from the Prime Minister. These were some of British TV’s most watched moments. Why did you put the phone down on me? The love triangle with Mike Baldwin - the crowd at Old Trafford had to be kept up-to-date. It flashed up on the screen at Old Trafford and it said ""Deirdre goes back to Ken"" and they all went boo, boo! Anne’s real-life marriage began with this on-screen romance. She had her struggles - cancer, depression - but she was always grateful for Deirdre. The ups and downs, those glasses, the Street’s lost one of its stars. I’m going to miss her, definitely. Anne Kirkbride, who died yesterday. That’s all from us. Don’t forget Newsnight is over on BBC Two, but now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Riz Lateef. The former head of the secret intelligence service says that a terrorist attack here is, in his words, highly likely. Sirjohn Sawers said there are hundreds of people going out to Syria and Iraq and some will return and pose a real threat. Let’s cross to Marc Ashdown who can tell us more. We’ve heard from the police, we’ve heard from the politicians, now finally, we’ve heard from the spymaster, the man who for five years was at the heart of operations here at MI6. He has seen events unfold in France and today gave his stark warning, a terror attack on the streets of Britain, is, in his opinion, all but inevitable. This month’s deadly terrorist attacks in Paris have increased fears as London as a target. Now the man who spent five years in the shadows has spoken publicly for the first time. Sir john Sawers retired in November. Today he warned the threat here has been growing steadily. If I was to sit here and say will the goalkeepers of the security services and the police keep every single attempt to get the ball into the net out, no, at some point the threats will get through and there will be another attack in this country. The conflicts raging in Iraq and Syria are pulling in thousands ofjihadist from across Europe. At least 300 people are thought to have been recruited from London. The former chief says constant vigilance is needed when they return here. There will be a hardened core who are absorbed into extremist ideology and training and who will pose a real threat here. Impossible, he said, to monitor the activities of potential terrorists without intruding on the lives of ordinary people, echoing the Prime Minister’s view there cannot be no-go areas when it comes to intelligence gathering. First, trust needs to be rebuilt. There needs to be new compact between the two sides if we are not to see events like we saw in Paris become more and more featured in our lives. In Belgium, the authorities say stopped a plot to murder police and in Germany there have been raids on individuals suspected of extremist links. Now the former head says everything should be done to stop this terror coming to our streets. The key politics is how that policing is achieved. Sirjohn says there shouldn’t be no-go areas in the communities and the same should be said of technology, phones, on-line, the spies should be able to snoop on communications. That could be spying on innocent people. It is, he said, a dilemma and it’s controversial, we know that and it’s an interesting and influential voice. A cyclist has died after being hit by a lorry in North London. It happened on Amhurst Park, in Stamford Hill at around 8.00am this morning. Police and ambulance crews attended the scene but the cyclist died a shortly after. Police in Croydon say they’re looking for a woman suspected of breaking into the home of a dementia sufferer and stealing her belongings. The woman is believed to have robbed the 80-year-old a number of times over the last few weeks at her home in South Norwood. This footage was taken on a camera installed by the pensioner’s family after they became suspicious. A mother claims her three-year old daughter was left fighting for her life, after being treated at Watford Hospital. Bella Leach has leukaemia and was admitted for tests. Her family say while she was there she developed a serious blood infection. The NHS Trust involved denies this claim, but has admitted it didn’t care for Bella properly and has launched an investigation. ",,
118,BBC1 London,22-jan-2015,BBC London News,18:30,30 mins,True,"Recognise these London Djs? The trio who could be the biggest musical export you’ve never heard of. Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. A Hammersmith-based firm has become the first UK technology company to reach a valuation of a billion dollars. Shazam is a mobile app which uses audio recognition technology to help people identify music. It attracts more than 100 million monthly users, and accounts for around 10% of all digital music sales. Industry experts say the company’s global success is a significant milestone, which can be credited to the huge pool of talent in the capital. Asad Ahmad reports. It could be any office practically anywhere in London, but it is not. It is the nerve centre of a billion-dollar tech business. What are they doing looking at their screens that is changing the way the music industry works. This. It started by simply being able to identify music but no advertising music services. They are proud to always make their own tea. London is extremely multicultural and that is of huge benefit to us in terms of building ourteam and of huge benefit to us in terms of building our team and finding the best talent. The one thing I would say is London has helped us retain the talent. Retaining talent in an office with facilities like this in one of the world’s most exciting cities is how it is done. It means the 150 staff here are proud of what they have achieved and where they have done it. London is a great place for a music company or a tech company to exist. London is very much an international hub so we can travel to Europe and places like Russia. London’s talent has produced its first billion-dollar tech business and there are hopes its success will be replicated. The hope is this will give London a big boost. There are loads of tech companies and start ups in Croydon and elsewhere and this could be only the beginning. Despite its phenomenal success, injust the beginning. Despite its phenomenal success, in just over a decade, phenomenal success, injust over a decade, Shazam says it will not be moving to the states just yet because its growth can continue just as strongly in London. Coming up, revelations that all on Morgan has been the victim of a blackmail attempt. Residents in north London have accused Barnet Council of social cleansing because of plans for a multi-million pound redevelopment of their estate in West Hendon. They claim it’ll force out hundreds of low income families. And tonight campaigners are protesting outside the local Town hall. Our reporter Nick Beake is also there. They are making their views extremely clear tonight. There is a late setting of a public inquiry looking at this. Right across the capital, we have seen the conflict between communities and developers and everyone agrees more housing is neededin and everyone agrees more housing is needed in London but what format that takes and that’s what cost to the local community, that is highly contentious. Building a brighter future or ripping at the heart of the community. The West Hendon estate is being knocked down block by block and replaced by 2000 new flats. The is not one for this man. Once home I see has been here for six years but Barnet council says there will not be room for unsecured or temporary tenants. It is a fine community and there are loads of friends and the support network like doctors and GPs and all sorts. I would rather be part of the regeneration. Residents are also angry there will only be 250 flats for social housing, lower than first promised and about half of what is your note. It is notjust some council tenants who say they are being forced out. Some leaseholders who bought their houses during the 1980s say they are now being priced out because of this. The 71-year-old man is being forced to sell her toes and says the £175,000 he has been offered is well below market value and half the selling price of the replacement. Despicable. They tell you nothing and just make an offer and you can take it or leave it. That is the impression they get. This evening residents marched to the public inquiry, looking at the way Barnett has used compulsory purchase orders to make people sell. Pro-testers claim it the midst of social cleansing but the council leader denies both the authority and developers have put profit before people. I am convinced this will be a good result for all the people in Barnet particularly on the estate and that is why we are doing it. The buildings need rebuilt and the way you do it is you put in private housing which pays for rebuilding. The council insists more tenants on secured agreements will have a home and home owners can buy share ownership flats helped by compensation money. These campaigners will be heading inside in the next few minutes and some will be speaking as part of the enquiry. It is due to end next Friday and the inspector will go away and consider all the evidence and come back with the recommendation but ultimately this decision will be made by the Communities Secretary. It is often our first point of call but a GP surgery in Berkshire has been placed in special measures. The practice is failing on the number of fronts including infection-control. It is one of only three to require such sanctions. The surgery on Priory Avenue has been looking after the residents since 1900. Now the current practice need some attention. It can be really difficult to get an appointment in the morning. Sometimes I phone up at 8am and I find that they are all gone. People keep leaving because they are not happy. If you want to book an appointment it can be three weeks in advance. The government’s health watchdog agrees and says the practice has problems in 14 key areas including not enough staff to look after the patients and patient records not being updated and insufficient infection-control and lack of a cleaning schedule. The practice is run by a company of GPs called specialist health services. It was graded inadequate in several categories including being safe, effective and well led, but were patients ever press? The report says that we treat patients with compassion, dignity and respect, and at the end of the day that is what clinical carers about, so we are providing that. The practice says it is into a programme of change but as only one of the UK wide to be given such a bad bill of health that will be subject to future examinations. We have sanctions and can seek immediate closure but didn’t feel the need to end this situation. That would be action we take very really. A team from the Royal College of General practitioners will now oversee the required changes. The taxpayer will pay for some of that but the message from the surgery is for the sake of its patients it will get better. A young backpacker from south London has been found dead on the Thai Island where two other Britons were killed last year. The victim’s been named online as 23-year-old Christina Annesley from Orpington. She was found on Koh Tao- the same island where Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were killed last September. The police say they’ve not found any signs of violence and at this stage they do not believe anybody else was involved involved in A Metropolitan police officer has been cleared of assaulting a woman at Great Ormond Street Hospital. PC Warren Luke, seen here arriving at Wood Green Crown Court wearing glasses, had been accused of punching and kicking a mother, who was visiting her severely disabled daughter in a children’s ward just over a year ago. This afternoon a jury found him not guilty. Scotland Yard says it’ll now review any potential misconduct. A travellers group has called on the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to stand down after a court found he’d unlawfully discriminated against Romany gypsies wanting pitches in the green belt. Ajudge said human rights were breached by ""calling in"" cases normally considered by planning inspectors. His test-case ruling was a victory for two Romany Gypsies, one under threat of eviction from a site in Bromley, South east London. Katharine Carpenter has the story. This for five years, this woman has been trying to get planning permission for her mobile home and caravan on this land. A disabled single mother, she has gone through numerous appeals and faced eviction but now a High Courtjudge has ruled she has been treated unfairly and unlawfully by the government. This case has not been about the rights and wrongs of building on the green belt but about how planning appeals have been dealt with. Normally, planning inspectors handle the vast majority of appeals, but towards the end of 2013, Eric Pickles was having all cases where travellers wanted to live on the green belt referred directly to him. It meant the appeals were taking far longer than the judge said that was racial discrimination. Although she didn’t want to appeal on camera, as she said she was over the moon but some supporters angry. It is notjust these families. This is maybe as many as 100 applications and it seems like they are totally unrepentant and nobody will take responsibility. I don’t know of any job where you can be found to be discriminated against a race of people and still keep yourjob. The government told us it wouldn’t apologise for trying to safeguard the countryside. The Bromley MP says Eric Pickles is right to remain defiant. Most people will be outraged and say it indicates how the legal system can be out of touch and white as a public body bringing litigation which gets away from the rights of the vast majority? This test case paves the way for others still waiting for an appeal decision to challenge the Secretary of State, who is not expected to appeal the findings. Residents in Surrey whose homes were affected by flooding last year are being asked for their views on how the experience affected them. Researchers from King’s College London are sending questionnaires to home owners to assess the impact on their health and well-being. Gareth Furby reports. BY By the river during the floods. Now of course it is a different place, but experts want to know if anyone has been left with long-term effects on their health. A very wet floor, still drying out even though. This woman has been sent the questionnaire but says she survived unscathed. I haven’t been depressed at all. And if anything she enjoyed the company. It was nice meeting neighbours. You canjust see the bungalows. Butjust up neighbours. You canjust see the bungalows. But just up the bungalows. Butjust up the road, this couple admit they are little bit more anxious now. They had to be evacuated. You are worried every time it rains. I know one of our neighbours is moving because his wife is extremely anxious about the letter. After 21 years by the lover, this couple are thinking of selling up. It makes you live without trust. We have lived here and enjoyed it very much but now there is always, will it be all right now? This study is essential in helping us understand how people are affected by flooding. The plan is it could mean a better response to the next flight, but for this AVI, there are quite a few suggestions. Nobody rang us to say, are you all right or anything like that. Nobody came to check we were all right. No one at all. We didn’t see anyone. The couple have already installed a few makeshift flood defences but they are hoping the River Thames stays within its banks this winter. Aftera 3,000 mile swim in international waters, the problems facing eels in the River Brent. The England and Wales Cricket Board has revealed that Middlesex batsman Eoin Morgan recently received a blackmail demand. Morgan is to captain England’s one-day squad in next month’s world cup. We are talking about Eoin Morgan who we understand was targeted by an alleged blackmail plot following a brief relationship with a woman in Australia. He is currently in Australia himself and while he was out there and it is understood he received an e-mail demanding a 5 figure sum to prevent the story coming out in the newspaper. The man has been named then the Australian media and it is thought to be the woman’s current boyfriend but he has since apologised. How much has this impacted on the England preparations? He will have a bit more Mickey taking and sledging but this all happened a long time ago. This is alleged to be over five years ago and the England Cricket board said, As stated, England and Australia the next match. And good luck to Eoin Morgan and the team. You have been speaking to some netball players who have had a rough year? Not going too well for Surrey Storm, who got all the way to the final only to lose for the third time. Netball had a special year-end 2014 evenif Netball had a special year-end 2014 even if England failed to win a medal at the Commonwealth. But that wasn’t the only court drama. Surrey Storm made it to their third super league final only to lose again to Manchester in dramatic fashion. To go unbeaten until the last 30 seconds of one game wasn’t a disastrous season but it was frustrating because I think we should have won. It was a dramatic end to an amazing season. It took a while to get over, and even in the final we didn’t play badly. To aid their recovery they have made an impressive new signing, England captain Pamela Cook regarded as one of the best call attacks in the world. When she said she wanted a challenge, I was straight into the office. You cannot replace someone of that quality. Not only have ability but what the name means to the fans and players. While silverware has eluded them, when it comes to a business, they are the best in the super league. The only team to have sold out all their home games for the last three seasons. A pattern repeated that the Commonwealth. When netball sold out so fast they moved the finals to a bigger venue. There was frustration not to get a medal but to see the quality onshore, and that will continue to grow. The sport is growing. With the netball World Cup this year, the standard is only expected to grow. Next, the efforts to protect the capital’s eel population. They face a two year trek from the western Atlantic to estuaries like the Thames, 20 years in rivers and then another long journey back to the sea to breed. With numbers falling, environmentalists have created a new pass in the Grand Union Canal in West London to make their journeys a little bit simpler. Yvonne Hall explains. just a few centimetres long but these young eels are driven to complete an incredible journey from the Atlantic Ocean to freshwater rubbers and Europe. The trouble is when they try to swim up the River Thames, they meet hundreds of obstacles. Environmentalists are giving them a helping hand. While we cannot alter all the environmental impacts that see we can create a better environment in these rubbers, and in London alone there are over 2000 obstructions which stop eels coming up into the freshwater. Here on the Grand Union Canal, a new you’ll pass is being installed. The old one was damaged by flood water. We are installing a brand-new elver pass and we’re trying to help them migrate past obstructions. These tiny little elvers cannot climb up the walls so we have to help them. This is an adult European eel and this new pass will hopefully see thousands of young eels come here to travel to the freshwater and there could be 120,000 young eels are riding over the next few weeks. When they get here, they will only be seven centimetres long but they will have already made an incredible journey of more than 3000 miles. They start life in the Sargasso Sea and swim 3000 miles to Europe to travel up estuaries including the River Thames. The growth of about 20 years and if they are lucky enough not to end up as food, they make the 3000 mile journey back to the Atlantic. The number of European eels in London has fallen by 90% and it is now a critically endangered species. It is hoped this reinforced pass will help stop the decline. They might not be a London band you recognise, but don’t worry, that’s because they’re probably the biggest musical export you’re least likely to have heard of. Above and Beyond have built an empire selling their unique brand of electronic dance music to the world, without the help of major labels. Our Entertainment Correspondent Brenda Emmanus has been to meet the trio, and given what they do, there are some flashing images in her report. johnny, a seasoned musician, and Tony, a marketing expert. Together they are Above and Beyond, one of the most successful London bands you’d probably never heard of unless you are into electronic music. The band are an independent success story who over 15 years have built to record labels, have regular radio show syndicated globally and have sold over1 million records and chuckin sold over1 million records and chuck in around 150 Dj gigs around the world. We are more like a bank that Djs and most successful Djs are similar, doing mostly their own music. We are a new band hybrid for a new electronic music age. It all started when they met at the University of Westminster and were joined by Tony, a marketing executive at a record label. They were all keen on producing dance music. You shunned the traditional route so what was the secret of your success? It was through rejection that we learn is to survive on our own. That has been the key. We had to build things by ourselves rather than relying on major-label cooperation. From the studio in Bermondsey, the grip produced their own music while building a fan base saw impressive they were the first British Djs to headline and sell-out Madison Square Garden. I am really happy with not only how it turned out but the stuff we learned along the way. We are coming to play Brixton Academy in April so all the stuff we learned preparing for Madison Square Garden, we can now really do those kinds of shows better. The three Musketeers may now have two relinquish their anonymity with their new album in the top ten and forthcoming dates that Brixton Academy already sold out. Time for a check on the weather with Helen Willetts. The weather can’t seem to make up its mind. We will have the seesaw continuing. I sure do this yesterday and there was a lot more clouds around but actually we have had quite a nice day, not too warm, around three Celsius. Already, the temperature around freezing and it will continue to drop through the evening and overnight. We could see some mist and fog coming but more likely to have a hard frost. The temperatures lower than last night. In the rural areas we could see minus five Celsius and it will take a long time tomorrow for the frost to left, but for most of us, the sunshine should last into the afternoon. The temperature might do a little better tomorrow. Through tomorrow evening and overnight, we will see a splash or two of rain. A bit of fog over the Downs and that is because of this weather front which will get heavy rain further north. After things turning milder, by the weather system it will turn colder. For Saturday, a Reg of high unsettled conditions. This wedge of mild weather coming and frauds Sunday and the start of Monday. As headed, the seesaw of whether so a bright and crisp day, possibly I say to start with, but otherwise a lovely, sunny day. Not hard frost but around seven Celsius. Sunday will be different and it may start bright, but on the whole, the cloud will increase with the temperature picking up. A tale of two halves into the weekend. Crisp and chilly weather with a keen breeze and the flip side is we get more cloud on Sunday but it will be milder. For me, bright and crisp winds out but not looking too bad. The main headlines. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon has claimed there’s been a ""significant watering down"" of proposals to give the Scottish Parliament more powers. The Prime Minister has defended the new draft legislation. Tributes are being paid to the former Conservative Home Secretary Leon Brittan, who’s died at the age of 75. His family say he passed away at home last night following a long battle with cancer. More than a trillion euros will be created by the European Central Bank and injected into the Eurozone economy in a bid to revive it. The technique - known as quantatitive easing - has been widely expected. That’s it for now. Asad Ahmad will be back with our late news. From me and the the team here though - thanks for watching and have a lovely evening. conducting all nine Beethoven symphonies MUSIC: Beethoven’s Symphony No 3 In E-Flat Major (Eroica) 2rd Movement, 3rd Theme Celebrating Simon Rattle in Radio 3 Dimensions, conducting all nine Beethoven symphonies with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, broadcast for the first time.

Tonight, on the One Show, we’re hosting a self-portrait competition and have gathered some inspiration from the masters.

119,BBC1 London,22-jan-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at ten, the former Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, who’d faced allegations of improper conduct in office, has died. He was one of the key Conservatives of the 1980s and spent a decade as a European commissioner. But more recently he’d faced questions over his handling of child abuse allegations during his time in office. His friends have defended his reputation. He told the truth which was that he behaved exactly as one should have done as Home Secretary and the innuendos were totally without foundation. Many tributes have been paid during the day, but some MPs say there are unanswered questions. Also tonight, Prince Andrew has publicly denied claims by an American woman that she was forced to have sex with him when she was 17. Kickstarting the economy of the Eurozone, the European Central Bank will inject more than 1 trillion euros to stimulate activity. In West Africa, some pupils return to school as the spread of Ebola seems to be slowing. And, it’s Britain’s biggest prize for modern art, we reveal the winner. Tonight on BBC London, the music tech firm working from its office in Hammersmith is valued at a billion dollars. And the Mayor makes a surprise visit to Iraq to meet British troops helping to train local fighters. Good evening. Leon Brittan, who served as Conservative Home Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, has died. He was 75 and had been suffering from cancer. Lord Brittan, who also served as a European commissioner, was described by David Cameron as a ""dedicated and fiercely intelligent public servant"". Lord Brittan’s name was back in the headlines last year when he faced questions about his handling of child abuse allegations during his time in office. Our political correspondent Carole Walker has more details. Lord Brittan had a long and distinguished political career. He was back at the centre of controversy last year amidst questions over his handling of allegations of sexual abuse when he was Home Secretary 30 years ago. But today there was praise for his achievements. I particularly want to pay tribute to him as a former member of this house and former Home Secretary and he was a kind, assiduous and brilliant man. He had had a meteoric rise to become the youngest Home Secretary since Winston Churchill when he joined Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet in 1983. These were turbulent times. During the miners’ strike he took a tough stance, condemning the National Union of Mineworkers. The one way which we cannot allow, in a democracy, that an industrial dispute should be resolved should be on the basis of violence and on the basis of action in breach of the criminal law. He was a very brilliant person, I would say the outstanding figure of his generation intellectually. He would have risen to the top of any field in which he decided to make a career and it wasn’t at all surprising that he became Home Secretary at a very young age. A pro-European, Leon Brittan spent a decade as an EU commissioner in the 1990s at the heart of the battle over Britain’s relationship with Europe, as difficult then as they are today. He was a dedicated public servant. He served his country in Europe but I think perhaps most of all he was part of that Margaret Thatcher government that did so much to turn our country round in the 1980s and he played a key role in that. It was when he was Home Secretary that he was handed a dossier by the late Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens, alleging that prominent people were paedophiles. He denied claims he had failed to deal adequately with the allegations. There’s going to be a statement at lunch time. He said he had passed the documents to the relevant Home Office officials. Last year he was also questioned by police about the alleged rape of a woman in 1967, a claim he said was wholly without foundation. But his social links with the former Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf forced her to stand down as chair of an inquiry into historic child sex abuse which remains on hold. Not only is it a sad day for Leon Brittan’s family, it is also a sad day for the survivors of child sex abuse because they would have wanted to hearfrom Sir Leon Brittan at this inquiry in terms of what he knew about the allegations that were made during the 1980s. Tributes have flowed today with politicians of all parties praising Leon Brittan’s grasp of detail, his intellect and his integrity. Carole Walker, BBC News. With me now is Tom Symonds. A lot of tributes to his ability but still quite big concerns in some quarters. Lord Brittan has died leaving questions unanswered which is unsettling for people who have suffered from child abuse. The allegation that he was given the names of prominent paedophiles and didn’t handle that properly is very serious and he has always vehemently denied it. Butl serious and he has always vehemently denied it. But I have spoken to someone directly connected with the government’s forthcoming child abuse inquiry and they will-- government’s forthcoming child abuse inquiry and they will -- they say it will take about five years to get to the bottom of it but this is a question at the centre of their work. Being quite reach is frankly a shambles, there is no chair, there are public rows between members of an advisory panel set up to look into the inquiry. Meetings are being postponed. By chance, the Home Secretary today said that within the next few weeks she would make a statement that moved all this along but the problem is that we are talking about offences that may have gone back to the war and memories are fading. People who might have been abuses are coming to the end of their lives and someone who is investigating allegations, I can tell you that people not having memories any more about this stuff is a real problem. The government is under great pressure to get this moving. Thank you. Prince Andrew has publicly denied allegations that an American teenager was forced to have sex with him when she was 17. He made the denial during a visit to the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied the allegations, as our royal correspondent Peter Hunt reports. A prince under pressure, an entourage keen to protect him from the inevitable questions. Can you recover from this, sir? This morning, the Prince’s mind was clearly on what was to come later. After two unprecedented denials, a third attempt by the Prince himself to make clear he is not guilty as alleged. Firstly, I think I must and want, for the record, to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks. And Ijust wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace. My focus is on my work. The claims of this woman, Virginia Roberts, have been denying him that focus. In a sworn court document she says she called the senior royal Andy. The beleaguered Prince is not without supporters. I’m not going to comment on matters which are clearly for others to comment on, I’m a business representative and I’m simply saying that the business community knows the contribution he’s made to the health of the British economy. In 2001, aged 17, Virginia Roberts alleges and the Prince denies she had sex with him in London. Still 17, she said it happened again in New York. When she was around 18, she claims she and the Prince took part in an orgy in the US Virgin Islands, something Andrew insists did not take place. She is not alleging in the latest papers that all this happened when she was a minor and under age. Lawyers forjane Doe 3, as she’s known in court, have sent Prince Andrew a letter which they say has been returned, asking to talk to him as a witness, not a suspect. It reads... And this man, jeffrey Epstein, is the person Virginia Roberts accuses of forcing her to have sex with the Prince. Those are not my words, I apologise. The American financier is here objecting to a line of questioning from a lawyer. Epstein went to jail after pleading guilty to procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. After his release, the convicted sex offender was photographed with Prince Andrew. Of late he’s not had many reasons to be cheerful. For three weeks, Prince Andrew has been confronted by these allegations and renewed questions about his judgement. Peter Hunt, BBC News, Davos. Kamal Ahmed was at the event earlier, can you shed any more light on what went on? I think he was attempting to give this message to the right audience. He would like to be seen as somebody who brings you this is together, creates investment and wealth, jobs, that’s why he chose Davos. I was asked to be involved in this event many weeks ago before these latest allegations came out. Through that I got to spend some private time with the juke after the event. My impression is that however you ask about the allegations, whatever questions you put to him, he is resolute he will add no more to the emphatic denials that have been put out by Buckingham Palace and buy him. He wants to try to move on and doing it in front of Davos and business leaders, he felt he needed to be seen to be saying something about the allegations and he hopes that it puts it in the right context. He will try and move on and leave these allegations behind him to an extent. Thank you. The European Central Bank is to inject 60 billion euros a month into the economy of the Eurozone. It’s hoped the initiative, known as quantitative easing, will kickstart the weakest economies in the EU and stimulate business activity. The programme will start in March and last for 19 months. The USA and the UK have both used the method to restore stability after the global financial crash of 2008. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston reports from the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. Money, euros, the European Central Bank today decided there’s not enough of them so it’s creating more than 1 trillion new euros to add some oomph, it hopes, to the Eurozone’s flat-lining economy. For this man, the European Central Bank’s President Mario Draghi, it was his biggest, boldest attempt yet to get money flowing again to the businesses and consumers who badly need it. Businesses like this struggling Spanish distributor of cables. With a business plan or a good idea it would be impossible to have access to the credit at the moment. The banks in Spain, they don’t want to accept any risk at all. 60 billion euros of new money will be created, magiced up, every month by the European Central Bank. Those euros will then be used to buy bonds, debts, IOUs, with much of the buying being done by central banks in national capitals and they will mostly be buying government bonds. Now, with all these new euros being created, money and credit becomes cheaper. That means lower interest rates for the government, businesses and households. And with the euro falling in price relative to other currencies, Eurozone exports become cheaper in foreign markets. All of which should give the Eurozone’s economy a bit of a boost. What is the verdict of the Finance Minister of Italy which is still in recession? Is your view that Mario Draghi and the European Central Bank have been ambitious enough? It’ll be a key element of a strategy, it will push away any risk of deflation which is there, it will provide an injection of confidence to markets, it will boost liquidity with companies and households. But this is just one element of the strategy, we need to do more and use all the other policy tools we have at our disposal. But what’s wrong is not just about a shortage of cheap money, some of the Eurozone’s big members have private sectors seen as weak and public sectors seen as bloated and what’s wrong there matters to the UK and its Chancellor. How big a contribution to the Eurozone recovery, a recovery which plainly matters to us since it’s still our biggest export market, how big a contribution do you think to that recovery this programme of QE will make? I think the central bank can help but it is not, by itself, enough. We have had help in the past from our central bank but we accompanied that with a clear economic plan. So on the European continent we have, yes, action from the European Central Bank, but what we need to see is the countries of the European continent taking action to make their economies stronger alongside that. So, a bit of an uphill struggle for the Eurozone? When QE first started in the UK and US, it was like a powerful antibiotic designed to cure a really serious problem. Today in the Eurozone and maybe over the last year or so injapan it’s a bit like an addictive painkiller, it’s nice to be on but doesn’t necessarily cure the underlying disease. At the top of a Swiss mountain where political and business leaders are meeting at the World Economic Forum there is a hope that all this money creation will cause a thaw in the Eurozone’s long, cold winter. Robert Preston, BBC News in Davos, Switzerland. David Cameron has welcomed the publication of draft legislation on the transfer of new powers to the Scottish Parliament. Proposals on spending, welfare and tax were drawn up by after last year’s referendum on independence. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says the original proposals have been watered down. Our Political Editor Nick Robinson reports from Edinburgh. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is’s the most powerful of them all? The Prime Minister is back in Scotland for the first time since the referendum. He may have won the vote on independence, she may have lost it but Scotland’s First Minister and the SNP look like they are winning the political debate. This document spells out draft new laws to give new powers to the Scottish Parliament. He says it delivers the vow made to Scotland by the three big Westminster parties. Scotland spoke. We listened. And now here we are delivering. Whoever forms the UK Government, after May 7th, these new powers are guaranteed. The Scottish Parliament will have more control of its tax and spending, making it one of the most powerful, devolved parliaments in the world. The referendum and this document were meant to settle Scotland’s future. Isn’t it true the debate rages and you are losing it to Nicola Sturegon? Many people said - Nicola Sturegon? Many people said - put it off, don’t take the risk, don’t let this happen on your watch. I believe in making proper, long-term decisions for the future of our country. We held the debate, we held the vote and in my view, those people making the strongest argument to keep our family of nations together won, that is who I see as winning the debate. But it’s Nicola Sturegon, who leads the Scottish Parliament, with a poll rating of over 50% - a rating fuelled by anger. We don’t have Labour or the Tories with the gumption to stand up here and say that the vow has been delivered because they know it’s not. She believes that Westminster’s promises have been broken. In some key respects, there has been a significant watering down of what the Smith Commission proposed. Before a change such as the abolition of the bedroom tax can be introduced by this Government, the Secretary of State at Westminster has to give his or her agreement. That’s an argument that will rage here from now until general election day. So, who do voters in Edinburgh believe is winning? Who’s winning the argument about Scotland’s future, him or her? Her. She is winning? Yes. She lost the referendum. She didn’t lose the referendum - well I suppose you could say she did lose the referendum. How is she winning the argument? Because shejust sounds How is she winning the argument? Because she just sounds so much more convincing than David Cameron. Well, I only hope that David Cameron is, to be perfectly truthful. Is he, though? The referendum is over, it sounds at times as if the SNP are winning the argument? Well, I would tend to agree with you, but I sincerely hope not. Of course, the big battle for political power in Scotland doesn’t involve the Tories. The other key player is the new leader of Scottish Labour, jim Murphy. This is modern home rule delivered, the vow everyone spoke about being achieved. This is an important day for Scotland. We have more power than ever before in our great country but I want to go further. These proposals claim to give an enduring settlement to the people of Scotland. Here, though, many don’t think they’ll endure beyond the general election. If you thought the question was all over - If you thought the question was all over - think again. David Cameron came here today with plans for Scotland which were, he claimed, built to last. Which way are we heading now? ""Which way are we heading now"", he asks. Who knows. Broadcasters are to publish revised plans for televised election debates, this time including the SNP, Plaid Cymru, and the Greens. They would join the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems and Ukip in seven-way debates. Other debates would involve fewer participants. David Cameron had previously said he would not take part in debates without the includion of the Greens. Our deputy political editor james Landale has spent the day with the Greens campaigning in Bristol and he joins us now. What do you make of the talk of a new shape and new form of debate? Well, five years ago it was quite simple. Three leaders, three debates, one of which took place just behind me here in Bristol. This time it is not so easy. The broadcasters said Nigel Farage of Ukip should be involved. David Cameron said, maybe but only if the Green leader, Natalie Bennett could take part. As a result the broadcasters have said they will bring forward a new set of proposals. One debate head-to-head between Cameron and Miliband and two debates with no fewer than seven party leaders. Not surprisingly the Greens, who I spent the day with, are delighted, as are Plaid Cymru and the SNP. Less happy are the DUP in Northern Ireland, they are saying, why couldn’t they take part and are writing to the broadcasters. The Conservatives are saying that David Cameron has been proved right. His critics are saying his bluff has been called and he has lost his excuse for not taking part. Bottom line, the negotiations are more complicated and there is no guarantee the debates will take place. Thank you. The World Health Organisation says the spread of Ebola in West Africa appears to be slowing, just over a year after the outbreak began. It says that fewer than 150 cases have been reported in the past week in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The latest outbreak has claimed almost 9,000 lives, as our global health correspondent Tulip Mazumdar reports. Retrieving the bodies of the Ebola dead. These scenes of loss and fear have become tragically familiar. But predictions of more than1 million people becoming infected by now, have thankfully not been fulfilled. The devastating spread of the disease has slowed and the epidemic has started to turn. We are beginning to see an overall decline in the number of new cases each week. The World Health Organisation has described this outbreak as the worst health emergency in modern times. The vast majority of cases have been in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, with a handful of infections elsewhere. The worst-affected has been Sierra Leone. When the virus was at its peak there were over 700 cases injust one week. Now the latest figures show 117 cases reported. That is a big drop but it’s still high compared to neighbour Liberia, which had only eight cases in seven days. Key to the fall in the number of new infections is communities understanding the virus. Wash your hands. We visited one awareness event in Sierra Leone last year, where people were told how to stop Ebola spreading. If people get comfortable and complacent, then it risks to flare back up. It is entirely possible, we are still in unchartered territory. This week schools reopened in Guinea, with extra health checks in place. It is a small but significant step on the road to recovery. The people of Greece will vote in a general election this weekend and the outcome could have a profound effect on the stability of the Eurozone. The radical left-wing party, Syriza, led by Alexis Tsipras, has a clear lead in the opinion polls. It’s promising to renegotiate the terms of the international bailout imposed on Greece after the financial crisis. Thousands of Syriza supporters have been taking to the streets of Athens. From there, our Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt reports. ""It’s time for the left"", they chant. Their leader is Alexis Tsipras, a former Communist. His radical left party, Syriza, could be on the verge of taking power in Greece, promising to renegotiate the bailout and that troubles Europe’s leaders. There are those, he said, prepared to surrender the country to Mrs Merkel, and our international creditors. These are the same people behind austerity. Greece’s debts have reached 320 billion euros. Alexis Tsipras wants help reducing them. His critics warn he could end up with Greece defaulting. There’s huge expectation here that the left will win and the change will come. Big promises are being made that the bailout could be renegotiated and that some of the debt could be restructured. The party’s lead in the polls has its roots in an economy which has shrunk 25% in five years. Take this make-shift pharmacy. 11,000 people have used it because they can’t afford health care. The pharmacy relies on donations of unused prescription drugs. This woman is here for her son. The injections he needs would cost 1+00 euros per month. Where am I meant to find this money? Good bless these people. This woman has a masters degree and has been looking for work for two years, she will be voted for Syriza. I’m not tired from austerity. I’m exhausted from austerity. Others doubt that Alexis Tsipras can renegotiate Greece’s bailout conditions. He thinks with victory he can persuade Europe to change, but on the other hand, we have all the eurozone officials and the IMF suggesting that unless you abide by your commitments, there is nothing to discuss. Tonight, Alexis Tsipras was in Athens. Europe might be about to witness the first anti-austerity party coming to power in the eurozone.

OK, so what is Artes Mundi? Well, it is a contemporary art prize, a bit like the Turner Prize, except there is a shortlist of ten artists, not four and they come from all around the world, not Britain and it doesn’t matter how old they are. The prize takes place every other year, not every year and it happens here n Cardiff. It is an amazing show. As many the artists point out, our generation are really having the best artists in this particular city is important. The line-up is impressive. A respected Croatian artist explores fascism with a surreal cabinet of stuffed donkeys. An Icelander, the chap in the bath, has won a lot of fan was his sadly romantic nine-screen film about the break-up of his marriage. The critical reaction to the open and innovative nature of Artes Mundi has been as positive as the response to this year’s Turner Prize was negative. Suggesting that the one-time bad boy of contemporary art prizes is being shown a thing or two by this less staid young pretender. And that’s all from us. Time now to join our news teams where you are. Good evening. I’m Asad Ahmad. London’s tech industry has been boosted by the news that a single firm based in Hammersmith has been valued at a billion dollars. It’s believed it’s the first time a British tech firm has broken the billion dollar barrier and it’s hoped it’ll give other companies here the confidence to stay in the capital. Earlier I went to Shazam’s headquarters in West London. It could be any office practically anywhere in London but it’s not. This is the nerve centre of a billion-dollar tech business just a couple of stops down the Piccadilly line. So what are they doing looking at their screens in West London which is changing the way the world’s music industry works? This. The app started by simply being able to identify music but now advertising, music sales and new services have taken the London business to a whole new level. But not too proud to always make his own tea in the offices in Hammersmith is the boss. London is certainly extremely multicultural and it is a huge benefit to us in terms of building our team, finding the best talent in the world. The one thing I would say though is that London has also helped us retain that talent. Retaining talent in an office with facilities like this within one of the world’s most exciting cities is how it’s done and it means the 150 staff here, many from London like Stephen from Romford, are proud of what they have achieved and where they have done it. London is a great place for a music company to exist and a tech company. We are really close to a lot of the major labels who have their international departments here and London is very much an international hub so we can travel to Europe, even places like Russia. I think there is a very innovative culture in London for sure. Now London’s talent has produced its first billion dollar tech business, there are hopes its success will be replicated. I hope this will give London a really big boost and the confidence of those other tech companies that are also working out there on Silicon Roundabout, there are loads of them. There are tech start-ups happening in Croydon near where I live as well. There’s a whole tech city idea starting up there. This could be only the beginning and I really hope it is. Despite its phenomenal success injust over a decade, Shazam says it won’t be moved to the States just yet. Instead, it says its growth can continue just as strongly right here in London. been restored to around 15,000 homes in south-west London which had been hit by a power cut.

Louisa. This trip to Iraq is being billed as a trade mission and also an opportunity for Borisjohnson to see the efforts made to counter ISS as a threat to terrorism. Other pictures that have come out are not exactly what you would expect to see from a diplomatic trip such as pictures of him holding an AK-l+7. These will only fuel criticism of the mayor for a trip some feel as no benefit to Londoners. Tonight a statement said... If he does become an MP in May, and he is still Mayor of London, there will be questions raised about whether he can do both jobs properly. Thank you. Campaigners have tonight protested against Barnet Council, who they say are guilty of what they describe as ""social cleansing"". The accusation comes after local authority plans to redevelop an estate in West Hendon were criticised for forcing out families on low incomes. Nick Beake has been speaking to some those effected. Building a brighter future or ripping out the heart of the community? The West Hendon estate is being knocked down block by block and replaced with 2000 new flats. There is not one for Alex Finney, though. Once homeless, he has been here for the past six years but Barnet Council says there won’t be room for unsecured or temporary tenants. I would like to stay in West Hendon because it’s a fine community and there is loads of friends and there’s a support network like doctors, GPs, friends and all sorts all in the area. I’d rather be part of the regeneration and stay on the estate. Residents are also angry there will only be 250 flats for social housing, lower than first promised and about half what is here now. It’s notjust some council tenants who say they are being forced out. Some leaseholders here who bought their council houses in the 1980s thanks to right to buy say they are now being priced out because of this development. 71-year-old joe Killeen is being forced to sell his house but says the £175,000 he has been offered is well below market value and half the selling price of the replacement flats. Despicable. They tell you nothing, theyjust make an offer, and it’s take it or leave it. That’s the impression they give us but were not taking it. This evening, residents marched to the public inquiry which is looking at the way Barnet has used compulsory purchase orders to make people sell. Protesters claim it all amounts to social cleansing but the council leader denies both the authority and developers, Barratt Metropolitan, have put profit before people. I am convinced this will be a good result for all the people in Barnet, particularly the people on the estate. That’s why we do it, you know. The buildings are grotty down there, they need rebuilding, there can be no doubt, and the way you rebuild an estate is you put in private housing which pays for the rebuilding. And the council insists all tenants on secured agreements will have a home here and home owners can buy shared ownership flats helped by compensation money. Time now for the weather with Peter and it is still chilly. Temperatures have already fallen below freezing. Watch out for some patchy fog as the night goes on. Temperatures down to around -5 or six in the countryside. Even in the centre of town, likely to have some frost. So time to scrape the windscreen first thing so the sun is UP windscreen first thing so the sun is up earlier and should clear the frost quite quickly. Freshening winds, temperatures about the same as today. Temperatures up and down over the weekend, Saturday will be sunny, Sunday rather cloudier. Now the national outlook. So far we have had a wintry theme to the weather this week but there are indications that we revert back to know two days being the same. We see the signs of moving into tomorrow. A cold start with rain later and that means that things turn a little milder. Already tempered is across England and Wales are falling sharply with some dense patches of freezing fog in some spots and a hard frost in the South. This front pushes into the far north-west preventing temperatures from falling below freezing but certainly we will be scraping the ice off the windscreens in the morning. A cold, frosty start, some heavy rain moving through Northern Ireland and Scotland and into northern England and the south-west, all the time accompanied by this milder flow. Temperatures in mid-afternoon of 9 degrees in the south-west despite the cloud and rain which pushes into the Midlands. East Midlands and East Anglia and the south-east have clearer skies and sunshine but it will still feel pretty cold around three degrees. Some sharp showers of behind the rain but mild in Northern Ireland and similarly in Scotland. Through the evening and overnight, those weather fronts move sharply south and east, bringing some heavy rain but allowing this high pressure to build and the air to come back from the north-west. A colder feel on Saturday, short lived, as the south-westerly flow returns on Sunday, milder, before a cold snap and the seesaw theme continues on Monday. Cold and frosty over the weekend, fine and dry with some wintry showers but temperatures back in single figures. Not as cold as earlier in the week. On Sunday, these fronts push in and Sam Wood between them, that is where it will stay pretty cloudy -- between them, that is where it will stay pretty cloudy -- sandwiched between them. Still a little on the chilly side in eastern England. In summary, not looking too bad, some dry weather on offer on Saturday but a cold and sunny day for most.

122,BBC1 London,25-jan-2015,BBC Weekend News,13:00,15 mins,True,"20 years of planning. 10 years experimenting. It all comes down to just one moment. Into battle we go. You are braver than me. I’m out, out, out. Dragon’s Den... I’m in. Good afternoon. The latest political defection from Ukip to the Conservatives has become mired in controversy. The Ukip leader Nigel Farage says he wished he’d sacked his defecting MEP Amjad Bashir sooner over a series of business and financial allegations. The MEP says he’s done nothing wrong and, in turn, has called Ukip a vanity project. Our Political Correspondent Alan Soady reports. Nigel Farage had proudly paraded Amjad Bashir when he joined the party and became its only Asian MP, helping to dispel an image of Ukip as a predominantly white party. Today was less of a laughing matter for the party leader who insists his decision to suspend Mr Bashir was nothing to do with the fact that he was just hours away from exiting Ukip. We’ve been increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the last few months, he didn’t tell us the truth about the employment of illegal immigrants in his business... He denies all of this. Well, I am afraid there is some strong documentary evidence and we have been investigating this, there are some open questions in Brussels about money. Bashir denies all the allegations Ukip has made and says he resigned because it is amateurish and lacks policies. It leaves the party without one of those who had held themselves up as proof Ukip is not racist. Nigel Farage says its party has plenty of other members from ethnic minorities. They are standing as Ukip candidates in local elections, we have got many standing in the general election. I think this idea, this attempt to paint Ukip as a racist party is dead. It is ultimately the decision for local people. In recent months, the defections have gone the other way with two MPs from the Conservative Partyjoining Ukip. The Conservatives say they are delighted with their newest recruit. We are absolutely satisfied that somebody who wants to see a referendum in Europe, wants to see control over immigration has found the right place to get that and that is in the Tory party because we are the only party that can deliver those things. This is what Nigel Farage wanted to focus on today, a pledge from Ukip to spend an extra £3 billion on the NHS. Instead, it has been overshadowed by the defection of an MEP who got tired of being in Ukip. Greeks are going to the polls today in crucial elections that will decide whether they stick with budget cuts or turn their back on austerity. The two leading parties, the centre right New Democracy and the left wing Syriza have radically different views on how the country should move forward with its pile of debt. Our Correspondent Mark Lowen is in Athens for us. Mark, Syriza still looking the likely victors? Yes, they are sensing this victory. There are undecided voters. Do they say better the devil you know? or will they leap into the unknown? The rush began early. A crucial investigation for a crisis hit nation. Some voted for the change they crave, others voted for stability. It could give hope to the next generation. I voted for New Democracy because I want something I know. Our country is ruined, our best scientists are leaving the country, we want change, we want clarity, we want hope. This man has a lot to smile about. The front runner, he says the time for the left has finished. He is talking of a challenge to Euro zone policy. The future for Europe is not a future of austerity, it is a future of democracy, solidarity and is cooperation. No such buzz around the Prime Minister. Antonis Samaras says Greece could leave the Euro. As a huge cost, the economy shrunk by a quarter. Many believe Greece must hold firm. This has become a referendum on austerity. Do Greeks vote to stick for the budget cuts and economic reforms or do they reject the orders from Brussels and Berlin and try something radically new? It is a battle between two different visions for the future of Greece and of Europe. For years since the Eurozone crisis erupted here, the shock waves from today could be dealt far beyond this tired country -- could be dealt far beyond this tired country -- four. A victory would make other antiestablishment parties across the UU resist Brussels and Berlin. Could today be the start of a change? -- EU. japan’s Prime Minister has said he believes an online video which claims one of the japanese hostages held by Islamic State militants has been killed, is genuine. Shinzo Abe said the killing of Haruna Yukawa had left him speechless. Our correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes is in Tokyo. So Rupert no offical confirmation that the video is genuine but no one seems to be saying otherwise now ? Yes. If you look at the language used by the Prime Minister, he thinks it is. He says, unfortunately at this point, we are analysing the valid city of this picture, and we believe it is valid. American security staff have also been looking at the video and pictures and believe it is true. The focus in japan is on looking at attempts to get the second japanese hostage free. They’re asking for ransom for his life but they are now asking for the release of a female suicide bomber. She is in prison injordan so japan has sent Foreign Minister tojordan to negotiate with the government, but I have to say, it seems very unlikely that the jordanian government will release this women are the prospects for the hostage remain bleak. Thank you. A fire has broken out on a cruise ship operated by the British based company Fred Olsen. It started early this morning in the engine room of the Boudicca which carries up to 800 passengers and is off the coast of Morocco. There are no reports of injuries and it’s reported the ship is back sailing under its own power. President obama is in India and in a break in protocol was met by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi personally at the airport, where the two leaders greeted with a hug. They are due to discuss trade, climate change, nuclear energy and counter-terrorism. Mr obama is the only US president to visit India twice during his term of office, saying he’s honoured to be back. A NASA spacecraft will today begin taking its first pictures of Pluto - after travelling nine years and 3 billion miles to get to the outer reaches of our solar system. It’s being billed as the last great planetary exploration of our Solar System, as our science correspondent Rebecca Morelle explains. A NASA spacecraft will today begin taking its first pictures of Pluto - after travelling nine years and 3 billion miles to get to the outer reaches of our solar system. This blurry picture is the best we have of Pluto. It is so far away we can’t make out any details. Compare that to the incredible views we now have of Mars. We’ve even spotted storms raging above the rings of Saturn. We have explored every planet in our solar system but not Pluto. Now, that’s about to change. NASA’s New Horizons mission blasted off in 2006. The fastest spacecraft ever launched, it’s travelled at record speeds to reach its target three billion miles away. Ever since the first planetary missions blasted into space, these alien worlds have continued to fascinate and amaze and now we are nearing the final frontier as Pluto gets ever closer. For the first time, we will be able to image this icy world in incredible detail. We know very little about Pluto, relatively speaking, and we want to know more about its surface, what it looks like and what its features are. It has just been a blur so far using the Hubble Space Telescope. Now we’ll be able to see features down to about the size of a swimming pool. Not that there is likely to be swimming pools on Pluto. Pluto, controversially stripped of its planetary status, is now called a dwarf world. However, scientists are excited. They will soon get their first glimpse of the frozen terrain and see Pluto’s giant moon up close. The probe is now ready to start taking images, gearing up for its flyby in july. Nobody knows what it will find but everything it sees will be a first. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. The next news on BBC one is at six o’clock, bye for now. Good afternoon. Around this weekend we have alternated between sunshine, cloudy skies, and we will follow that pattern for the next few days. By midweek, the air will get colder, strong winds will come down from the north and there will be snow in the forecast. Today, some bright spells through the East Midlands and the South East but for many it has been cloudy, and this afternoon we will continue to see the cloud moving south, along with patchy rain at first and a heavier band of rain clearing away from Scotland and Northern Ireland. Behind that, broken cloud mixed in with heavy, weak and showers, falling asleep or snow across higher ground. Colder towards the North on Monday, a touch milder in the South because we have the remains of this weather front. Through the first part of Monday morning, we are looking at cloud and rain for southern counties. Temperatures, having said that, at eight or 9 degrees. Broken cloud behind and some sleet or snow across higher ground. Heavy showers through the morning but as the day goes on, they will lose their intensity, becoming fewer and further between. We lose the cloud and rain to the south so by the afternoon, some breezy weather. Temperatures of 69 degrees. Not too bad. High pressure through the night so the risk of a starts on Tuesday. Further north, the weather fronts are dragging in, introducing a bit more cloud. Cloudy skies on Tuesday. Temperatures very similar, seven to 9 degrees. It is not until we reach Wednesday when we start to see the weather fronts moving southwards and the cold air beginning to arrive from the North. The rain to the south and east, behind that the windy conditions and frequent sleet and snow showers. The temperature is starting to fall away. The cold air becomes well-established across the whole of the UK by the end of the week. Mixed in with that we have low pressure sitting to the east of us in Scandinavia and around that low-pressure, notjust the potential for sleet and snow showers at low levels but also more significant snow. The detail of the forecast through this week is one to watch out for. We could see further snow showers developing through the day on Thursday. With the cold air and strong winds, the temperatures will feel very cold, more like minus two degrees in the major towns and cities. On Friday, a similar pattern with a cold windy day and some bright spells but the risk of snow showers. It looks like it will stay that way into the weekend. The potential for some disruption with snow in the forecast. At this stage we need to keep an eye on the detail. If you are travelling, keep ",,

The UKIP leader Nigel Farage says he wishes he’d sacked his defecting MEP Amjad Bashir sooner over a series of business and financial irregularities, despite having defended him over some of the allegations in the past. Mr Bashir says he’s done nothing wrong, and has called UKIP a vanity project for Mr Farage. Here’s our political correspondent Carole Walker.

There have been violent clashes between police and protesters in Cairo on the fourth anniversary of the Arab Spring uprising. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed. Demonstrators had gathered in the capital to mark the event, which toppled President Mubarak from power. Our Middle East correspondent Orla Guerin reports. Four years after Egypt’s revolution, peaceful protesters are still being buried. They mourn for Shaima al—Sabbagh, shot dead on Saturday going to lay a wreath in Tahrir Square. Here she was with colleagues from a leftist partyjust minutes before her death. Masked police fire at the demonstrators. And they continue shooting, even after Shaima is hit. A fellow activist tries to save her, but she’s been hit in the back. The authorities initially denied the devoted mother was gunned down by police, but this campaigner, who was present, told us there is no doubt. It was clear. No other party was there in the Square except us and them. So the police killed her? Of course. Of course. Of course. They targeted her and killed her. Not far from where Shaima was killed, we found this gathering underway today. This is about the only kind of protest that is allowed here. This demonstration is very clearly in favour of the president. These protesters aren’t being chased away by the police, there is no tear gas or bird shot here. That is reserved for those who oppose the authorities. They were in the firing line again today, as police cracked down on Islamists and liberals. Protests are virtually banned here. Many say there is more oppression now than before the revolution. Orla Guerin, BBC News. The European Union will hold an emergency meeting this week to discuss the renewed fighting in Ukraine, after rebels began an offensive on the port of Mariupol. Rocket strikes this weekend hit residential areas of the town, killing 30 people and injuring over 100. NATO has accused Russia of sending troops to the conflict, but Moscow says it’s pushing for a peaceful solution. Japan’s Prime Minister has accepted as genuine an online video claiming to show a hostage murdered by Islamic State militants. Shinzo Abe said the focus now was on securing the release of a remaining second hostage. Our correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes reports from Tokyo. Looking tired and worn from the last five days, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe went on national television to confirm what all here had feared. The grisly pictures on the Internet are of this man, Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa. We are analysing the validity of this picture, he says. Unfortunately, we believe it is highly likely it is valid. ""I have no words to express what must be an extremely painful moment ""for his family."" He had gone to Syria last year, supposedly to set up a security company. In August, he was caught by Islamic State fighters. Hiding his face from the cameras, Haruna Yukawa’s father told Japanese TV he has no words to describe his loss. But he also apologised for the trouble he said his son’s capture had caused for Japan. That apology shows just how complex feelings in Japan are about this hostage crisis. Many Japanese people appeared to believe that by going to Syria, Haruna Yukawa was responsible for dragging Japan into this mess. There is however considerably more public sympathy for the second hostage, who is believed to have gone to Syria to try to negotiate his release. Tonight, 3 small group of protesters gathered outside Prime Minister’s office, demanding he do more to get Kenji Goto out. That will not be easy. Islamic State is now demanding the release of this woman from a Jordanian jail cell, where she is awaiting execution. In 2005, Sajida Mubarak al—Rishawi took part in a suicide bomb attack on a Jordanian hotel, but her vest failed to explode. So far, there is no sign theJordanian government is willing to trade her for Mr Goto’s life. With all the sport, here’s Katherine Downes at the BBC Sport Centre...

125,BBC1 London,25-jan-2015,BBC Weekend News,22:00,20 mins,True,"I don’t think this was an accident. I think this is murder. You’re out of your mind if you think I did it. Have you decided about the newjob? I need to go. It’s such a great opportunity for me. She can’t go unless we agree to the transfer. Well? Tonight at ten, it’s an historic win for the left party Syriza in Greece. Their leader says a new era has begun, but it’s unclear whether the party has enough seats to govern alone. On the streets there is due bill should not amongst supporters who had to end your years of austerity. I’m very excited that I’ve lived to see this. They left government for the first time in Greece. It’s unbelievable and amazing. And the other main stories tonight: Downing Street is reviewing security procedures after a hoax caller managed to get through to the Prime Minister. A war of words - Nigel Farage says he should have sacked defector Amjad Bashir earlier - Mr Bashir says Ukip isjust a vanity project for the leader. And Andy Murray comes back from the brink in a thrilling win at the Australian Open. Good evening from Athens. The left wing anti-austerity party, Syriza, has won a historic victory in Greece’s general election - winning 36% of the vote according to the latest official count. The most recent count shows they are only one seat short of an overall majority here. Syriza has promised to renegotiate Greece’s international bailout and put an end to austerity. But this could put Greece on a collision course with its European partners. Our Europe editor Gavin Hewitt’s report contains flash photography. Supporters of Greece’s radical left party waited, daring to believe this was their moment. CHEERING This was history. The left had not tasted power in Greece in over 60 years. The party Syriza had won a decisive victory on a platform of opposition to austerity and budget cuts with their leader promising to end the country’s humiliation. I’m very excited that I’ve lived to see this, they left government for the first time in Greece. It’s unbelievable, it’s amazing. TRANSLATION: unbelievable, it’s amazing. TRANSLATION: Finally our dreams are coming true and we have something we can give to our children. It’s the best moment of my life. Tonight Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the radical left party Syriza went to his headquarters. Many of Europe’s leaders had warned against voting for him, fearing his promise to renegotiate Greece’s bailout agreement. TRANSLATION: With this, Greece turns the page, leaves behind the poverty of catastrophe, leaves behind the fear, leaves five years of humiliation. So, the Greek voters have sent a message, they don’t believe that austerity has worked and so they’ve backed a candidate who has promised to renegotiate the bailout deal, and from tomorrow to start ending austerity and also to try and write down the debt. They may be celebrating here tonight, but unpredictable days lie ahead for Greece. Earliertoday unpredictable days lie ahead for Greece. Earlier today Alexis Tsipras had cast his vote. He had understood that his country had grown weary of economic collapse and five years of recession. When I spoke to him he was clear this was an election about austerity. What’s your message for Europe? Austerity is over, this is the message. The vicious circle of austerity is over, was his message. His opponent was the Conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. He had the support of most of Europe’s leaders who believed he was the best guarantor of stability. But the voters had lost faith that a corner had been turned. One woman here said simply the situation had become unbearable. Syriza’s supporters celebrated unbearable. Syriza’s supporters celebrated into the evening. At renegotiating Greece’s bailout deal will not be easy and there were warnings today from a senior German official that Greece had to stick to its agreements. Gavin Hewitt, BBC News, Athens. Gavinjoins me live now. On the face of it this has seemed like a seismic election result. What impact do you think it will have? There is no doubt this will send shock waves through Europe. But the facts are that a radical left party, anti-austerity, has been swept to power. It will embolden other anti-austerity parties will swear in places like Spain who will believe they can change the prevailing narrative. -- elsewhere. Most importantly a majority of voters have neglected the core policy of dealing with the Eurozone crisis designed in Brussels and Berlin, in exchange for bailouts countries have to adopt deep budget cuts and reforms. The voters said not at any price here. Syriza says it wants to negotiate, renegotiate the bailout. How possible and feasible is that? Negotiations will take place but they will be difficult. Already a senior German official has come out and said agreements must be abided by, they must be stuck with. We had a few days ago a Eurozone Prime Minister who gave a resigned in no to the idea they could be any relief of Greek debt. Tomorrow, importantly, we will hearfrom Greek debt. Tomorrow, importantly, we will hear from Angela Merkel. The fact is that Alexis Tsipras here has a democratic mandate now. There will have to be negotiations. The difficulty will come if they stall. If there is a deadlock then some will believe that Greece could be heading towards bankruptcy. And of course, if that happens, it will unsettle the Eurozone once again. Gavin Hewitt, Europe editor, many thanks. One Syriza activist I spoke to in the last hour, said he believes other anti austerity parties across the EU will be galvanised by the result here. Maybe, maybe not but there’s little doubt while the Syriza victory was predicted, it is still a big shock to the Euro Zone as a whole. For the moment it’s back to you Reeta in London. Thanks very much, Clive. Downing Street says security procedures are being reviewed at all government departments - after a hoax caller got through to both David Cameron, and to the intelligence agency GCHO. Let’s go now to Westminster and to our correspondent Christian Fraser- how did this happen? Yes, they are investigating two hoax calls. In the first instance on was made to GCHQ, the government’s glistening headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire resulting in the disclosure of a mobile phone number used by the director Robert Hannigan. We understand that that mobile phone is an unclassified mobile phone so not one that is used to exchange secure information. In the second instance a hoax caller claiming to be Robert Hannigan managed to get, we presume, past the Downing Street switchboard to a mobile phone that the Prime Minister was using, unofficial mobile phone. He answered it. There was a brief conversation until he realised it was a hoax call and then he hung up. Again, no sensitive information disclosed. Obviously this is something GCHQ and Downing Street will take very seriously, particularly the issue of mobile phones because they can be located and traced. There is a review of security on going tonight, and as you say all government departments are being told to be on the lookout for this kind of hoax call. Christian Fraser, many thanks. The Ukip leader Nigel Farage says he wishes he’d sacked his defecting MEP Amjad Bashir sooner over a series of business and financial irregularities - despite having defended him over some of the allegations in the past. Mr Bashir says he’s done nothing wrong- and has called Ukip a vanity project for Mr Farage. Here’s our political correspondent Carole Walker. Nigel Farage was all too keen to pose with Amjad Bashir when he became Ukip’s only Asian MEP, an important symbol for a party keen to dispel a predominantly white image. But now that Mr Bashir has turned his back on Ukip, the party’s leader says he’s glad to be rid of him. We’ve been increasingly alarmed by Mr Bashir’s behaviour over the last few months. He didn’t tell us the truth about the employment of illegal immigrants in his business. He denies all of this, we have to say, quite strongly. I’m afraid to say there is some quite strong documentary evidence. We’ve been investigating this. There are some big open questions in Brussels about money. A Conservative spokesman said this Manchester restaurant run by Mr Bashir’s sons did receive a fine for immigration offences, but Amjad Bashir was not a director at the time. Today, Mr Bashir denied all Ukip’s allegations, which he described as baseless. He said his former party had defended him on the issue and only changed its tune after he had met David Cameron and decided to join the Conservatives. Ukip got wind of it and tried to muddy the waters and accused me of things which are totally wrong. They don’t want my defection to be seen as a major event. That’s why they’ve done this, brought these allegations. If you want change, vote Ukip. After two former Conservative MPs defected to Ukip the Tories are delighted to have a new recruit of their own and have dismissed the allegations against him as desperate stuff. We are absolutely satisfied that somebody who wants to see a referendum on Europe, who wants to see control over immigration, has found the right place to get that, and that’s in the Conservative Party because we are the only party that can deliver those things. Ukip wanted to focus on the NHS today. The party says it will spend an extra £3 billion a year on the health service, with money it would save by leaving the EU and ending its contributions. Ukip says it’s committed to an NHS free at the point of use provided you’re a British national. It has debated and rejected the idea of an insurance-based system but it does still need to reassure voters on what will be a key election issue. It’s been tough going for Amjad Bashir since he decided to switch parties, but this skirmish is just a foretaste of what’s to come with just over 100 days to the general election. Carole Walker, BBC News. There have been violent clashes between police and protesters in Egypt on the fourth anniversary of the country’s revolution, which swept President Mubarak from power. Around a dozen protestors and three police have been killed in the violence - mostly in Cairo. Demonstrators had gathered in the capital to mark the event, from where Orla Guerin now reports. On the anniversary of the Revolution another round of bloodshed. Protests are virtually banned here, but there were scattered demonstrations by Islamist sand liberals. Many say there is more repression now than before the uprising. She was on the front lines in 2011. Yesterday she went to lay a wreath in Terry Square. She never made it. -- terrier Square. Here she was with colleagues from a leftist party in her final moments. Masked police shoot at the peaceful demonstrators. They continue firing, even after she is wounded. A fellow activist tries to save her but she’s been hit in the back with shotgun pellets. The authorities initially denied the devoted mother was banned down by police, but this campaign who was there says they killed her in cold blood. It was clear, no other party was there in the square except for us and them. So the police killed her? Of course, of course. Of course, they targeted her and killed her. Not far from where Shaimaa El-Sabagh was killed we found this gathering. This was the only kind of protest that is allowed here. This demonstration is clearly in favour of the President. These protesters are not being chased away by the police. There is no tear gas or buckshot here. That’s reserved for those who oppose the authorities. Daring to do that cost Shaimaa El-Sabagh her life. She was buried today on the anniversary of the uprising. Foryears today on the anniversary of the uprising. For years on many activists say the hope it brought is fading into memory. All are gearing, BBC News, Cairo. The European Union will hold an emergency meeting this week to discuss the renewed fighting in Ukraine, after rebels began an offensive on the port of Mariupol. Rocket strikes this weekend hit residential areas of the town, killing 30 people and injuring over100. Nato has accused Russia of sending troops to the conflict - but Moscow says it’s pushing for a peaceful solution. japan’s Prime Minister has accepted as genuine an online video claiming to show a hostage murdered by Islamic State militants. Shinzo Abe said the focus now was on securing the release of a remaining second hostage. On Tuesday, rebels said they’d kill the two men unless the country paid $200 million. The mother of a teenage girl who was held in a police cell for A8 hours because there was no hospital bed available has called for more to be done to help young people with mental health problems. The woman, who’s from Devon, told BBC News that her daughter is now being treated in a specialist psychiatric unit - but that it’s hundreds of miles from their home. jon Kay reports. It was here, at Torquay Police Station, that a vulnerable teenage girl was held in a custody suite like this for two nights because there was no mental health bed available. When I walked in and saw her lying there on the floor, heartbreaking. This is the first time her mother has spoken since the incident last November. She does not want to be identified but she told the BBC it is a scandal that a child with complex mental health needs could be detained in a cell for A8 hours. I finally decided on the Saturday morning that I’d had enough. I packed her bags and went and sat at the police station. She was still wearing the clothes that I left her in on the Thursday night. An absolute mess, she was. The teenager’s plight was highlighted on Twitter by the Assistant Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police. He said it was unacceptable for there to be no mental health care available. Following that intervention the teenager was released from the police station here and was found a bed on a psychiatric ward. But, the specialist unit where she is now being treated is more than 300 miles from her family here in Devon. It’s going to be about once every three or four weeks that I get to see my child. My daughter needs her family. In the light of this case the Government has announced that mentally ill teenagers will no longer be held in police cells. Ministers say they are also investing millions of pounds in extra beds and better treatment. The idea, if you have a physical health crisis, that you get treated in that way, either put in a police cell or sent hundreds of miles away from home, it would never happen so why does it happen in mental health? That’s what has to end. But, mental health charities and campaign groups say what happened to one teenager here in Torquay has drawn attention to a much wider issue, which needs urgent attention. jon Kay, BBC News, Devon. Viewers in south-west England can see more on that story on Inside Out at 7:30pm tomorrow night. Andy Murray is through to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open after beating Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in four sets. It was Murray’s biggest test of the tournament so far. He dropped the second set and was a break down in the fourth - but battled back to win. Katie Gornall watched the action. just a bad day at the office - was how Andy Murray described his straight-sets loss to Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon last year. Having already avenged that defeat at the Paris Masters in October, Murray was keen to reassert his authority here in Melbourne. 3-0 down after a poor start, the British number one soon found his range and took the first set 6-li. This set the pattern for a contest where the momentum seemed to shift with every shot. The second set belonged to Dimitrov as he underlined why he is considered the rising star of the men’s game. It was the first set that Murray has dropped in this tournament but his mood would improve when he took the third 6-3. Again Dimitrov refused to throw in the towel and a fifth set seemed to beckon as the Bulgarian moved 5-2 up in the fourth. But there was no stopping the march of Murray and he responded brilliantly, this time Dimitrov had no answer as Murray won the next five games sealing victory with a forehand and a slice of luck. He’ll now face Australian Nick Kyrgios in the last eight. Katie Gornall, BBC News. Football now, and Match of the Day - with Sportscene in Scotland - follows the news - so if you don’t want to know what happened in today’s three FA Cup lith round games - you know what to do. After yesterday’s day of shocks - all three Premier League teams in action today have made it through to the fifth round. Aston Villa beat Championship leaders Bournemouth 2-1; West Ham beat League One Bristol City 1-0. And defending champions Arsenal were forced to hang on for victory against Championship side Brighton. They were 2-0 up and survived a spirited comeback by Brighton to win the game three-two. Back to our main story, the Greek collections and Clive Myrie is in Athens. Clive. A nation is now digestive and the dramatic result of the election here and so to are officials at the IMF in Brussels and in capitals across the Eurozone, most notably perhaps the largest creditor nation linked to Greece, Germany. This evening I’ve been chatting about the day’s events with two local people who didn’t see to eye about the election. In an alley behind the gates in a cafe in Athens I came across opposing views of Syriza’s victory. He voted for them but he did not. So what did he make of Syriza’s message throughout the campaign that a vote for them is a vote for hope? Hope doesn’t feed my kids, I need a plan. I need to know how this economy will turn around. I need to know how customers that I have will have liveable salaries so there can be an economy. So you have hope for tomorrow? Yes because we don’t have anything. I can’t have hope with the same people getting elected year in and year out since the day I was born. Syriza up has promised much and after years of austerity they are a breath of fresh air. Even if Syriza doesn’t managed to do 100% of what he said before the elections even this 10% is very important. But that’s not enough for Stavros. I see people voting, blinded by anger without even listening or considering what a plan might look like. What they do agree on is that this is a leaping to the unknown, that there is no certainty what tomorrow will bring because ultimately this country’s fate may not be decided here but in Berlin. Angela Merkel once described the leader of Syriza as an unhelpful troublemaker. His victory tonight has given officials in Brussels and those in Germany pause for thought, perhaps about the role of undiluted austerity measures in dealing with the Eurozone crisis. A policy officials have pursued with zeal. Tonight, the hard left in this country, are celebrating, believing they can temper that zeal. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from me in Athens. Stay with us on BBC One, it’s time for the where you are.

And, Camden gives the green light to the multi-million pound transformation of Tottenham Court Road. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The new ruler of Saudi Arabia has said there will be no change of direction for the country, following the death of King Abdullah. He was 90 and had been suffering from pneumonia. King Salman, who is 79 and the late monarch’s half-brother, spoke publicly within hours of his accession, to say he will continue his predecessor’s policies. Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil producer in the world, and under King Abdullah has been a key ally of Washington. Frank Gardner reports. Passed away at 90 King Abdullah died of pneumonia earlier today. He has managed to world’s biggest oil producing and exporting country. Home to the two holiest sites in Islam. In this deeply conservative and traditional kingdom he wove a care. Path between modernising the country and not upsetting the powerful religious clergy. He gave women more political and economic opportunities. He twrieed to curb -- tried to curb corruption and waste. Saudi Arabia remains out of step with most of the rest of the world, forbidding women from driving and applying draconian punishment. It has used antiterrorism laws to lock UP has used antiterrorism laws to lock up its critics. Some question why Britain and the West have a close relationship with such a country. Saudi Arabia is a family-run country. The only one in the world named after the ruling family. The late King’s half brother has become the new King. His son is the new Defence Minister. Fellow rulers have begun arriving today to pay their respects. No-one expects dramatic changes from the new King, who is 79 and very much part of the old establishment. His immediate priority will be to ensure stability and avoid any family squabbles spilling into the public glare. It is a family business. One will not see enormous changes. These sons themselves are in their 50s and 60s and working as senior ministers. I don’t think we will expect revolutionary change. That is never the Saudi way. There are numerous challenges facing Saudi Arabia. It has declared war on the jihadists of Islamic State. The warplanes have joined the US-coalition in bombing IS positions. This is deeply unpopular with some Saudis who think their Government is taking the wrong side. Ten years ago the country faced a murderous insurgency by Al-Qaeda. King Abdullah labelled them defents. With violentjihadism on them defents. With violent jihadism on the rise across the region, there are fears it could see a repeat of terrorist cells plotting multiple attacks against both policemen and western ex-pattryiates. There was a 1,000 lash sentence handed to a critic calling for peaceful reform. For human rights reformers the old King’s reforms did not go far enough. The legacy is hardly a glowing one when we talk about human rights. The situation is of endemic torture in police cells and in prisons. Women of course are not allowed to drive a car without fear of arrest. We have the case of a blogger and free-speech activist who is in jail, blogger and free-speech activist who is injail, facing a ten-year sentence and 1,000 lashes in a public square. So, a very, very poor human rights record indeed. In accordance with custom King Abdullah is being buried today. Believes a rich country being pulled in two directs, towards the past traditions and the modern world. The new King will have to tread carefully to find the right path between the two. And Frank is with me. Let’s talk more about those challenges. You have touched on some of it, but where the new King will have to take Saudi Arabia. . The mediate challenge is to make sure -- Saudi Arabia. . The mediate challenge is to make sure -- the immediate challenge is to make sure the accession goes ahead smoothly. He has appointed his own son, who is only 35, as the new Defence Minister and head of the royal court. That will raise a few eyebrows. He has promoted the interior minister to be second in line to the throne. He’s only in his 50s. It is likely he’ll be King before too long. So, there’s the succession, there is Islamic insurgency. The fact I mentioned there that Saudi Arabia is fighting on the side of the Americans - there that Saudi Arabia is fighting on the side of the Americans - the US-led coalition, in bombing Islamic State targets. That is very unpopular with some Saudis because they are saying, these are our fellow Sunnis. Why are we bombing them when we should be bombing the Iranians, the Shias. This is what people say. Of course, the fact we’ve seen they cannot tolerate dissent, even even when online. There is a growing problem with the population and underemployment. The Government tries to force companies to employ certain quotas of Saudi people, trying to get rid of workers from Asia and Africa, who do the jobs Saudis don’t want to do. As the population grows, they’ll have more and more pressure. There are not enough meaningfuljobs to go around. Thank you. There’s been an improvement in the performance of Accident and Emergency units in England. The target is for 95% of patients to be seen and treated within four hours. Last week the figure stood at 92.4%, which though below that target, is the best figure since November. Here’s our health correspondent, Dominic Hughes. At the james cook hospital in Middlesbrougher it has been a tough week A&E. Staff have been busy treating patients like Rose, who suffered a fall at home. I was frozen stiff in the two minutes between getting out of the ambulance and getting into the hospital. Apart from that, no, everything went: I have not had any delays at all. The latest figures from NHS England show an improismt in how A&E departments are coping winter. Patients faced shorter waiting times, just over 92% were treated within four hours. This still misses the Government’s target of 95%. Faster treatment times could be explained in a number of drops of patients, from 377,000 a reduction of 12,000. There were problems discharging patients from hospital. Delayed transfers of care were at their highest point for this winter. At james Cook they are trying to address that problem - At james Cook they are trying to address that problem - opening more beds and ensuring patients are discharged home when they are ready. We have opened 16 beds here on the Winter Ward. That is easing pressures in A&E. We are activity getting patients discharged to home or to the right place of care for them. With the weather having recently turned colder, staff are far from convinced the worst of the winter pressures are over. It is difficult to know whether this is a sustained improvement. From my experience, you get weeks that are quiet. This week, we have seen a difference in the number of patients attending. I don’t really know why that is. We’ll have to see over the next couple of weeks whether this is a sustained improvement. NHS England says the health service continues to face huge pressures on front-line services, particularly A&E, NHS 111 and ambulance crews. It is a similar picture across the UK. The latest available figures for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland show the NHS is under strain wherever you live. The first batch of a trial vaccine against the Ebola virus is being flown to West Africa today. The British firm, GlaxoSmith Kline, is one of the companies that’s developed the drug. It’s due to be given to people in the worst affected countries, where more than 8,500 people have died. Here’s our health correspondent, Bra nwen jeffreys. In West Africa, they are still digging graves. Each small white cross, another life claimed by Ebola. There are signs the pace of the outbreak is slowing. And now, from high-tech laboratories in the UK, dozes of a vaccine beginning theirjourney to Liberia. Within weeks, these will be used on volunteers. The challenge is to test whether it works and is safe quickly. As the number of cases falls, that becomes harder. The duration of the trial depends on how many cases there are. So, the more active the diseases, the quicker the trial will go. The less active the disease, the slower. So, over the next few months you would expect to learn more about the vk seen. That will confirm what the -- learn more about the vk seen. That will confirm what the -- the vaccine. That will confirm what the safety and effect is. Of the volume tears involved in this -- safety and effect is. Of the volume tears involved in this -- volunteers involved in this international trial, 10,000 will be given the vaccine from the UK. 10,000 a placebo and 10,000 an experimental vaccine. It is a few months since volunteers began to help researcher, developing a test vaccine this quickly is unprecedented. It took an Ebola outbreak, on a huge scale, to galvanise the effort. Scientists say there are still challenges ahead I will not be easy to gather reliable information. This part of West Africa has been devastated by war, then Ebola. These are challenging conditions in which to carry out trials, because you need to be able to collect the data you need to monitor the individuals who receive the vaccines. All that is reasonably difficult. Nurses and doctors will be among those getting the test vaccines. But until one is proven, no risks will be taken with this deadly virus. The mother of one of two japanese citizens held by Islamic State militants has appealed for her son to be released. The plea came just hours before a deadline, set by the militants, for the payment of a $200 million ransom for the hostages. That deadline has now passed. The Democratic Unionist Party and Respect’s George Galloway have become the latest parties to say they should be included in any televised debate between the political leaders before the General Election. Let’s speak to our political correspondent, Iain Watson. What chances do you think these will happen in the end? I think, on balance, probably more likely than unlikely. It is very much in the balance. We are getting positive noises from the Conservatives. David Cameron said he would not take part without the Greens - Cameron said he would not take part without the Greens - they have an MP. So the broadcasters have been doing their best to make sure there was not an empty podium where the Prime Minister should be. They have included the Greens, the SNP and the Welsh Nationalists. If that is a potential problem to one problem, to getting David Cameron to take part, it is, as you suggested, creating problems elsewhere. So, the DUP in Northern Ireland are saying they have got more MPs than the SNP and the Welsh Nationalists so why are they not included. Then George Galloway, Respect MP, in the past hour has said that he might take legal action if his party is not included in a debate as well. Now, I think if under all this pressure and all this confusion, if the debates end up collapsing, I don’t think David Cameron would be too disappointed. His advisers believe he’s got the most to lose from taking part in these debates. He felt that weekly debates during the last election campaign sucked the life out of a lot of his campaigning work. If it did go ahead with seven parties involved, he might be able to portray himself as Prime Ministerial, while his opponents are given the same status as minor parties. Labour have discussed this with the broadcasters. Their key point is to keep the pressure up on the Prime Minister to take part in a debate, no matter how many others are on the stage as well. Thank you. The energy supplier Npower is to cut standard tariff gas prices by an average of 5.1% from February 16th. The company is the fourth of the so-called Big Six energy suppliers to reduce its prices in the wake of falling wholesale costs. It comes after the Government warned that suppliers which failed to pass savings on to customers could face action. The richest and the poorest households in Britain have been hardest hit by the tax and benefit changes brought in by the coalition Government. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says lower income families have been hit hardest, as a percentage of their income - while the wealthiest have lost most in cash terms. The IFS says middle-income families have been ""remarkably unscathed"". Our personal finance correspondent, Simon Gompertz, is here with more details. We all know that benefits have been squeezed. Taxes have been squeezed, which is very poor for those at the very top. Those know who they are. But the average is a loss of ÂlI89 per year household. But then let’s split it up. The top 10% of income earners, and with children, they have lost £5,350 on average. And incomes of £70,000 or more. And then at the bottom end, the bottom 10%, with children, they have lost over £1200 a year each. That is incomes of £20,000 and less, roughly. The proportion of the percentage hit is biggerfor them. Yes. proportion of the percentage hit is biggerforthem. Yes. Forthose proportion of the percentage hit is biggerfor them. Yes. For those who have lost out, explain more about the key things that have driven that? We are all affected by for instance the rise in VAT that we saw soon after the government came in. But for people at the lower end, benefits are being operated by a smaller amount than they would have expected. -- smaller amount than they would have expected. -- up rated. Council tax benefit has been less for many people. Child benefit has been frozen. At the top end, there’s been a restriction on pension, tax breaks, higher national insurance, and more people in the 1+0% tax bracket. That is why they have come out on top. In the middle, some people have done better, particularly families without children. The time now is 1:17pm. Our top story this lunch time... The funeral has been taking place of the late King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. His successor has called for unity and solidarity among Muslim countries. Still to come, you are never too old to learn. We meet the world ‘s oldest student, starting school and a sprightly 90 years young. Later, Alexander McOueen’s inspiration came from the capital. Now they V&A celebrate his work. And can Tottenham and all the pressure of four competitions, as they look ahead to the FA Cup? These may look like just black-and-white photographs of rocks but actually they are pictures of a landscape that no human eye has ever seen. They were taken in November, as the Rosetta spacecraft prepared to land on a comet at the end of a ten year voyage into deep space. It is hoped they will help scientists understand how the Earth was formed. So alien and yet somehow strangely familiar. These look like weathered cliffs overlooking a perfectly still ocean of rock. New pictures from the Rosetta spacecraft show features on a comet that have never been seen before. Like this hole, the size of a football pitch. Next to it is this slab of material that once fitted on top, like a lid. Blown out by a mighty explosion. And most surprising of all, these bumps look like sand dunes, blown in the wind. But as we know, there is no wind in space. Sojust what has caused these incredible features? Scientists believe that ice just under the surface is slowly melting am creating a breeze. This blows over the rock to form structures that look like sand junes. Deeper the rock to form structures that look like sandjunes. Deeper under look like sand junes. Deeper under the look like sandjunes. Deeper under the surface are more pockets of ice, which melt as it gets close to the sun. That produces the cracks and holes that we see all over the comet. There is an even more remarkable discovery, a clue as to how these mysterious objects formed at the very beginning of the solar system. Look closely inside this hole and you can see bumps. Scientists call them goose bumps. They are all the same shape and size, and they could be the building blocks from which comets were formed. The goose bumps came together to build originally small bodies and then body the size of a comet, and then eventually by combining these together you can get UP combining these together you can get up to things like planet size. This is giving us a real clue on how planets like the Earth get formed. The latest pictures from the Rosetta spacecraft suggest that comets and possibly our own Earth may well have been built piece by piece like a Lego model millions of years ago -- billions of years ago. The people of Greece go to the polls on Sunday in one of the most crucial general elections in the country’s history. The choice before voters is to keep a government pledged to economic reform and budget cuts or to vote for an anti-austerity party, Syriza, which is promising to end what it calls Greece’s "" national humiliation"". In Drama, they know all about the crisis. Five years of punishing austerity. Ilias is a stonemason but the work has dried up. He now spends his days making toys for his kids. He is hardly poor, but a family that has been involved in centre-right politics for generations is voting for Syriza this time around. TRANSLATION: We’ve seen nothing like this in Greece since the end of the Second World War. They have humiliated us, stripped us of our dignity and destroy democracy. We’ve been betrayed by the whole political system. At the local hospital, everyone knows the Greek health service has been hit really hard by austerity cuts. Grim times for many. Undaunted, a government MP running for re-election is paying a visit. Make sure you’re out by Sunday, he jokes, so you can vote. The government argues that the economy is turning a corner, and Syriza is making promises it can’t keep. But how much more pain can people take? TRANSLATION: Syriza say they will spend more money, but they don’t tell us where they will find it. It all sounds good. We’d like to spend more too. But we have to live within our means, not with borrowed money. But the crisis has taken its toll. Unemployment in Drama is high and incomes have fallen rapidly. It is the same story across the country. So in this election season, it is hardly surprising that more and more Greeks are prepared to take a punt on an alternative political vision. A few will vote for the extreme right. A lot more for the radical left. The old order, they feel, has let them down. The Syriza slogan here, ""Hope is on the way."" There is a long road ahead. And the votes have yet to be counted. But it feels like the stage is set for change. The criminaljustice system in England and Wales is inefficient, time-consuming and too expensive, according to one of our most seniorjudges. Lord Leveson says changes need to be made. This is criminaljustice, 21st-century style. Police officers wearing cameras to record evidence digitally. It isjust one of the technological innovations that could improve things in a criminaljustice system that is beset by inefficiency and delays. Lord justice Levenson is the man tasked with laying down the blueprint for the future of criminal justice. Our conduct of criminal trials was designed in the 19th century with many changes and reforms bolted on. The result is thatit reforms bolted on. The result is that it has become inefficient, time-consuming and, as a consequence, very expensive. His report, published today, recommends greater use of video and other conferencing technology across the system, with more hearings taking place remotely. A streamlined approach to evidence which has been captured electronically, such as interviews with child witnesses. Tighter case management byjudges Tighter case management by judges including Tighter case management byjudges including timetables for evidence, and lawyers and speeches. And contracts with providers tightened so that prisoners appear on time. It is a well thought out, detailed and comrades of report. But there is one thing that is vital, the next government has defined it properly, to bring in the computers, screens and links that will be needed to make it work. The recommendations are largely about technology and procedures, but it also raises some radical potential changes. Why should the defendant choose the right -- should the defendant choose the right-- retain should the defendant choose the right -- retain the right to choose the longer and more expensive jury trial for offences like that of a sandwich. Or whether that should be exercised by the court. More pressing are today’s recommendations in times of austerity. The government says it is looking forward to working with the judges to create improvements. Tennis, and Roger Federer is out of the Australian Open. The second seed and four time champion was beaten by the Italian, Andreas Seppi. But Andy Murray is through to the fourth round. Packing his bags and heading for the exit. Not for 11+ years has Roger Federer waved goodbye to Melbourne this early, but against Andreas Seppi his usual precision seemed to desert him. Catching for the crowd, but there was no catching his opponent. Seppi supreme in a blaze of winners, he was two sets up. But Federer had won all ten of his previous meetings, and after taking the third set, the old magic seemed to be back. But instead it was Seppi that soared to new heights, sealing the win of his career with the shot of his life. He’s done it! And he is through! The world above 1+6 had beaten perhaps the greatest ever. Federer later said it was just a bad day. It was another good day, though, for Andy Murray. After last year’s frustrations, he has been in imperious form so far in Melbourne, as Portugal’sjoao Sousa became the latest to discover. Murray is yet to drop a set, and you can see why. His fans know that tougher tests await, but in this sort of form, Murray could really make his mark. They say it’s never too late to fulfill your dreams, and Pricilla Sitineye is living proof. It’s thought she is the world’s oldest school pupil, after starting primary school at the age of 90. Our correspondent Ed Thomas has been to meet her. Write that word, ""correction"", everybody. Welcome to DeLaet Primary, where class four is hard at work. Much like any other school, except for the students they call Gogo, or grandmother. Meet Priscilla Sitineye. Here they say she is the oldest primary school pupil in the world. Hello Gogo. Hello, how are you? I’m very well, thank you. How are you? How old are you? 90. 90 years of age. TRANSLATION: I see children who are living hopelessly, children who are lost. I want them to see me in school. I want to inspire them. Rain, rain, come. And whatever her classmates can do, so can Gogo. Here she is making up for lost time. She has been a motivator to all the pupils around here. And I think I’m very proud of her and what she is doing. And it is notjust the teachers who are proud. Seven classmates here are Gogo’s great-grandchildren. I love Gogo because when we make noise, she tells us to be quiet! Are you her best friends? Yes. Why? Because she tells stories. Gogo is class prefect, and with it her knowledge and tribal traditions are passed on to future generations. she also represents a wider belief here that education is notjust for the few, it is for everyone, no matter how old you are always from. -- how old you are, or where you are from. I want to say to the children of the world, especially girls, education can be your wealth. Don’t look back. And with that, Gogo has her own lesson to teach. But it is never too late. Let’s take a look at the weather prospects. We’ve just had the coldest night of the Windsor, across England. -9 last night in parts of Buckinghamshire and Berkshire as well. It wasn’t as cold further north because we have more clout. Unfortunately with it, its attendant weather fronts are giving us some rain and hill snow as well. Behind that weather front, back, the wintry showers, two fairly low levels, so concern for this evening’s rush hour with icy patches. It could even be a bit sleety across parts of Humberside and Yorkshire as well. Despite the fact that temperatures are higher than we’ve seen for a while, we will at least keep some sunshine with that bracing wind and rain. Most of us will have a splash of rain as that weather front moves through tonight. Hale and thunder and possible snow at lower levels. Temperature is not as low tonight but low enough on the roads for a risk, but certainly so in the north because you have got showers coming in and potentially washing off some of the salt as well. On Saturday we start quite cold. That icy start is certainly regulated by the sunshine. On Sunday we flipped the coin and bring in more mild winds but also cloud and the risk of snowfall. On Saturday a lot of eastern Scotland and later Northern Ireland and much of England and Wales, very few showers, but there is that cold wind blowing, but I’m sure the sunshine will compensate. A different day as we head into Sunday, we start to pull in that milder Atlantic air again. We continue this seesaw, this oscillation, because behind that we have got the cold weather waiting in the wind as well. A lot of usable weather for England and Wales and eastern Scotland, strengthening winds eastern Scotland, strengthening winds bringing more clout and patchy rain into western areas. Temperatures higher than they have been but still quite chilly, although bright in the south and the East. So not looking too bad. That is all from us for this lunch time. Now it is time for the news wherever you are. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Victoria Hollins. A former hedge fund manager has been jailed for 13 years for conning investors out of more than £350 million. Magnus Peterson, who ran a company in Mayfair that collapsed in 2009, had already been convicted of eight counts of fraud, forgery, false accounting and fraudulent trading following a three-month trial at Southwark Crown Court. Rebecca Williams has been in court. ~ .As . As the sentence was read out today, Peterson closed his eyes and bowed his head. There was a scheme with bonus swap contracts. His actions affected a number of people - people with pension schemes, charities and individuals with businesses, many of which collapsed due to his actions. The judge today said he didn’t know whether it was Peterson’s arrogance or greed that led to his dishonesty. We heard he had four children, the youngest six and the oldest 17. The investigation has been going on for several years. The judge criticised the Serious Fraud Office, because in 2011 they told Peterson that the criminal investigation against him would be dropped. That didn’t happen. Today, he’s been sentenced to a total of 13 years. It is believed this is the largest fraud of its nature in ",,

Tonight on BBC London: A pub manager and chef are jailed after a customer dies from food poisoning following a Christmas Day dinner. And the terrifying moment a smash and grab robber pulls a machete on a have a go hero. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Broadcasters have published new plans for televised leader debates before the general election - and say they will go ahead even if one or more of the political parties decline the invitation. Three debates are planned. Two of them would be between seven parties. It comes after broadcasters failed to reach agreement with the political parties over the original proposals, which only included the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems and UKIP. Here’s our political correspondent, Ian Watson. These debates dominated the last election campaign. The political leaders may have disagreed on screen but at least they all agreed to take part. This time, the broadcasters have had to come up with an ultimatum. Participate on our terms, or we go ahead anyway. There is a carrot as well as a stick. David Cameron said he would not take part without the Green party and they are now on the guest list. I think it’s very clear the future of politics does not look like the past. We are in a multiparty age which is really good because we are getting a much broader range of political views being presented to voters, who then have a broader choice. So what are the new proposals? Tee debates by the BBC and ITV would feature the leaders of the Conservatives, labour, the Lib Dems, Ukip, the Scottish National party, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. The third debate would have David Cameron and Ed Miliband going head-to-head on Channel A and sky. The proposed dates are April two, 16 and 30, the last asked a week before polling day. The ball is in the Prime Minister’s court and I’m waiting to hear the next excuse, like he’s washing his hair that night. Nigel Farage is keen to debate with David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and whoever else the broadcasters put in the studio. So have the broadcasters make too many compromises? This fictional debate on the continent had seven participants and was a lot less pacey than a battle between a smaller number of opponents. But even with an expanded line-up of political leaders, some smaller parties are unhappy to be left out. I think the party leaders’ parties are unhappy to be left out. I think the party leaders’ debates are now descending into farce. just in case the BBC and ITV are not aware, Northern Ireland is an integral part of the UK. We represent a lot of people and we have exactly the same number of MPs as the Green party. After months of discussion, the broadcasters actually did something pretty bold today, saying the man behind that door, the Prime Minister or any other political leader would not have a veto on the debates. Lots of detailed discussions lie ahead, but pressure is mounting on David Cameron tonight to say that he is happy to take part, at least invincible. It took five days to form a Coalition Government that lasted five years. Negotiations on this year’s debates have already taken three months, which demonstratesjust how tightly taken three months, which demonstrates just how tightly fought the next election will be. Let’s speak to our deputy political editorjames Landale, who’s at Westminter for us. who’s at Westminster for us. So will be debates definitely go ahead now? We can’t say that at all but we have moved a step closer towards them taking place. Simply because the broadcasters have made a firm commitment they will press ahead with the debates regardless of who turns up. But no guarantees and lots of obstacles to overcome. The Conservatives don’t want to ground the debates into the last month of the campaign. The Lib Dems still don’t want Nick Clegg excluded from one of the debates where he cannot defend his record in government. Ukip are not thrilled at the fact Nigel Farage has been relegated to a seven man, sorry, seven person debate, when before he was up against Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband. Although Labour are publicly saying they will accept whatever the broadcasters offer them, I’m told they still have some concerns about the SNP being given some kind of national status in the UK election. There are still substantial obstacles to overcome su bsta ntial obstacles to overcome before substantial obstacles to overcome before we reach a definitive statement that the debates will take place. Between now and then, there is still an awful lot of political manoeuvring going on. If they go belly up, everybody wants to make sure someone else gets the blame. Thank you forjoining us. Hospital waiting times in England’s Accident and Emergency departments have improved for the second week in a row. New figures show that 92.4% of patients were seen within four hours last week - the best figure since November, but still short of the 95% target. Here’s our health editor, Hugh Pym. The latest from the front line of accident and emergency. The pressure has reduced. Rose, who had a full term, is Clichy got to see a doctor fairly quickly at this hospital in Middlesbrough. I was frozen stiff in two minutes, between getting out of the ambulance and getting into hospital. Apart from that, everything went well and I have not had any delays. The weekly figures from England show that A&E attendance fell from just under 390,000, to 377,000 last week. The percentage seen within four hours also improved, up from under 90%, to 92.4%. But delayed discharge from hospital rose from 4000 patients, to 4200. The flow of patients into hospitals through accident and emergency unit has eased, although it is only one week’s figures. The question is why that might have happened? After all the pressure earlier in the month. There was a fall in the number of calls to the NHS 111 helpline. Critics say this winter it has been referring to many patients to A&E. NHS England argues it has resulted in people being given other options. Perhaps people were put off going to emergency macro because of headlines about long waits -- macro because of headlines about long waits -- A&E. There does not seem to be a simple explanation. It is difficult to know if this is a sustained improvement. From experience, sustained improvement. From experience, you get quieter weeks. This week, we have definitely seen a difference in the number of patients attending and I don’t know why that is. We will have to see if it is a sustained improvement in the next couple of weeks. When it comes to moving people out of hospital, particularly the elderly back into the community, there are still major problems which means beds occupied for longer, making it hard to find space for new patients. We don’t have enough social care. More older people have been pushed out of the system over the last few years. So when it is time to go home, they don’t have the resources to support them to get back up on their feet, sometimes literally, to be independent again. Back in A&E, the four our waiting figures for England may have improved but they are still below the official 95% standard. Data for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are published at different times. The new ruler of Saudi Arabia has said there will be no change of direction for the country, following the death of King Abdullah. The king was buried today in the capital, Riyadh. His successor and half-brother King Salman, who is 79, spoke publicly within hours of his accession to say he will continue his predecessor’s policies. Frank Gardner reports. This report contains flash photography. Wrapped in a plain white shroud, the body of King Abdullah was laid to rest today. At 90 when he died of pneumonia, the world’s oldest monarch was buried in an unmarked grave. He is succeeded by his half brother, King Salman, a staunch conservative. World leaders have been paying their respects to the late king who, in Saudi terms, was a modest reformer. There are lots of practices in Saudi Arabia which don’t sit well and comfortable it with practices in Britain. On the other hand, one of the things King Abdullah did was moved the country and modernised it substantially. Today, there are more women in higher education than men in Saudi Arabia. This would have been unthinkable a few years ago. But Saudi women are still not allowed to drive and have to get a male relative’s position to travel -- permission to travel, Mariel start a business. King Abdullah was reluctant to antagonise the religious curl-- religious clergy by moving too quickly on women’s writes. You can be a millionaire and a fantastic, success or businesswoman but you still need a man to manage your daily business with a ministry, orsign man to manage your daily business with a ministry, or sign you out to leave the country. You still need a man to drive you around. King Abdullah has left more than a physical mark on this conservative desert kingdom. He was certainly no Democrat and yet many Saudis feel a deep affection for him. TRANSLATION: I can’t describe my feelings. From early-morning, everyone was very upset when we heard the news. He was more than a father. He meant a lot to us. The Saudi government has opened books of condolence at its embassies around the world like this one. King Abdullah is being genuinely mourned by large parts of his population. But his critics say that his reforms did not go nearly far enough, that human rights abuses are rife, and that the Saudi authorities must learn how to tolerate peaceful dissent without locking people up on charges of terrorism. Given these concerns, there is consternation in some quarters, including MPs that today, flags are flying at half- mast quarters, including MPs that today, flags are flying at half-mast in London. But the government says that is normal protocol when Monica dies. Tonight, the new King Salman is receiving oaths of allegiance from his countrymen. Tomorrow, he will receive world leaders like David Cameron, keen to continue their links with the world’s largest oil producer and exporter. The energy supplier Npower is to cut standard tariff gas prices by an average ofjust over 5% from February 16.

The number of people arrested in the UK for suspected terrorist offences linked to Syria has risen significantly.

The first batch of an experimental vaccine against Ebola is on its way to Liberia. Scientists aim to test the vaccine on 30,000 volunteers, including frontline health workers. Britain’s mobile phone market is about to undergo a big shake up. O2 is set to be bought by its rival, Three, in a deal worth more than £10 billion. The merger would create the largest player in the UK, but what does it mean for competition and consumers? Our business correspondent, Emma Simpson reports. It is all change in the mobile market, so what is the deal? The owner of Three mobile network is hoping to buy its rival, 02. It is a merger worth £10.25 billion. Together, they will have 33 million combined customers. And they have plenty of handsets to choose from. British consumers also enjoy some of the lowest mobile phone tariffs in Europe. The big question is, could prices go up if this latest industry deal goes ahead? It was only a few years ago that Britain had five mobile operators. Orange and T-Mobile are combined to create EE which is set to be bought by BT. Now the owner of the smallest player, Three, is hoping to snap up 02, leaving three big providers. So what would it mean to customers? I don’t think we will see significant price rises for consumers in a near future as a result of this deal. But in other European countries, when the number of operators has fallen from four to three, is a reduction in the speed at which prices go down. In some cases, we have seen earlier occasions prices may be starting to rise in at least one of those markets. This year, Three customers can use their phones abroad... Three has been disrupting the UK market with its cut-price deals. Its owner is one of Asia’s richest tycoons. Li Ka-shing has a personal fortune of £22 billion. He employs 280,000 staff in 50 countries. And he has been investing heavily in the UK, with these just some of the companies he has bought. Three is set to be his biggest deal yet. Mobiles, we can’t live without them. As this market changes, what do consumers want? Better signal in all areas. We come from Scarborough. It is quite a bad signal down there. And overall UK coverage. Getting cheaper and more coverage. That is for the future. Now, this merger still has to be approved by the competition authorities, before a deal can be done. Our top story this evening. The broadcasters say the televised election debates will go ahead even if all the party leaders don’t take part. Still to come: jailed for 13 years - the former trader convicted of defrauding investors of £350 million. And cabbies’ anger at being excluded from Tottenham Court Road after it gets a multimillion pound facelift. The news that TV election debates are more likely to take place has been welcomed by the leader of the Green Party, Natalie Bennett. She will be invited to take part in two debates open to seven party leaders, including UKIP and the SNP. Support for the Greens has surged in recent months, partly because of the row over who should take part in the debates. Our deputy political editor james Landale has been to Bristol, where the Greens are targeting the student vote. If you want to understand why the Green Party have been offered a place in the TV election debates, you have to come to the university city of Bristol. Go Green in 2015I This is what the so-called Green surge means in practice. I am signing up, yes. Thousands of students and others, signing up tojoin a party that now has more members than the Lib Dems or Ukip. No wonder they and their leader are happy. Why did you join the Green Party? They’re the party with the best vision for the future of the country. I think it’s so fantastic, what you’re doing. The row over the Greens’ uncertain role in the TV debates has given the party unprecedented publicity and poll ratings as high as 11%. The people have had the chance to just hear a bit of our policies, things like making the minimum wage a living wage, if you work full time, you should earn enough money to live on, bringing the railways back into public hands, a publicly owned and publicly run NHS. People know more about us, and it’s clear they like what they’re hearing. Critics say the Greens are the Ukip of the left, hoovering up protest votes. But their unashamedly left-wing platform of higher taxes, more public spending and fewer border controls appeals to some, if not all. Why would you vote Green? Because I care about the environment and the city. In my wildest dreams, yes, I could look at voting Green. But they would have to change their policies first, because where they are at the moment is barking mad. Here in Bristol, a university survey suggests that almost half of all students might vote Green, giving the party hope that they could win the seat. But the impact of the Greens at this election may come not from winning seats, but from winning votes off Labour and the Lib Dems in seats like this and elsewhere, votes that could stop Ed Miliband becoming prime minister. For now, the Greens are riding a surge of support. The question is how far it will take them. james Landale, BBC News, in Bristol. The current rules on cosmetic surgery should be changed so that surgeons can’t carry out surgery beyond their specialisms - that’s the recommendation from the Royal College of Surgeons. It comes in the wake of the PIP breast implant scandal, when women were given products unfit for medical use. Sophie Hutchinson reports. Cosmetic surgery, described by ministers as a cowboy industry, the scandal of substandard breast implants in 2010 affected some 400,000 women in 65 countries around the world. That prompted today’s recommendations, which aim to improve safety, and notjust in relation to implants. Former Scottish footballer Colin Hendry’s wife died after liposuction punished her bowel. She underwent operations to correct the damage, but never recovered. The surgeon was reckless in what he did. He punctured her bowel seven or eight times in the two parts of the bowel. It was reckless. With so much information available nowadays to help patients choose the best place to be treated, it is striking how out of step the cosmetic surgery industry has become. It is not clear how many operations take place each year, which doctors are performing them or even whether they have been successful. Now, forthe even whether they have been successful. Now, for the first time, the Royal College of Surgeons is proposing a register of doctors who have the skills to carry out proper -- who have the skills to carry out proper-- cosmetic procedures. It believes it will help stop malpractice. Surgeons will have to present a portfolio of their experience and training, and also undergo a basic course on the differences between corrective surgery and cosmetic surgery so that we can certify them as being competent to do this in an independent practice. But the proposed scheme is voluntary, and surgeons who are specially trained in cosmetic procedures say it will only work if it is compulsory. It is a shame it doesn’t go further in thatitis a shame it doesn’t go further in that it is only a voluntary register. That means it cannot really be policed. So it still leaves patients vulnerable to anybody out there who wants to call themselves a cosmetic surgeon. Pressure is now growing on the regulator and the government to make it illegal for unskilled doctors to carry out cosmetic procedures. A pub chef and his manager have been jailed after Christmas dinner at their rush got left a 46 you old woman dead and dozens killed with food poisoning. They served really did Turkey at the railway hotel in Hornchurch in December two years ago. Today, they were sentenced to 12 and 18 months respectively for perverting the course ofjustice. The owners of the pub chain were fined £1.5 million. Cambridge United - they’re a League Two team worth precisely nothing. Most of their players are free transfers. And tonight they’re facing Manchester United, the richest club in Britain, in the FA cup fourth round tie. But their manager, Richard Money, says they could win. joe Wilson is there - fighting talk? A few tourists braved the cold on Friday morning. The river Cam is the tourist trail through a city which may be cast as a football backwater. Was much of -- may be cast as a football backwater. Was much of-- while most of Kennewick’s architecture is old and splendid, the football ground is just old, unchanged in places since the 1950s -- just old, unchanged in places since the 1950s -- Cambridge’s architecture. But the club is on a roll. Cambridge are holding their own to capture interest and money like no other. Two years ago, I had this ambition that outside of this ground, I would this ambition that outside of this ground, Iwould put ground, I would put sold out, and that was when we were getting 1600 in. Today, that sign has gone up, and that gives me pleasure. 8000 head tonight, most hoping for a home win. When you are an elite professional, everyonejust win. When you are an elite professional, everyone just expects you to make smooth progress. But they may be watching and hoping that you will secretly slipped up. I’m talking about Manchester United. For them, this season, the FA Cup is the one chance to win something. That is unusual, and they are treating Cambridge like giants. It is not easy to beat Cambridge United. They have five or six players above one metre 90, so it is difficult for us to defend. You have the ingredients of an upset, in that the small side is in form. If the smaller side is out of form, it does not matter how the bigger side is, they will probably go through. Last season, Cambridge won at Wembley twice, hence the trophies. Winning the FA Cup, the chairman told me, would cause a problem. He will have to buy a new table. And just ten years ago, Cambridge United were on the verge of extinction. Getting from there to here has been a long-term process for Dave and several other people involved in Cambridge United. Next, the club would like to move to a new stadium. To do that, they need to prove that there is interest in football in Cambridge. This match has given them the perfect opportunity. They say they could have sold out this ground ten times over. I’m sure it is true. And the beauty of it is that this evening, whatever unfolds in this game, you can see it and hear it live on the BBC. It’s thought to be the world’s oldest gardening book and it belonged to King Henry VIII. Now new research suggests that it transformed Henry into a green-fingered monarch. For centuries, it’s been kept in the private royal library, but now it’s about to go on display at Buckingham Palace, as Roya Nikkhah reports. He’s best known for his love of hunting, women and wine. But now, it seems that Henry VIII may have harboured another secret passion. This ancient book has been studied closely by experts for the first time. They now believe Henry thumbed through its pages when he wanted ideas on how to plant his own majestic garden. We know that he was influenced by it and there is information about pruning and grafting. Many elements in the book appear very contemporary for modern day gardeners. It includes advice on how to grow herbs and roses fit for a king, as well as tips on water features and even how to produce giant leeks. I think this shows us that Henry saw gardening as a way to increase his power and establish Tudor credentials, and it is another unknown aspect of Henry’s method of kingship. How do we know that Henry followed the book’s advice? Here in the Haunted Gallery at Hampton Court, there is a tantalising clue about how Henry put his green fingers into practice. This painting shows the king and his family at Whitehall Palace with his freshly planted garden behind them. The garden no longer exists, but here we can see rows of herbs, high garden walls and walkways, all features mentioned in Henry’s book. It is only when experts looked at this painting again, together with the book, that they realised the king was something of a secret gardener. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Louise Lear. Many across England and Wales woke UP Many across England and Wales woke up to a scene from Narnia this morning, with widespread frost and lows down to minus nine degrees. Different story further north. Here, we had a fair amount of cloud and temperature sat at around two Celsius. I suspect that tomorrow, the frost will be further north. To the south, we have a fair amount of cloud and rain moving through overnight, said temperatures will stay above freezing. Some of the rain is heavy as it pushes through the peaks and the Pennines. It continues to move south and east. Behind it, clearer, colderweather kicks in and we will see rumbles of thunder and snow showers at low levels. With those showers and temperatures around freezing, there could be icy surfaces first thing in the morning. Those showers are driven along by a brisk north-westerly breeze which will continue through the day. For the rest of England and Wales, it is a sunny story. A bit colder than today. But that cold feel is short lived. Yet again, whether fans start to push in from the Atlantic. They will introduce a south-westerly flow, dragging up milder air. will introduce a south-westerly flow, dragging up milderair. So there is a fair amount of cloud sandwiched between the two whether funds on Sunday. That will bring rain, mostly in the far north-west. Patchy rain along west facing coasts. Further east, we see brightness across Aberdeenshire towards the East Pennines. Out of the West, mild again. 10 degrees is not out of the question. So something for everyone this weekend. If you like your dessert dished up cold but sunny, Saturday is for you. By Sunday, it is mild and cloudy. Enjoy your weekend. A reminder of our main story.

The pub back manager panicked and decided to forge records about how exactly the food had been prepared and enlisted the head chef to do the same. The cover up meant investigators have never got to the bottom of how exactly the turkey had become so dangerous. But at the heart of it was the cooking, cooling and reheating mentored, frequently used safely in the catering industry. Food is cooked and cool down too slowly, actively can multiply and thatis slowly, actively can multiply and that is what we think happened in this case. We very rarely see anybody wrecked -- this case. We very rarely see anybody wrecked -- die from food poisoning. The court finds the pub owners £1.5 million for placing under safe food on the market, charges that the manager and chef were cleared. But they will both served 18 months and 12 months in prison for perverting the course of justice. There’s lots more to come before the end of the programme, including: Cutting traffic on Tottenham Court Road. But why not everyone’s pleased at plans to give the area a multimillion pound redesign. Dramatic video footage has emerged of the moment a have a go hero was threatened with a machete after he tried to stop a gang robbing a jewellers in Liverpool Street. It happened yesterday afternoon and Marc Ashdown has more details of what happened. ~ Iamjusta I am just a few feet from Liverpool Street station. Thousands of people come through here every day. Yesterday lunch time, there was a brazen smash and grab raid on this exclusive jewellers. High belly exclusive jewelle rs. High belly watches exclusive jewellers. High belly watches and diamonds, targeted by a Gang watches and diamonds, targeted by a gang of three. They tried to escape on mopeds and got more than they bargained for. Lunch time in a bubble is to it, a gang of three robbers burst from the jewellers. They smashed their way into using sledgehammers and now tried to escape on scooters but one brave castle by is having none of it. The smartly dressed man jumps castle by is having none of it. The smartly dressed manjumps on one of the thieves. But when he pulled out a large machete, he has to let go. A plain closed police officer tried to chase but he truth threatens and the suspect escapes. The damage was extensive. Today, the shop was back open, though not displaying anything. Some of the watches on sale here are words up to £50,000. Witnesses praised the have a go hero for bravely trying to tackle this dangerous gang. Amazingly, no one was injured. Thanks in no small part to his actions, police have arrested one of the thieves. To remain at large. City of London Police are appealing for anyone who saw anything to get in touch with them. One of the shop owners across the road said police have been in and told him police were acting positionally in the area. -- suspiciously. A London Underground worker is being treated in hospital after being stabbed in the face this morning at Lancaster Gate tube station. Paramedics were called at around 10.45 following an incident in the booking hall. A lio-year-old man has been arrested. Wandsworth and Richmond councils have announced plans merge services and staffing. Unions have warned that the proposals, expected to be brought in for 2017, Borisjohnson is urging the Borisjohnson is urging the government to supply sophisticated weaponry to Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State terrorists in northern Iraq. The London Mayor, who’s on a visit to the Kurdish regional capital Irbil, said thMinisters are being urged to not While Britain has sent some arms to the Kurds, more were needed. Iwas very proud to see what British troops were doing, the training we are probing in heavy machine guns and so on, in my view, this is something we could intensify. One of the cases there will be taking back to London is that these guys are really on the front line of the struggle that affects everybody in Western Europe, everybody in Britain and also in London. Ministers are being urged to not spend so much money on London’s railways and instead share the money more evenly across the whole of the UK. MPs on the Transport Select Committee are concerned that so much investment in the railways is concentrated here, although as our transport correspondent Tom Edwards reports, there are reasons for the discrepancy. Commuting can be an ordeal with overcrowding trains and increasing fares. London Bridge is currently being rebuilt. That investment will be welcome in the long term but it continues to cause problems. A nightmare. It took me three hours to get home one night last week. There has been delay after delay. Last week was very horrible. But this week, so far so good. Why do they sell tickets to us if they know the trains will not run? It has been a difficult few weeks the Network Rail. Engineering upgrade works caused disruption at King’s Cross and Pennington. Today, a report outlined concerns that the company cannot cope. It also criticised how old stock from the capital is moved from the rest of the country and funding is unfairly skewed towards London. We thus look at the whole of the country. Investment is very important and more people use trains. Other parts of the country need investment, two, but that is to improve their economies and support jobs outside of London as well as on it. The capital does get more investment and other areas butjust over 1.1 billionjourneys investment and other areas butjust over 1.1 billion journeys are over 1.1 billionjourneys are made in London and the south-east, that is nearly 70% of all journeys. in London and the south-east, that is nearly 70% of alljourneys. But commuters in Leeds think London get a better deal. The parliament staff are in London and there is a lot of emphasis on London and the Home Counties. There is a definite divide. £38 million will be spent on the rail networks. With elections looming, where and how it is spent is under intense scrutiny. Do you think this will have an impact on London’s commuters? The majority of the railjourneys and revenue is in London. And don’t forget, London is grabbing at an extremely fast rate. I have a statement from the Department for Transport. They say they are investing record amounts in building a world-class railway across the country. We want to improve services for every customer and help close the economic gap between North and South. The founder of one of London’s oldest hedge funds has beenjailed after committing what’s believed to be the largest fraud of it’s kind ever anywhere in Europe. Magnus Peterson worked out of his office in Mayfair, defrauding charities, pension schemes and companies out of over £350 million. Described as greedy and arrogant, Magnus Peterson conned charities out of millions of pounds. He would lose illegal trade is to inflate his funds performance. It affected abroad range of people. Charities lost millions of dollars. Individuals have been made and crop. It is notjust affected large institutions, and effectively blame the US, Sweden and England. Criminal proceedings started when his home was raided in April 2009. Two years later, he was informed by the Serious Fraud Office that no further action would be taken. That decision was criticised by the judge. Earlier this week, he was found guilty of multiple counts of forgery and fraud. The judge said he didn’t know whether it was the arrogance of greed of the December led to his actions. You said he had run a clever and dishonest scheme, the lead to be the largest fraud in its nature in the largest -- lead to be the largest fraud in its nature in the largest -- in history. It was thought that the cases were too difficult forjury It was thought that the cases were too difficult for jury trials but this case has shown it is not the case. We can present complex, financial cases in a way thatjuries can understand. All weird on a smaller scale than Bernie made of,... He will spend 13 years behind ours. He is bankrupt and he -- of,... He will spend 13 years behind ours. He is bankrupt and he -- his reputation is in tatters. Cars, lorries and even taxis will be banned from driving down Tottenham Court Road as plans get the go-ahead to redesign the area, in time for the opening of its Crossrail station in 2018. The revamp is aimed to make the road safer and cut pollution but the proposal could now be challenged in court, as Chris Rogers reports. Every hour, 12,000 pedestrians fill this area. Every year, 66 million passengers travel on buses here. It is not the best looking street in London, West End but... When Crossrail is completed in 2018, Tottenham Court Road will be twice as busy as Heathrow Airport. Congestion, pollution and safety have been long-standing issues. This is Tottenham Court Road ‘s ÂlI1 million face-lift. As for wider pavements, segregated cycle paths and five new open spaces, including a part, have been largely welcomed during public consultation but there was a catch, there will be no entry signs for cars, lorries and black cabs from ATM until 7pm Monday to Saturday. There are concerns that could be bad for business and congestion on surrounding streets. Proposals on this scale always create divisions and not everybody can be satisfied and there has been some compromise but they risk particular anger amongst taxi drivers. We pick up and set down an awful lot of people in this road. Many of them disabled and they will not be able to get here and have the benefit of London’s only 100% disability and access transport at their disposal. This traffic is not going to go away, it will go somewhere else. We have torched two groups that represent disabled people and they were concerned about access to the hospitals. We have accommodated that and it is important to recognise that it will be much better in terms of accessibility for the -- be much better in terms of accessibility for the -- with the new train station. The council is ploughing on with the scheme and work is due to begin this summer. The licensed taxi Association are applying for a judicial review. Still to come. The show must go on. Producers turn to candlelight during a production. And celebrating the creations of Alexander McQueen. His friends welcome the forthcoming V&A work. To have his work represented in the city where it all began will be truly, truly amazing. This weekend is said by some to be magical in the world of sport. Here to explain why is Sara Orchard. We’re all hoping for a bit of FA Cup magic as it’s the fourth round and there’s still a healthy handful of clubs in and around the capital still dreaming of Wembley glory. One of them is Tottenham who’ll play out a repeat of the 1961 Cup final when they host Leicester tomorrow. To keep across all this weekend’s Cup action our radio station BBC On Wednesday night, Tottenham needed a helping hand. Townsend, guess, Tottenham have the lead. Like Chelsea, Tottenham of the only other London clubs still battling it out in four competitions and success in either domestic cup will send them to their first Wembley final in six years. I don’t think they are that bothered how they get to Wembley, as long as they get there. With the team playing as well as they are, it would be considered a huge disappointment if they were not to add silverware at Wembley. Still a bitter frost around the outskirts here but hang goodness for the undersoil heating. The club is competing in four different competitions but the FA Cup, the oldest cup competition in the hold world still has its chance and bond memories for the Tottenham faithful. Now less than this weekend when they will host Leicester in a repeat of the 1961 cup final when Spurs were going for the league and cup double and didn’t disappoint their crowd. With the pressure continuing to press from four directions, the manager is happy to take each game as it comes but admits English football is intense. In England, it is a very difficult country to play football because it is tough. If you are in the Europa League, it never stops. You play a lot of games. Leicester at home, I think this is mY Leicester at home, I think this is my mentality always. As the fiction list remains -- my mentality always. As the fiction list remains -- there was no desire for it to start cooling down just yet. To keep across all this weekend’s Cup action our radio station BBC London 94.9 will have all the goals, featuring full commentary of Crystal Palace’s trip to Southampton. On digital radio, you can follow Fulham’s fortunes on the road at Sunderland. All matches kick off at 3pm. On Sunday, there are two digital commentaries as West Ham go to Bristol City at 2pm, followed by Arsenal away to Brighton at 4pm. Now, before we leave the FA Cup, how do you fancy not just going but singing this at the Cup final? The Hymn Abide With Me has been sung out at every final since 1927 and the BBC wants to hear about your Cup memories to win a place as part of very special 2015 FA Cup Choit. For all the details, just go to the Songs Of Praise website. Onto rugby now and Saracens are travelling to central France for a winner takes all clash with Clermont-Auvergne tomorrow in the European Champions Cup. After Sarries beat Munster in north London last weekend the victorious side at the sold-out Stade Marcel Michelin will guarantee a place in the quarterfinals. And finally some cricket, England one-day captain and middlesex batsman Eoin Morgan has said revelations of a blackmail plot did not put him off hisjob of skippering England as they lost to Australia in the tri-series today. The 28-year-old was the victim of a five-figure blackmail attempt after an alleged relationship with an Australian woman five years ago. Morgan was out for a duck in the match in Hobart, saying afterwards that matters away from the pitcAn exhibition at the Victoria and The show must go on. An added most actors have had to say. In west London last mind, it was very much put to the test. A power cut during the performance threatened abduction but the company decided to improvise and continue. They are not taking any chances with the lighting at the Barons Court Theatre in west London. A power cut left them in doctors for more than two hours in the middle of last night’s performance. -- two hours in the middle of last night’s performance. -- left them in darkness. It was quite funny. We decided to stop and see what was going on and once we realised it would carry on longer, we thought, the show has to go on. We grabbed as many candles as we could and bought them down and let them all. It would have been such a shame, we would just getting started. It is such an atmospheric, emotional play anyway. I think because it is quite still here at the table, and a pure storytelling, it worked really well in the candlelight. I met herfor the first time that night. Watching TV in her make do granny flat. The audience all stayed in their seats while engineers from the power company worked to restore the actress added. In the end, the candles did the trick. I thought it was quite amusing. My friend bought it was part of the show at first. The actress onstage made a good gag about it because she has just had a line about turning on the kettle and then all the lights failed and she said and the lights, which is quite funny. No one knew quite what to do or expect. It wasn’tjust funny. No one knew quite what to do or expect. It wasn’t just the theatre affected by the blackout, pubs and restaurants across this part of west London had to close their doors and with a traffic light is not working, there was chaos on the roads as well. just one sugar, please. I don’t, the roads as well. just one sugar, please. Idon’t, normally. please. I don’t, normally. The local fault was prepared but in a statement, UK power network said they are still investigating the wider problem. In the meantime, residents and businesses in west London are making sure they have plenty of candles. An exhibition at the Victoria and Albert museum has been extended - with an extra 50 thousand tickets going on sale - before it’s even opened. Alexander McQueen’s Savage Beauty exhibition has proved so popular the V&A says to meet public demand. Alexander McQueen was one of the most inventive designers of his generation. A posthumous retrospective of his work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York proved a phenomenal ex--- success. More than 50,000 tickets have been released to meet demand, a record for advanced sales in the V&A. He was interested in fashion history, he was interested in film, he has a lot of different influences in his collections. As a result, the creations he made and this exhibition under V&A, have a wider interest than we would normally anticipate for a fashion exhibition. For his London outings, this exhibition will be edited and expanded for that the end they’s large exhibition galleries, including one-off pieces from private collections and showcase designers produced by Alexander McQueen with other creatives. The jewel assuredly was a friend and worked with him for over 20 years. Their collaboration will be in the London outing of this exhibition. Did he always have a clear idea of 40 wanted when he came to do? It was very case-by-case. Sometimes, he would say this is the piece I want, like the skeleton corset in the V&A exhibition. He knew what he wanted. He had a vision. I think to see it coming back to the BMj, to be here in London where he was born, it is like the boy is coming home. I really feel that to have his body of work represented in the city where it all began will be truly, truly amazing. Alexander McQueen had often expressed the desire to appeal to a wider audience. With the worldwide popularity of this exhibition, his dream has been realised. It opens on the 14th of March. It looks like a fantastic exhibition. Let’s take a look at the weather now. Last night, what a cold night. It was it. I have to show you this picture behind me. This is sent in by and through. You can see how crisp the fields are behind us. It was very cold last night. It was the coldest night of the winter so far for England but it won’t be repeated tonight, -9. That is because we have all this cloud heading our way. Many of us will have some rain on this weather front. Temperatures are very low at the moment. Only around 2 degrees. As it comes across the Chilterns and the downs, they could be a smattering of sleet and snow but it is mostly rain. It clears away and temperatures all know where near as low as last mind, once and two is generally but that is low enough for the roads to freeze. They could be some hill fog as well. The frost will lift tomorrow but it looks like a laborious day. Crisp and sunny. The breeze will be bracing but the sunshine will more than make up for it. Tomorrow night, a little frost again, perhaps a little colder because we will not have the weather system around to start with. Watch out for freezing fog and icy patches first thing Sunday. We have a ridge of high pressure influencing our area on Sunday, although it will get milder and wetter elsewhere. Sunday, it is not looking too bad. A cold, crisp start. We will have more cloud than Saturday but it should be almost leads right, reasonably bright, still quite chilly, but later in the day, the temperatures. To rise with the approach of the weather front and as we go into Monday, or rain. It won’t be as cold as last night. Before we go, this Friday evening, a reminder of the main news headlines. Britain ‘s main broadcasters have revised proposals for pre-election debates and say they will take place evenif debates and say they will take place even if one or more of the invited party leaders refuses to come. Waiting times in all types of A&E departments have improved to their best level since November but the main target is still being missed. The new ruler of Saudi Arabia says there will be no change in policy in the world’s largest exporter. The 79 new bold succeeded his half brother who died last night, aged 90. The chef and manager of a pub in one church have beenjailed after customer died from food poisoning. They served reheated Christmas dinner. And dramatic video footage has emerged of the moment have a go hero was threatened with the machete after he tried to stop a gang robbing a jewellers in Liverpool Street yesterday afternoon. That is it for now. I will be back later during the Ten O’Clock News on BBC night. join me with McBusted, Sir David Attenborough, Harry Hill, Gary Lineker and jessica Chastain.

I am going to have a makeover afterwards. This week, some of the ladies and gentlemen in the press may have misinterpreted something you said about Winston Churchill. I do not have a complaint about what they said I said because I did say it in a documentary that airs next week. It is about the funeral of Churchill, which is an amazing and lavish occasion. I said, there is no denying that he was, on occasions, and egotist, a workaholic and, sometimes, a bit of a charlatan. It does not detract from the fact he is an amazing leader who had an incredible ability to encapsulate ",,

Also tonight: Laid to rest in an unmarked grave - Saudi Arabia’s King Abullah is buried in Riyadh as his half-brother takes the throne. Showing signs of improvement - England’s A&E waiting times get better for the second week in a row, but they’re still below target. A big shake-up inthe mobile phone market as 02 looks set to be snapped up by a rival for more than £10 billion. A shock for Manchester United as they’re held to a goaless draw by League 2 Cambridge. And on the eve ofthe 50th anninversary of Churchill’s death, we remember Britain’s great wartime leader. We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields. We shall never surrender. Tonight on BBC London: A hedge fund manager from Mayfair is jailed for committing one ofthe biggest frauds ever seen in Europe. And see more of this have-a-go hero - who tackled a machete wielding robber. Good evening. Television broadcasters say they intend to hold three leaders debates before the general election, even if some parties decide not to take part. In total, seven leaders have been invited to participate inthe debates, but political parties from Northern Ireland have expressed anger that they’ve been left out ofthe plans. The decision comes after broadcasters failed to reach agreement with the political parties over the original proposals, which only included the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems and UKIP. Here’s our deputy political editor, james Landale. Five years ago, it was all so simple - three debate, with three leaders. Watched at least in part by more than 20 million people. Contests that dominated the election and some say helped shape the outcome. Our economy is stuck in a rut. Tonight’s debate is about you. There’s a lot to thisjob and debate is about you. There’s a lot to this job and as you saw yesterday, I don’t get all of it right. Five years on, and there’s less consensus and more complication. Today, the broadcasters invited no fewer than seven party leaders to take part and warned they will press ahead with the debates regardless of who turns up. David Cameron said he would not take part unless the Greens were invited. Now they are. Not surprisingly, they are chuffed. It is clear the future of politics does not look like the past. We’re in a multi-party age. That is really good. We are getting a broader rage of political views being presented to viewers. Under the latest proposals from the broadcasters there could be three debates. One between Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband. Two more, including them andthe leaders ofthe Lib Dems, UKIP, the Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru. They would take place every two weeks in the final run-up to May 7th. The Prime Minister is accused of wanting to chicken out ofthe debates, something his allies deny. Either way, the broadcasters are determined that no-one can stop the debates by refusing to turn up. The ball is again inthe Prime Minister’s court. I am waiting to hear the next excuse - I’m washing my hair that night - whatever it might be. Nigel Farage is keen to debate. To some, these plans for seven-strong debates show Britain is moving close tore the multi-party politics of Europe. To others, it is a recipe of chaos. Both for those taking part and those left out in the cold. Well, I think the party leaders’ debates are now descending into farce. just in case the BBC and ITV are not aware of it, Northern Ireland is an integral part ofthe UK If this is where they want to go, then clearly there’s no argument against Sinn Fein being involved as well. We represent a lot of people and we have exactly the same number of MPs as the Green Party. The opinion polls suggest the debates five years ago helped many voters get a better understanding ofthe issues and decide how to vote. For others, they were just a good watch. Whether they will get the chance to watch again is still not certain. Let’s speak to our Deputy Political Editor, james Landale, who’s at Westminter for us. james, is that it now - these debates will definitely go ahead? It is not sure these debates will go ahead. We moved a step towards them taking part today. But nothing is guaranteed. There are substantial obstacles inthe way. The Conservatives don’t want all these debates crammed into the last month of the these debates crammed into the last month ofthe campaign. The Lib Dems don’t want Clegg excluded from one where he cannot defend his record in Government. UKIP are not thrilled that Nigel Farage has been relegated with seven party leaders when he thought he had been going up against Cameron, Clegg and Miliband. Labour while they say they will accept whatever the broadcasters offer, I understand there are concerns about giving the SNP some kind of national status in a UK-wide election. So, the talks continue. The negotiations go on. And at the same time, an awful lot of political manoeuvring because if these debates go belly-up, no party wants to get the blame. Thank you. World leaders, including David Cameron, will travel to Saudi Arabia tomorrow to pay their respects to King Abdullah who died last night. He was buried in a traditional ceremony inthe captial Riyadh. The new ruler of Saudi Arabia, his half-brother, King Salman, spoke publicly within hours of his accession and said there will be no change of direction for the country. Frank Gardner reports. This report contains some flash photography. Wrapped in a simple shroud, the body of King Abdullah, laid to rest today. 90 years old, he died of pneumonia. The world’s oldest monarch. Buried in an unmarked grave. His death was expected, but many are mourning. To them he was a symbol of stability in turbulent times. I cannot describe my feelings. From early morning, everybody was upset when we heard the news. He was more than a father. He meant a lot to us. He meant a lot to world leaders too. Saudi Arabia’s enormous oil wealth has made it one ofthe West’s biggest trading partners. King Abdullah was a firm ally ofthe West. At home, he had to tread a careful path so not to antagonise the deeply religious clerics. Saudi Arabia remains the only country in the world where women are forbidden to drive. There are lots of practises in Saudi Arabia which do not sit comfortably with the practises in Britain. One ofthe things which King Abdullah did was he modernised the country substantially. For example, today there substantially. For example, today there are more women in higher education than there are men in Saudi Arabia. This would have been unthinkable a few years back. Saudi women need a male relative’s permission to travel or marry. You can be a millionaire. You can be a successful business woman, yet you need a man to manage your day-day business. You still need a man to sign you out, to leave the country. You will still need a man to drive you around. The Saudi Government has opened books of condolences at embassies around the world, like this one. King Abdullah is being genuinely mourned by large parts of his population. His critics say his reforms did not go far enough, that human rights abuses are rife and that the Saudi authorities must learn how to tolerate peaceful dissent without locking people up on terrorism. Given these concerns, there is consternation in some quarters, including some MPs. Today flags have flown at half- mast in of Whitehall. The new Saudi monarch is from the Old Guard. He is thought unlikely to embark on reforms and there are questions about his health. If you saw the speech he gave, it did not sound good. He was mumabling. He seemed spacey. Somewhat unsure how to inflect meaning tothe words in his speech. Tonight, King Salman has been receiving oaths of allegiance from his countrymen. Tomorrow he will receive world leaders, like David Cameron, keen to cement their ties with arguably the most important Arab country. The number of people arrested inthe UK for suspected terrorist offences linked to Syria has risen significantly. In 2013, 25 people were detained for offences, including preparing an act of terrorism and attending a terrorist training camp. In 2014, that number rose to 165. The first batch of an experimental vaccine against Ebola is its way on to Liberia. Scientists aim to test the vaccine on 30,000 volunteers, including frontline health workers. Hospital waiting times in England’s Accident & Emergency departments have improved for a second week in a row. New figures show that more than 92% of patients were seen within four hours last week. However, there are warnings that measures to improve care in A&E departments may be having an unwelcome impact on other hospital patients. Here’s our Health Editor, Hugh Pym. The latest from the front line of Accident & Emergency. The pressure has reduced. Rose, who had a fall at home, is pleased she got to see a doctor fairly quickly at this hospital in Middlesbrough. I was frozen stiff in the two minutes between getting out ofthe ambulance and getting into hospital. Apart from that, everything went well and I have not had any delays at all. The weekly figures from England show that A&E attendance fell from just under 390,000 to 377,000 last week. The percentage seen within four hours also improved, up from under 90%, to 92.4%. But delayed discharge from hospital rose from 4,000 patients to 4,200. The flow of patients into hospitals through Accident & Emergency units has eased, although it is only one week’s figures. The question is why that might have happened, after all the pressure earlier inthe month. There was a fall inthe number of calls to the NHS 111 helpline. Critics say this winter it has been referring too many patients to A&E. NHS England argues it has resulted in people being given other options. Perhaps people were put off going to A&E because of headlines about long waits. There does not seem to be a simple explanation. It is difficult to know if this is a sustained improvement. From my experience, you get quieter weeks. This week, we have definitely seen a difference inthe number of patients attending and I don’t know why that is. We will have to see over the next couple of weeks if it is a sustained improvement. When it comes to moving people out of hospital, particularly the elderly back into the community, there are still major problems, which means beds are occupied for longer, making it hard to find space for new patients. There are knock-on effects for other patients too. Those waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment are now at the highest level since the target was introduced seven years ago. In order to accommodate those emergency patients, hospitals have to do things like cancel non-emergency operations and we’ve seen the cancellation rate go right up this winter. So, you can see the pressure moving from A&E into the other parts ofthe hospital. The four-hour A&E waiting figures for England may have improved, be but they are still below the official 95% standard. Comparable data for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are published inthe coming weeks. ofthe country is now out of work. On Sunday Greeks will go to the polls to choose their next government. And it may well decide their future in Europe. If voters opt for the increasingly popular far left party Syriza then Greece could be on its way out ofthe Eurozone. Our Europe editor Gavin Hewitt reports from Athens. The last hours of campaigning in a Greek election that has Europe’s leaders on edge, fearful that the result could spark a fresh crisis inthe Eurozone. It is streets like this in Ymittos that reveal a country worn down by economic collapse. This man is a tailor. I work from 8am until 9pm every day, he says, and still I can’t afford the bills. This suit has been left here for two years. He can’t even afford to pick it up, and there are many more like it, just left behind. just along the street is the local taverna. TRANSLATION: Two or three years ago you would see double the number of people here. Now most ofthe taverna is empty. just these people here - they ask the price of everything. It is this perception that austerity has brought widespread hardship that dogs the campaign ofthe Conservative Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. He insists that tough medicine in exchange for an EU bailout has made Greece reliable again. During the past two and a half years the country managed to stand on its feet, he said tonight, and this was done step-by-step. People did suffer and people are still suffering, but we set the grounds for recovery. His rival and the man ahead inthe polls is the radical left politician, Alexis Tsipras. Ha’s promised that Monday will see the beginning ofthe end of austerity and he’s promised to renegotiate the terms ofthe EU bailout deals. His opponents see him as dangerous and naive. I think Mr Tsipras is reckless. What do you think would happen if Mr Tsipras becomes Prime Minister? I think Greece will be destroyed. But the radical left party says Greece must face up to the reality of what happened here. There are people out there on the streets of Athens who are sleeping rough tonight, who are going hungry. Why? Because of his policy of pretending that Greece never went bankrupt. All the indications are that the radical left party will win on Sunday and if that happens it will send shock waves through Europe. Its leader, Alexis Tsipras, has said he wants to keep Greece inthe euro, but he has also said that he’s preparing for a major confrontation with Greece’s creditors. Britain’s mobile phone market is about to undergo a big shake up. 02 is set to be bought by its rival, Three, in a deal worth more than £10 billion. The merger would create the largest player inthe UK, but what does it mean for competition and consumers? Our business correspondent Emma Simpson reports. It’s all change in the mobile market, so what’s the deal? The owner of Three mobile network is hoping to buy its rival, 02. It’s a merger worth £10.25 billion. Together, they’ll have 33 million combined customers. And they have plenty of handsets to choose from. British consumers also enjoy some ofthe lowest mobile phone tariffs in Europe. The big question is, could prices go up if this latest industry deal goes ahead? It was only a few years ago that Britain had five mobile operators. Orange and T-Mobile combined to create EE, which is set to be bought by BT. Now the owner ofthe smallest player, Three, is hoping to snap up 02, leaving three big providers. So what would it mean to customers? I don’t think we will see significant price rises for consumers inthe nearfuture as a result of this deal. But in other European countries, when the number of operators has fallen from four to three, is a reduction in the speed at which prices go down. In some cases, we have seen earlier indications prices may be starting to rise in at least one of those markets. This year, Three customers can use their phones abroad... Three has been disrupting the UK market with its cut-price deals. Its owner is one of Asia’s richest tycoons. Li Ka-shing has a personal fortune of £22 billion. He employs 280,000 staff in 50 countries. And he’s been investing heavily inthe UK, with these just some ofthe companies he’s bought. Three is set to be his biggest deal yet. Mobiles, we can’t live without them. As this market changes, what do consumers want? Better signal in all areas. We come from Scarborough. It’s quite a bad signal down there. And overall UK coverage. Getting cheaper and more coverage. That’s for the future. For now, this merger still has to be approved bythe competition authorities, before a final deal can be done. A pub chef and his manager have both beenjailed after a Christmas dinner at their restaurant left a 46-year-old woman dead and dozens of others ill with food poisoning. Mehmet Kaya and Ann-Marie McSweeney served reheated turkey at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch in December two years ago. Today, they were sentenced to 12 and 18 months respectively for perverting the course ofjustice. The pub’s owners were fined £1.5 million. The energy supplier Npower is to cut standard tariff gas prices by an average ofjust over 5% from February 16. The company is the fourth ofthe so-called Big Six energy suppliers to reduce its prices inthe wake of falling wholesale costs. Manchester United, the richest club in Britain, took on Cambridge United tonight - a League Two team worth precisely nothing- inthe FA Cup fourth round tie. And asjoe Wilson reports, the result was a bit of a shock. Yes, indeed. Some people came with sleeping bags at 4am to try to get tickets for this match. Cambridge reckon they could have sold 80,000, never mind 8000. The Lloris the idea ofthe Cup, the idea that 75 league places can be eliminated to nothing. That’s whatwe saw tonight. No goals, but loads of drama and perhaps above all else in this 0-0 draw, Cambridge has proved it is a football city. In Cambridge there is architecture that may inspire you, typically this, old and much admired. But some prefer the more the more rusting spires. A decade ago Cambridge United almost went bust. Manchester United inthe FA Cup, a reward. Everybody around the world knows about Cambridge for its university. Tonight, this match is beamed around the world and Cambridge United is what people are going to be talking about. TV money and record gate receipts, short-term gain, but if these supporters would brave the cold tonight, hopefully somewhat, gain. What can generate an atmosphere like this, at a club like this? Only the FA Cup. Tonight, Cambridge and Manchester are united. Which is the club with the £200 million wage bill? That’s Manchester United, in white, desperately keeping Cambridge at bay. In the first half the home side enjoyed. Manchester spent more time with the ball as the game progressed, but thatis ball as the game progressed, but that is Chris Dunn inthe golfer Cambridge. Manchester United have substitutes like Robin Van Persia, a £24 million man. He came on and missed. Cambridge were revelling in levelling the playing field. Injury time, Chris Dunn stretching everything to keep the ball out. Financially there’s only one thing better than a victory, a replay. At Old Trafford. But for Cambridge this result means far more than simple money. Images from the Rosetta spacecraft have shed new light on the composition of a comet more than 300 million miles from Earth. The images come from Rosettas’s probe Philae, that managed to land on the comet’s surface last year The on-board cameras have revealed a wide range of surface features. They show obvious large holes which it’s believed were caused by explosions of gases. There is also surface scarring and cracking, again thought to be caused by force from within the comet. And there is even evidence of what look like sand dunes on the surface. Tomorrow is the 50th anniversary ofthe death of Winston Churchill. The wartime Prime Minister had a huge impact on Britain. His energy, defiance and resolve to win World War II, helped inspire the nation to eventual victory. Our world affairs Editorjohn Simpson looks back at Sir Winston’s life and his legacy. For most people, though not everyone agrees, he’s the greatest leader these islands have produced. And at the most critical moment in British history, he remained rock solid. When the onslaught happened after his warnings about it had long been ignored, his example encouraged the nation to endure the worst that Nazi Germany could do. His rhetoric united people and gave them hope. His greatest weapon was his growling voice, thrilling people with his fierce resolve. We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. in the fields and inthe streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. And he had that tremendous popular touch, as here in Downing Street, flashing Hitler his famous victory sign - sometimes the other way round. That’s the kind of thing we remember Churchill for most, of course. His humour and his defiance. He was a dominating figure, who could make his generals and ministers quail, but he could also be immensely generous, even to his political enemies and his superbly written books won him the Nobel Prize for Literature. There’s not another Prime Minister in British history who could possibly match all that. But does he have anything to tell today’s politicians about leadership? Well, as Borisjohnson, the Conservative Mayor of London says in a new book, Churchill insisted on finding things out for himself. He went to Germany to see what Hitler was like. One ofthe things that made Churchill such a brilliant leader was that he was a complete wonk. It’s an illusion to think that he was some guy, a rhetorician, a guy who skated over the issues. He was deeply immersed in all the detail and technicality and that helped him to get the right answer. But once the war against Hitler was won, none of this helped him inthe 1945 election. Churchill was still hugely popular, but he and his party had no real vision ofthe future to offer. To an historian from Churchill College, Cambridge, Churchill wasn’t a great leader. Churchill was fundamentally flawed. It was his military strategy, Gallipoli in World War I, which was replicated inthe Norwegian, North African andthe soft underbelly of Europe campaigns during the World War II, it was his economic strategy as Chancellor in the 1920s, the return to the gold standard, his attitude towards India and the Indians and indeed his post-war 51-55 Ministry, which was very lacklustre and very poor indeed. Today the state funeral service will laud the memory ofthe old warrior. Churchill’s funeral in 1965. The age of giants is over, said a famous historian, but that’s really Churchill’s great success. Because he destroyed Hitler’s despotism we haven’t needed our political leaders to be giants ever since. They canjust be ordinary. That’s all from us. Over on BBC Two Newsnight talks to a Saudi princess about what the death of King Abdullah means for Saudi Arabia. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening. I’m Asad Ahmad. A former hedge fund manager has been jailed after committing what’s believed to be the largest fraud of it’s kind ever, anywhere in Europe. Magnus Peterson defrauded charities, pension schemes and companies out of hundreds of millions of pounds from his office in Mayfair. Rebecca Williams reports. Described as greedy and arrogant, Magnus Peterson conned businesses and charities out of millions of pounds. From his former office in Mayfair he would use illegal trades to inflate his funds performance. It has affected a broad range of people, but it included pension funds and charities, who lost millions of dollars. Individuals have lost their businesses and individuals have been made bankrupt. It has notjust affected large institutions. It has affected people inthe US, Sweden and England, and their livelihoods have been destroyed. Criminal proceedings against the former trader started when his home was raided in April 2009. Two years later he was informed bythe Serious Fraud Office that no further action would be taken. That decision today was criticised by the judge. Earlier this week, he was found guilty of multiple counts of forgery and fraud. In court today, the judge said he didn’t know ",,

The fallout from the Greek general election is being felt across Europe this lunchtime. Finance ministers from the Eurozone are meeting in Brussels with the result top of the agenda. The new government, led by the anti-austerity Syriza party has pledged to renegotiate Greece’s massive international bailout. But this morning, the markets have been reacting uneasily to that victory. Let’s cross to Athens and Clive Myrie. After the celebrations overnight comes the hard work, notjust After the celebrations overnight comes the hard work, not just the filling the hopes and dreams of the millions of people who voted for Syriza, but the age austerity is coming to an end, but also convincing the international money markets, and crucially, the Germans, that this country can sort out its economic problems and renegotiate the bailout terms in a way that is advantageous to everybody. This morning, the party leader, Alexis Tsipras, finalised his coalition, and in about an hour he’ll be sworn in as the country’s youngest prime minister in 150 years. He isjust AO. Our first report this lunchtime is from our europe correspondent, Chris Morris. A triumphant night for the radical left with celebrations in Athens with anti-austerity policies taking centre stage in Greece and challenging the established European order. Now down to business, Alexis brass arriving at party headquarters this morning. -- brass arriving at party headquarters this morning. -- Alexis Tsipras, with the party from the right also sharing the same dislike of austerity and bailout. We have a government, he says, a willing coalition partner. So, no absolute majority for Syriza, but a government is emerging that fundamental eyrie rejects the policies from the EU and IMF -- fundamentally. The idea that strict budgeting is the only way to govern in the Eurozone is being challenged head-on. So, as the outgoing government’s selection marquee comes down, new economic ideas are coming into play. -- down, new economic ideas are coming into play. -- election. Syriza will spend more money in negotiating Greek debt, but it wants to stay in Europe. The idea of an X it or any turbulence in the European framework is out of the question. You will stay in the year-- Eurozone? We will stay in the Eurozone and stay within the framework institutionally of Europe. And with Syriza making all the headlines, there is little doubt why they won. They offered hopein doubt why they won. They offered hope in a country battered by five years of cuts, unemployment and a plummeting standing of living. -- standard of living. Think it inspires hope and change. I’m not certain they have what it takes to say what they will achieve, but let them try. I believe change will happen. They will do what they promised to do while in opposition. But much will now depend on the incoming Prime Minister. Alexis Tsipras has much to prove. He is walking the tightrope, although his headis walking the tightrope, although his head is full ofjunk in terms of political views and ideas, he is a quick learner. So the radical left are taking power in Europe for the first time in decades. A moment in the sun for Alexis Tsipras, but the hard work starts now, and he will not be given an easy ride. Money markets can help make or break a country’s economy in a construct like the Euro zone. The reaction so far from the markets has not been positive. This was the outcome that had been giving financial markets the jitters, had been giving financial markets thejitters, but the jitters, but the Euro has been bumping along the bottom anyway, going up slightly, and the clear result helped Greek shares, along with positive noises from the European politicians whom the new government will be asking for help. We stand ready to work with them, as we always worked with the previous Greek government, and hopefully we will start talks with them on the cooperation we have very soon. This is the scale of the Greek problem. The economy has been shrinking almost continuously since 2008, only ending the long recession last year. Greece’s national debt has soared to 175% of its national output, or GDP, one of the highest rates in the world. Its European partners and the International monetary fund have committed 240 billion euros in loans. They have to PaYÂ billion euros in loans. They have to pay, said a French member of the European Central Bank, although there could be a discussion of rescheduling the debt. A historic move to the left is how the German see it. What many Greeks voted for was debt forgiveness, but that idea gets short shrift. I don’t think it is a good result, at least from the German point of view, but it’s a mistake to the Greeks as well, I think. I hope that reason will prevail and that the Greeks will remain in the EU if we help them a bit. The UK is on the sidelines in finding a solution but the Chancellor, in Plymouth, said, we are affected. We are linked to the fortunes of Europe, so therefore today’s result in the Greek election will increase economic risk for us. Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels today to discuss Greece, preparing for what promises to be difficult negotiations. Simon converts. BBC News. The first crunch point could come next month as they renegotiate 200 billion Euros bailout money. How well the negotiations go could set the tone for the relationship between Greece and the rest of the Eurozone, a relationship that likely to be difficult. With that, it is back to you. Robert Heston is with me now. -- Robert Heston. Europe is very much holding its breath here. It is very striking that the market reaction has been muted today, and the reason is, last week we saw the European Central Bank announcing more than £1 trillion of quantitative easing, in our language, it’s going to spend a bit more than £1 trillion, sorry, £1 trillion, excuse me, buying government bonds. That is why the bonds of countries like Spain and Italy, which you would expect to suffer from the contagion of what has gone on in Greece, have actually risen today. They have not fallen. Investors are taking the view that that will insulate the vulnerable countries, but all eyes will be on these negotiations between the new government and the IMF. Brussels, if there is a debt write-off, that might set an interesting precedent for other Eurozone countries that have big debts. They might want a bit of that, and that would be expensive or the Eurozone. And if the talks fail, we may get back, and it is not what Syriza is saying at the moment, we might get back to the Greeks saying they want to leave the Eurozone, and in those circumstances I do not think Eurozone, and in those circumstances Ido not think we would have Eurozone, and in those circumstances I do not think we would have steady as she goes in terms of the markets. Libby Lane has made history by becoming the Church of England’s first woman bishop. 1,000 people packed into York Minster for the consecration which was led by the Archbishop of York, john Sentamu. The Right Reverend Libby Lane, who’ll become the new Bishop of Stockport, called it a ""profound and remarkable moment"". Let’s cross to York Minster and our correspondent, Danny Savage. A lovely atmosphere outside York Minster, Libby Lane, the new Bishop of Stockport emerged from the doors a few minutes ago to applause from everybody outside and had her photocall. This has been a very special day for her, and a very historical date for the Church of England. Clergy from all over the world are in York to date to take part in this historic event. joining them were parishioners from Libby Lane’s Church in Cheshire, coming to watch their vicar Church in Cheshire, coming to watch theirvicar being their vicar being made a bishop. It is absolutely fantastic. We are so proud of her. It is a wonderful day for us all. And for women. It is about time. I am proud of that, but Libby is deserving. The morning service, Libby Lane took her seat alongside her husband, who is also a vicar. A most traditional service for the most modern move of the Church of England, the appointment of their first female bishop. Ie Elizabeth jane, Holden Lane Clark, in holy orders, chosen bishop of the sea of Stockport... 1000 people were in York Minster for the ceremony, and speaking before the service, Libby Lane said it was an extraordinary privilege. Over the 20 years I have served Christ and his Church faithfully, that has been more than sufficient, day by day, but it is a huge honour to have been considered and I am very delighted, excited to have been asked. It is 21 years since the first women priests were appointed, and since then there have been debates, objections and votes on whether or not to have women bishops. One traditionalists -- traditionalist is Martindale, but he is here today to witness the change at the top. I am glad to be here, because I think it is important we are as one. That is what we are meant to be. We might not all agree on everything all the time, who does? But we have at least made a big stride to at least start the journey. made a big stride to at least start thejourney. The the journey. The service there was an objection when the Archbishop of York asked if she should be ordained, there was one dissenting voice. No, it is not in the Bible. With respect to speak to stop but it had little bearing on proceedings. The key moment in the service was when senior bishops laid their hands on Libby Lane, signalling her appointment to the higher echelons of the Church of England. Libby Lane’s title is now Bishop of Stockport, the first perhaps many women bishops in the future Church of England. I think it has to be said that the objection jarring the service was not unexpected. john Sentamu’s response as Archbishop of York was to read out a legal statement, if you like, saying there was nothing illegal whatsoever about Libby Lane being made a bishop and the service then carried on. No further objections were voiced. But it does show what the ups and downs have been here in the Church of England over the last couple of decades, with the services finished, Libby Lane is now Bishop, and she is now having her photograph taken with all of her fellow bishops as she goes into the future. And the bells go on. Danny, thank you very much. And later in the programme we’ll be speaking to one of the bishops who took part in today’s historic consecration. Security at Downing Street is being reviewed after a hoax caller managed to get through to David Cameron on one of his official mobile phones. He’d claimed to be the head of the intelligence agency, GCHO. The hoaxer also managed to speak to the director of GCHO, Robert Hannigan, claiming to be a journalist. David Cameron said the call did not ""breach security"". Here’s our political correspondent, Ross Hawkins. Move to one side, please, out of the way. It is not easy to grab a quick word with the Prime Minister. He is a well protected man who should be hard to reach. So how did a member of the public on his own reported account, drunk and on drugs, get past the security and get to chat to the Prime Minister withjust a phone and a lot of cheek? First, he reportedly said he had made complete monkeys out of the staff at surveillance Centre, is GCHQ, getting their directors number and giving him a ring, and then he got through to the Prime Minister. Walking in the country, with his daughter on his shoulders. Mike BlackBerry went in my pocket, and it claimed to be a Conference call established, which I do very frequently with the staff in my office and GCHQ, and I rapidly asked who it is, and the answer came it was a hoax call, so I pushed the red button on the BlackBerry, which ended the call. Security will be reviewed. It has happened before though do Tony Blair back in 1998. Tony? It’s William Hague. Supposedly the distinctive voice of the then Conservative Party leader. If Tony Blair was in full, 17 years later the caller is still amazed he got past the switchboard. The idea was to call as William Hague and speak to the switchboard and ask if I could speak to the Prime Minister. And for William Hague to be told that he thought the switchboard would say no, you cannot go, so the very helpful person on the switchboard said, yes, OK, we will put you through. It wasn’t meant to happen to him either, Prime Minister who needs to talk to voters but not necessarily on Sunday on his phone. One by one. Ross Hawkins. Our top story this lunchtime. Greece’s new government is warned not to go back on the agreements it’s already made on bailing out the economy. And still to come. Arise, Sir Prince Philip. The Duke of Edinburgh is given a knighthood by the Australian government. Coming up at1.30 Coming up at 1.30 in sport we catch UP Coming up at 1.30 in sport we catch up with Tom Daley in Rio who tells us he will drop the demon dive and swap it for one that nobody has ever attempted in competition, in a bid to win Olympic Gold next year. ""This could be a storm the likes of which we have never seen before."" That’s how the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, described what forecasters are warning could be the worst winter blizzard ever to hit the east of the United States. The storm is already causing widespread disruption. Nearly 1,500 flights have been cancelled, as it begins to hit a 250 mile stretch of the eastern seaboard from Newjersey to Maine. In New York City, they’re braced for as much as two feet of snow. Daniel Boettcher reports. A foretapes of what is to come, the snow has started, a blizzard is heading for the east coast of the US. This is Massachusetts, conditions already treacherous. Forecasters say it is just the beginning. And the snow will combine with high winds, up to 75mph in places, causing deep drifts. Road crews are already working hard to keep traffic moving. There will be no let up for the next 48-hours. Residents have been warned to prepare and so in supermarkets they are stocking up with essential, water, grocery, and snow shovels. We are preparing to not leave the house for a few day, should the need arise. Stocking up for the blizzard thatis arise. Stocking up for the blizzard that is about to happen. Up to 60 million people live in the area covered by a winter storm warning. New York’s mayor says the blizzard could be one of the worst the city has had to cope with We are facing most likely one of the largest snow storms in the history of this city. Projections for this storm are that it would easily be as much as two feet of snow, potentially pushing on closer to three feet of snow. It has been a mild winter so far in many North East state, in places the last few days saw the first real snow of the season, and despite the warning, some are taking it in their stride. It is new England. It is winter. You have to do what you have to do. But emergency planners are preparing for a storm front 250 miles long. Airlines have been already been cancelling flights. On one estimate 1700 could be affected. As the blizzard picks up strength today and for, residents are warned not to underestimate what lies ahead. Let’s speak to ABC’s correspondent, Rob Marciano, who’s in Boston. That isn’t snow. No, it is not. This is salt. 35,000 tonnes of it. It is being shipped in from as far away as Chile. This pure white stuff is from Mexico, and they have been uploading it and downloading it all morning long, and getting it on trucks that will be spreading it throughout the city, so salt trucks and ploughs about 750 of them here in Boston. Boss, all over, all the way down to Philly, they are prepping for the storm. It has been a quiet season so far, Simon, but that is all about the storm, about the change, and the storm coming. How are people bracing themselveses? This was pointed out. It is winter, it is not that unexpected? No, especially after last winter, it was a bear of a winter, with all sorts of records broken for cold and snow, so, people have been waiting for it to drop. Now it is coming. New Englanders are hardy folk, they are used to storms. The first one of the big season takes the The first one of the big season ta kes the system by The first one of the big season takes the system by shock, they were out in full force yesterday and this morning clearing the shelves off grocery store, you have to really think about being stuck in your home for several days, and with the winds of over 60mph, potentially here on the coastline of Boston new England, there will be power outage, you could be stuck in buzz of the snow and also be stuck with no power or heat for several day, you have to prepare for that. It could be dangerous especially for the elderly. Thank you very much. A BBC poll has revealed that the future of the NHS is the public’s key concern in the run-up to May’s General Election, with immigration and the economy also big issues. Tomorrow it will be 100 days before polling, and the campaign countdown is well and truly underway. Our correspondent Christian Fraser is here with more details. May 7 is still some distance away - perhaps some of you are holding your head at the prospect of three months of this intense political campaigning - but tomorrow, 100 days from the 2015 election, the countdown will be on. So brace yourself for three months of prophecy and policy, three months in which these men and women will be crossing the country, gripping hands, grabbing babies, honing and repeating the message, all of it to convince you they have the answers. It will be the longest campaign on record, but what are the issues? What is it we really care about most? Well, the results of our new BBC Populus poll out today - it’s a sample of 4200 people - tells us these are the top policy areas. 74% think the NHS is very important. Then comes the economy. And third is immigration. So over the next three months we are going to focus on these top issues. We will drill into the party’s manifestos. And we are going to reality check the so-called facts and figures they are giving us. Let me show you why that might be important. Earlier this month we were reporting on some of the worst figures in A&E for 10 years. Less than 93% of people attending A&E were seen within four hours. That is a fact. But then both main parties took to social media to put over their side the story. This was Labour’s spin. 1.25 million people waiting longer in 2014. This was the Health Secretary’s version. More patients than ever being seen. So who’s right? Well, in fact they are both right. Attendances are at record levels and so too are the numbers seen within four hours. But because so many people are using A&E, you can see that the numbers waiting over four hours are also at record levels. In other words, we are going to need more insight. We will bring you that through this regular reality check, twinned with the valuable insight of our resident experts, the BBC editors. And remember, if you want to see the full facts and figures in more detail, we will have lots more on the BBC’s website. There you will find the Live Politics page, as well as the Countdown Special and the Editors’ blogs. The Prime Minister says they’re making ""good progress"" on finalising who’ll take part in the television debates in the run up to the General Election. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor, Norman Smith. Really? Over the weekend it did seem the mood music was heading in a direction of the debate going ahead of, after the broadcasters decided to include, The Greens and Plaid Cymru, but then this morning the Prime Minister suddenly raised the plight of the Northern Irish parties saying he couldn’t see why they were missing out because they are part of the UK. Fuelling a suspicion among those of us of a cynical disposition maybe this was an attempt to insert a spoke into the wheel of the debates. NumberTen a spoke into the wheel of the debates. Number Ten say not so. Negotiations are continuing and the PM wants the debates to go ahead. But, if the Northern Ireland parties are included you would have a debate which involved notjust seven but potentially 11 participant, enough to have a five-a-side football match with one person to be spare for referee, but maybe that is what some want. He already has a formidable list of titles and honours, but the Duke of Edinburgh now has a new one, thanks to the Prime Minister of Australia. Tony Abbott reintroduced the honours system last year and he’s awarded the Duke a knighthood, in recognition for his service to the country. Opponents are up in arms. The Labour leader, Bill Shorten, said that when he first heard the news he thought it was a joke. jon Donnison reports. Australia Day is a day when this country celebrates all things, well, Australian. But it was a pom who was causing a few ripples this year. Prince Phillip, getting an Australian knighthood, the country’s highest honour. The monarchy has been an important part of Australia’s life since 1788. Prince Phillip has been a great servant of Australia, he has been a great servant of all the countries of the Commonwealth. Tony Abbott only row introduced Knights and Dames into the honours system last year, much to the dismay of Republicans. To give one of the first ones to the Oueen’s husband did not sit well with everyone. The Abbott Government count find an Australian to give one of those awards to. Labour doesn’t believe we should have gone back to Dames and Knight, if we are going to have the system, give it to Australian, Even those in the Prime Minister’s party were taken aback I read the wires and I thought it was April Fool’s day. It is Australia Day. A time when we get together. We celebrate all the good things about being Darwinites, terse forrian, Australian, everything that is unique about it pause a culture and people. It is 15 years since Australians voteded in a referendum against becoming a republic and chose instead to keep the Queen as head of state. Prince Phillip is no stranger to controversy here. On a visit in 2002 he famously rince Phillip is no stranger to controversy here. On a visit in 2002 he famously asked an Aboriginal leader ""Do you still throw spears at each other?"" The Greek singer, Demis Roussos, has died at the age of 68. He sold over 60 million albums and was best known in the UK for his song, ""Forever And Ever"". Here’s Robert Sillito. Ously asked an Aboriginal leader ""Do you still throw spears at each other?"" # Ever and ever?"" # Everand ever # Forever and # Everand ever # Foreverand ever... # Forever and ever. .. # Forever and ever... # The beard the kaftans that plaintive voice. In the mid 70s Demis Roussos was top of the charts. Forever and Ever. One of the songs the long hot summer of 1976. It was a big hit all over the world. Because it is a good song. The image was part of a snowball that has been created through record companies and managements. The most important thing in my head was the music. That image constructed by the record companies was nowhere to be seen with his first hit, alongside a fellow Greek musician Vangelis. When the band split they went solo and he had a series of hits in Europe. Success in Britain came with a song that voked summer, foreign holiday, sunshine. And in these years he lived, the 70 suech star life. A Greek love gad in Abigail’s Party. Angela likes ruse ruerks Tony likes him, like and Sue would like to hear him. So, please, do you think we could have Demis Roussos on? This document triat the time captured a bit of the Demis Roussos mania, but things like this don’t last. But he remains across Europe a popular and successful performer. Happy to revisit the old hiss and remember a moment in the ‘70s when love, sun s and romance was, for many, an evening with Demis Roussos. Demis Roussos who died at the age of 68. You are watching the BBC News at one. It is 129 minutes past one. Our top story today: Germany has told the new Greek Government not to go back on its commitments to raise taxes and cut spending. In a moment, Darren Bett will be here with a full national weather forecast, plus the news where you are. But first, with news from the Australian Tennis Open and all the rest of the day’s sport, here’s Katie Gornall at the BBC Sports Centre. We’ll start in Melbourne where Venus Williams has reached the quarter finals of a Grand Slam for the first time in five years. She beat the sixth seed Agnieska Radwanska at the Australian Open, and is on course to meet her sister Serena in the semi-finals. Meanwhile defending men’s champion Stan Wawrinka has set up a quarter-final match with japan’s Kei Nishikori, after coming from 5-0 down in a fourth-set tie-break to beat Spain’s Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. Top seed Novak Djokovic is also through, after beating Gilles Muller in straight sets. There was a great result for Britain’s Dom Inglot and his Romanian partner Florin Merger. They knocked out the world number one pair, Bob and Mike Bryan in straight sets, to reach the quarter-finals of the men’s doubles. Inglot and Merger only started playing together in the autumn. He did a greatjob of settling me down at some points and said, be solid, we don’t have to do too much. We came out with a really good return today and we kept the game plan tight on the service. I think it paid dividends. Gary Street has left his role as head coach of the England WOITIEFIIS I’Ugi3y tâ8ITI. Street has held the position since 2007 and led the side to their first World Cup title in 20 years last year. The RFU said the decision was made by mutual consent. Tom Daley says he can win Olympic gold next year after replacing his so called ""demon dive"" with a new routine. Daley developed a phobia of the dive last year and needed therapy to deal with the problem. He’s been speaking exclusively to the BBC’s Nick Hope at a recent training camp in Rio. Rio goals traditionally comes in the form of sand but that will change when the Olympics visit South America that for the first time and Tom Daley is in a bid to better the bronze he claimed in London. You spend so much of your life building towards London 2012, and now it is all about Rio. All I thought about was London 2012, but as soon as it was over, Rio 2016 has come around so fast, and every time I get to train in the swimming pool, it makes mY train in the swimming pool, it makes my heart beat faster. It is crazy, you stand there, and you think, the stands will be packed. This is where the four years have hard work have led up to and for me to visualise that, it has helped a lot. Tom Daley is used of overcoming adversity having dealt with the pressure that came with his rise to fame at a young age and coping with the loss of his father when he was just 17. Last year he became one of only a handful of active sportsman currently competing to reveal that he is gay. The support and reception was amazing. It made me feel so comfortable and it made me feel happy to be who I wanted to be and it makes it so much easier to train. If you are happy when you are training, you will compete better. A key area further push is a new routine. The self-proclaimed Beaman dive which a medal is gone. It has been replaced by what he is dubbing the Firework, but he won’t show it. No one has done it on the ten metres before, and it’s one of the riskiest decisions I have made, and to be able to do the diet has taken so much weight on my shoulder, and I think the dives are now strong enough to get me a gold medal-- Demon dive. The diet will be debuted at the National Championships in Plymouth next month, his next major start on the road to Rio goal. -- Plymouth next month, his next major start on the road to Rio goal. -- do the dive. We can speak now to the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Reverend Paul Bayes. It has been a long journey, but we have a woman in the College of Bishops, and I have been sticking up this the decades, it feels like a marvellous milestone on the journey. I am guessing that you hope it is the first of many. We hope the first of many, and every time there is an interview for a bishop, we will be able to open the field to all of those women and men who would be right for thejob. We hope we will appoint the right person but there are lots of women in the church you have been waiting for the opportunity to serve the church at this level. Libby Lane is the first and we hope there are lots to follow. Is there hope that this will attract more people to church, or is it more symbolic than that? In the church we want to share the gospel of good news with everybody. As people look at the church, they want to see a church that puts the good news into practice. We believe that God loves women and men equally, so now, after a long time of listening to minorities in the church to try and get organised, we have got to this point, the bells are ringing and we are rejoicing today. The Bishop of Liverpool, thank you for joining us. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Darren Bett. 70 centimetres possible in the US, we are talking snow, but that is not heading our way, but in the week that rain -- heading our way, but in the week that rain -- weather will change, an icy blast, bitterly cold in wind and there will be snow showers around, ten centimetres possibly over the hills in the north, but a big change. The weather is fairly quiet and benign at the moment. This is the cloud coming in off the Atlantic tomorrow. This is the cloud leaving us, and in between we have a window of something drier, brighter, and sunshine, albeit hazy. Some showers across northern parts of the UK. For England and Wales, fine and dry for England and Wales, but milky skies, quite white, but temperatures getting up to seven or 8 degrees. Any showers in the north-west of England will fade away quickly, and by late afternoon, not many showers left for Northern Ireland. Most of the showers will be in the North of Scotland, and this is where we have the stronger wind and the showers will fall as sleet and snow, mainly over the hills. will fall as sleet and snow, mainly overthe hills. By over the hills. By the evening temperatures will for sharply, but overnight temperatures will for sharply, but overnight as the wind changes to west or south westerly, we dragged cloud from the Atlantic and pick up rain across Scotland and the many temperatures will rise as the night goes on but where we have clearer skies, this is where it will be coldest in the south-east, and a touch of Frost. This is where we could see sunshine, and it will brighten up through the day across eastern areas, but further west, more clout, not much rain, bits of pieces and mainly drizzle over the western hills as the south westerly breeze oppressions, the temperatures lived up to 9 degrees. -- breeze oppressions, the temperatures lived up to 9 degrees. -- more cloud. But things will change around the middle part of the week and it is this first weather system that will bring the change. That is bringing with it outbreaks of rain, pushing across the whole of the country on Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, so the last of the mild air will not last long and then we draw down the wins from Greenland, then the Arctic which will drag in much colder air and bring with it snow showers. Increasingly across the North, and almost anywhere could seek sleet and snow, and into Thursday the wins will pick up, so gale force winds are quite likely. -- will pick up, so gale force winds are quite likely. -- the wins will pick up. Colder than the temperatures suggest, a good few degrees below freezing. Getting very much colder, more wintry showers from the mid week and that is likely to lead to travel disruption. At the moment, mostly across the north of the UK, but we could even get snow across the South. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: In the last few minutes, the leader of the anti-austerity Syriza party in Greece has been sworn in as the country’s new Prime Minister. And the Church of England has consecrated its first female bishop. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. ",,

Plans for this new women’sjail in Inverclyde are scrapped, the government say they are changing their approach to female criminals. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at 6. Europe is facing an uncertain future tonight after Greece voted in the anti-austerity party, Syriza. Their leader Alexis Sip-ras has promised to stand up to Brussels and renegotiate the terms of Greece’s massive international bailout. The Greeks have suffered years of austerity - with more than a quarter of its population now out of work. But tonight the Greeks are being told to ‘stick by the rules of the game’. Our Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt is in Athens. Alexis Tsipras, a former communist, arrived at the presidential residency in Athens today to be sworn in as the Greek Prime Minister. The lIo-year-old leader of the radical left party Syriza signed alongside the president, taking office promising to renegotiate the country ‘s bailout, prompting new warnings that the Greek place in the Eurozone could be at risk. He broke with tradition, refusing the blessing of an Orthodox priest. There has been an urgency in forming this government, the bailout extension will soon expire, and the financial markets and the Eurozone do not want a long period of uncertainty. On the streets everyone understood that the country had taken a dramatic turn, voting for an anti-austerity party. Many were optimistic. TRANSLATION: It is a change for something new. I really hope he is up to it. It is the best card we had to vote for. And we did, I think. We did well. Alexis Tsipras needed partners to give him an overall majority. Today unexpectedly he formed a coalition with the fiercely anti-immigrant party of Independent Greeks. All of the Greeks will be together in Europe. They have voted for a government they hope will end past posterity. They have been in economic crisis for six years. Since 2010 it has received 100 4017 -- for six years. Since 2010 it has received 100 4017 --170 £9 billion as part of a bailout. Now it wants to renegotiate the terms of the bailout. As Alexis Tsipras prepares to try to get a better deal for Greece, there were lots of warnings today from European officials that Greece had to abide by commitments already made. The new Greek government will not receive a worse off but also not a better offer. Meaning that we accept the decision of the Greek people and we expect the government to accept our conditions. The new government in Athens insisted that they could win major concessions while still staying in the Eurozone. We will stay in the Eurozone and work within the traditional framework of Europe, there is no question about it. Storms blew over the Greek capital tonight, and all of the signs are that there will be difficult negotiations ahead. There was a stark message, other European leaders are ready to talk but Greece must stick to prior agreements. With me now is our Economics Editor - Robert Peston. The Greeks have had enough of austerity - but how serious could this prove to be for the Eurozone - and the rest of Europe? Well, it is a very big moment. It is true that we have just had representatives of the Greek government saying Greece will not leave the Eurozone but they have to say that because the moment they hinted they would leave, anyone with assets or money in Greece took it out and that would be devastating. They are hoping for a negotiation to lessen the austerities. But at the moment there is a lot of brinkmanship going on. There is strong signals from most of the Eurozone, and most importantly from Germany, they are calling the shots, they are in no frame of mind to compromise in a serious way. Interestingly investors are currently hoping for the best, it has been a calm day on the markets. Partly that is because they somehow think that a deal will be done and partly because the European Central Bank last week said it would pump an enormous amount of money into the Eurozone and that is breeding confidence at the moment. These negotiations will be fraught, and if they fail, and Greece were to leave the Eurozone, well, we would not BC in a calm day for the markets. -- the Eurozone, well, we would not BC in a calm day for the markets. -- we would not see a calm day on the markets. The implications for Greece would be serious. After almost 500 years - the Church of England has its first woman Bishop. The Reverend Libby Lane was consecrated at York Minister. The service was led by the Archbishop of York, and attended by more than 1,000 worshippers. Danny Savage sent this report. Clergy came to York from all over the world today to witness history being made. joining them were parishioners from Libby Lane’s church in Cheshire, thrilled that their vicar was being made a bishop. Absolutely fantastic. We’re so proud of her. It’s a wonderful day for us all, yes, and for women. It’s about time. So I’m proud of that. But Libby’sjust Libby to us. Libby Lane at first took her place alongside her husband, who’s also a priest. She wasn’t giving interviews today. But he was. Libby’s quite clear this isn’t about her. This is about the Church and above all it’s aboutjesus Christ and Christ being glorified in a church that is complete in all its ministries. Forgive us our sins... This was a most traditional service for the Church of England’s most modern move. I, Elizabeth jane Holden Lane, Clerk of Holy Orders, chosen Bishop of the Church and See of Stockport. The decision to appoint women bishops follows decades of debates, objections and votes. One past objector is Martin Dales, though even he was here today to witness change at the top. I’m very glad to be here because I think it’s important we are as one. That’s what we’re meant to be and we may not all agree on everything all the time. Who does? We at least have made big strides to try and at least start the journey. But during the service, there was a dramatic interruption. When the Archbishop of York asked the congregation if Libby Lane should be ordained, there was one dissenting voice. No! Not in the Bible. With respect, Your Grace, I ask to speak on this absolute impediment. The sentiment was dismissed by the Archbishop, and afterwards another bishop told me what he thought. The guy took his opportunity. The Archbishop of York replied by saying, ""Legally we’ve gone through all the processes, we’ve prayed about it, our hearts are in the right place. What do you think?"" And the whole congregation, maybe with one exception, all shouted, ""We’re ready for this"". Our Lord, we pray... The interruption didn’t affect the outcome. Libby Lane was consecrated as planned and welcomed as the new Bishop of Stockport, an honour she’s described as unexpected and very exciting. A warm response awaited her outside the Minster, too. There may soon be other female bishops but Libby Lane will always be remembered as the first. Danny Savage, BBC News. The disgraced former cyclist Lance Armstrong has admitted that if he could turn back time he’d ""probably"" cheat again. In 2012, the American was stripped of his 7 Tour de France titles after being found guilty of doping. But now Armstrong says he wants his life ban lifted. He’s been speaking exclusively to our Sports Editor Dan Roan. This is Armstrong country. It’s here in Texas that the world’s most infamous sportsman has hidden away for the last two years. These days there are few signs of the man who used to be Austin’s favourite son, but now, in the bike shop he still owns here, Lance Armstrong gave me a rare insight into how his life changed after he confessed to being a drugs cheat. The fallout has been, erm, heavy. I mean, maybe heavier than even I thought. It was pretty brutal afterwards. So it’s... It’s been tough, it’s been trying. Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times in a row, all the more extraordinary having overcome cancer. But after years of denying doping allegations, he was found to have cheated. The UCI would strip him of his seven Tour de France titles. Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling. His confession to Oprah Winfrey sealed his downfall but now he feels the time for forgiveness is near. I’m not going to lie to you. Selfishly I would say... Yeah, we’re getting close to that time. I deserved some punishment. Has it gone too far? Of course I’m going to say yes. Armstrong’s been disowned by the cancer charity he founded, deserted by sponsors and has lost millions fighting legal battles but he insists he’s been made a scapegoat for an era when doping was commonplace. We’ve got to look at the whole. .. Don’t we got to look at the whole play? You were the ringleader. It wasn’t just the doping, it was the bullying, the intimidation, the lying in depositions, the betraying of your friends. And some of that’s true, some of that’s not true. There was certainly a dishonesty there that I think is totally regrettable and inexcusa ble. Two years after he confessed to doping, here in Austin Lance Armstrong is now taking his first tentative steps towards what he hopes will be a public rehabilitation. What many Americans want to see is evidence of genuine remorse but when it comes to his use of performance-enhancing drugs, some may be disappointed. If I was racing in 2015, no, I wouldn’t do it again. Because I don’t think you have to do it again. If you take me back to 1995, when it was... completely and totally pervasive... I’d probably do it again. People don’t like to hear that. Armstrong hopes his ban will be reduced after co-operating with World Cycling’s investigation into the sport’s trouble past, due to report next month. I was totally honest, I was totally transparent. At this point in my life I’m not out to protect anybody. These days Armstrong trains alone and hasn’t ridden a bike in months. The fate of a man used to being in control now rests with others. The road to redemption could be a long one. Within the last few minutes we have received reports of a plane crash in Spain, a Greek fighterjet crashed during Nato exercise this afternoon. It lost power shortly after take off and flew into an area where a number of other planes were parked. SSE has announced it’s cutting gas prices by 4.1 percent- making it the fifth of the so-called ""big six"" energy firms to lower its tariffs. However SSE’s price reduction - which follows big falls in wholesale costs - won’t take effect until the end of April. Kurdish forces in Syria have reportedly regained control of the town of Kobane - on the Turkish border- from Islamic State militants - after nearly four months of intense street fighting. However, the Pentagon says it might be too early to declare the town won, even though Kurdish forces are largely in control. Campaigners opposed to fracking have been staging a rally at Westminster - where MPs are debating the issue of shale gas exploration. It comes as a group of MPs has called for the controversial method of extracting shale gas to be suspended saying it could harm the environment. In the last few minutes the Commons has voted against the bid to suspend fracking. Our Science Editor, David Shukman, reports. The mass machinery of a fracking operation in Texas, blasting into the shale rock. Technology that unlocked a lot of home Ronan gas and oil. The British government wants it to happen here.-- oil. The British government wants it to happen here. -- home-grown. The fields of Lancashire are the first to tap this new source of energy but there is opposition and MPs on a leading select committee want everything stopped because they are worried about the risks. Our committee felt as though this had not been thought through, we are rushing ahead with a new green rights for fracking without these basic issue is not having been thought through, so we have two putted on hold and see how to proceed. -- putted on hold and see how to proceed. -- we have to put it on hold. At Westminster this afternoon, a demonstration against the bill which would make fracking easier. There is nothing new here, but environmental groups are keeping UP but environmental groups are keeping up the pressure and they have celebrity support. The lorries that would need to come here everyday. They would be mad. The people are so ignorant who believe in it. Review here and from the MPs is that because Shell gas is a fossil fuel, then for the sake of the climate it must be left in the ground. But supporters say we’re going to need gas for decades to come and that surely it is better to use our own. -- come and that surely it is better to use our own. -- the view here and from MPs is that because shale gas is a fossil fuel. Gas is seen as a cleaner alternative and renewable energy like wind has the problem of being intermittent, so some major industrial figures believe British shale gas is the answer. For the next hundred years we need gas, so why bring it across the world from areas which might let us down and with the cost and the additional CO2 involved in from sport. Let’s use our own. Are you sure you can do it safely? Absolutely. We have the experience from the US to ensure we can do it safely and we have to reassure local communities that is the case. That is the easy -- reassure local communities that is the case. That is the easy -- easier in the wide-open spaces of America, but where fracking happens comes down to a balance between economic benefit and environmental impact, and a lot depends local opinion. Our top story this evening: The new prime minister Alexis Sipras is sworn in, promising to renegotiate the terms of his country’s massive EU bailout. And still to come, Downing Street reviews security after a hoax mobile phone was put through to David Cameron’s mobile phone. Later on BBC London: We speak to one of the survivors of Auschwitz as the 70th anniversary of liberation is commemorated at City Hall. And, preserving historic sounds from the past century. The campaign to save a national archive at the British Library. It looks set to be one of the most unpredictable general elections in living memory. And with 100 days of campaigning left between now and May, the parties and their leaders are all gearing up to try to win our votes on May 7th. But which issues do voters care about most? And what could swing the outcome? Our correspondentjon Kay has been gauging the pre-election mood in Gloucester. So which we heading? The UK is that a crossroads. And we are all about to get a say. We have come to the centre of Gloucester with 100 days of campaigning ahead, and we are here to ask people, what are the issues they will be voting on? And who do they think will win? Who is going to win? Don’t know! I don’t know. I’ve no idea! Icon believe anybody is going to come out on top. You think it will be a coalition against? Yes. I’m very excited. Are you? Why? It is an opportunity for the country to go in a slightly different direction. I’ve never voted in my life. Are you going to vote this time? I’m going to vote this time. We came up with this top ten. At number three, this time. We came up with this top ten. At numberthree, 60% ten. At number three, 60% said immigration. There’s got to be a stop somewhere with immigration, hasn’t there? We can’t keep taking people in because we can’t cope. We have this problem with shortage of housing and is it because of the immigrants that are coming in from Eastern Europe? They’ve got to live somewhere. They can’t live on the street. I’mjust somewhere. They can’t live on the street. I’m just worried because if I can’t get a job because there are so many people here. The second biggest issue was the UK economy. 69% said it will be very important. just getting back onto firmer footing so it’s not something you have to worry about, job security. Uncommon up to 76 and I’m still working just to keep our heads above, you know. -- working just to keep our heads above, you know. -- Iam coming up to 76. But the number one election issue in our poll, the NHS, said 74%. It is very important. It is part of our heritage and culture and our pride. It is unique so it needs to be looked after. I don’t like it. I would rather look after my own health, if I’m honest. And not have an NHS? Go private. Who will win the election? I’ve no idea! He’s got 100 days to think about it. There’s more information on the general election on our website. And if you want to see how the political parties are faring in terms of public opinion, you can see go to bbc.co.uk/polltracker. The Prime Minister has said no harm was done when a hoax call was put through to his mobile phone but security measures should be reviewed. The caller claimed to be the head of the listening agency GCHO. Officials say the Prime Minister ended the call within a matter of seconds. Our political correspondent Ross Hawkins has more. Getting the ear of the Prime Minister is never easy. Aids, secretaries and switchboards all help to decide whose calls he takes. So how did a member of the public on his own reported account-- reported account drunk and on drugs get past all that security and get to chat to the Prime Minister withjust a phone and a lot of cheap? First he reportedly said he had mate complete monkeys out of the staff here at GCHO, monkeys out of the staff here at GCHQ, getting their director’s number and GCHQ, getting their director’s numberand giving him GCHQ, getting their director’s number and giving him a numberand giving him a ring. Then he got through to the Prime Minister. My BlackBerry went in my pocket, I answered Minister. My BlackBerry went in my pocket, Ianswered it pocket, I answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established, which I do obviously very frequently between the head of GCHQ which I do obviously very frequently between the head of GCHO and some of the staff in my office, so I quite rapidly asked, who is this? To which the answer came, it is a hoax call. And so I pushed the Red Button on the BlackBerry which ended the call. Security will be reviewed. It has happened before, though, to Tony Blair back in 1998. Hello? Tony? Yes. It is William Hague. Supposedly, the distinctive voice of the then Conservative Party leader. It is quite a good imitation. I am trying to work out who it is. Blair wasn’t fooled, and 17 years later, the caller is amazed he got past the switchboard. The idea was to call as William Hague and say, ""Could I speak to the Prime Minister?"" and for William Hague to be told, ""No, you can’t, go away!"" But they put me through! It was, hang on, that wasn’t supposed to happen! It wasn’t meant to happen to him either. A Prime Minister who needs to talk to voters but not necessarily on a Sunday, on his phone, one by one. The East Coast of America is bracing itself for what could be its biggest ever snow storm. Up to three feet of snow is forecast over the next few hours from Pennsylvania to Maine. Thousands of flights have been cancelled and New York’s mayor has told residents to ""prepare for the worst"". Our correspondent Nick Bryant is in New York. their toughness and resilience but the city is about to face an epic test. These flurries were a small prelude of the white out expected later on. The forecast has been for blizzards, dumping three feet of snow. Good morning, America. The National Weather Service already calling this a crippling and potentially stalling blizzard. This isjust potentially stalling blizzard. This is just the beginning. potentially stalling blizzard. This isjust the beginning. With is just the beginning. With 50 million people living in the path of the storm, officials across the north-east are mounting a massive operation. In New York alone, 2000 snowploughs are ready to hit the streets. They can clear 6000 miles of road. It is going to be a storm of immense scale. We are facing most likely one of the largest snowstorms in the history of this city, the recorded history of this city. Small wonder, then, that supermarkets have seen long lines and hardware stores are selling out of salt and shovels. People are also preparing for a potential loss of power. I am concerned. That is why I am here! It is extraordinary to think that one of the world’s most advanced cities could be paralysed by a snowstorm. But that is what is happening. Even shutting down the subway system before the evening rush hour, in addition to the main highways. Will this storm beat bigger than previous ones? The Greek singer Demis Roussos has died at the age of 68. He became a household name in the 1970s with his flowing locks and a trademark kaftan. He sold 60 million albums worldwide. David Sillito looks back at his life. # For everand # For ever and ever, # FOI’ EVEF and EVEI’, EVEF and EVEF # FOI’ Ever and EVEI’, Ever and Ever # For everand ever, everand ever # You will be... #.

One of his most famous terms was in the band Aphrodite ‘s Child. His first British solo hit, a song that evoked summer, foreign holidays and sunshine. His image, his allure, a Greek love God who lived the 70s superstar lifestyle. And in Mike Leigh’s Abigail ‘s Party, Demis loomed large. I like Demis Roussos and we would like to hear Demis Roussos. The peak soon faded but he continued to perform across Europe. His compatriot said today he had a superb voice. He was an artist, a friend. He was a singer whose music evokes a moment in the 70s when love, Sun and romance was, for many, and evening with Demis Roussos. Demis Roussos, who has died at the age of 68. Time now for a look at the weather. It has started snowing already in New York and Philadelphia but nothing like that over here? Nothing like that here. But we will cease in strong winds, so if you are stepping out it will feel bitter. The snow in the forecast is in the form of showers but we will need to keep an eye on the detail in the next couple of days. Through the night tonight we see rain showers developing in the north-west with patchy rain through the end of the night -- by patchy rain through the end of the night-- by the end of the night, with clearer skies in the South and East, so cold here. Temperatures in OUT our major towns and cities down to 2 degrees or three degrees, sojust above freezing. Much more clout in the North and West. We have that breeze dragging in with overcast skies over Northern Ireland. Not a huge amount of rain but a cloudy affair in the East of Scotland. We have brightness to the south-east corner. Still some occasional bright spells and temperatures throughout the afternoon with all of that cloud not doing too badly. We have a south-westerly breeze with patchy rain in western areas and highs of 7-9. It is Wednesday when we will see quite a significant change in our weather. We have a couple of weather fronts moving down from the north-west and that is where we will see the lower temperatures. The colder conditions developing through the day on Wednesday and we have our first weather prompt bringing outbreaks of rain across England and Wales slowly clearing eastwards. -- weather front. The snow showers will be gathering, even to lower levels, and we then have a strong north-westerly breeze with temperatures in the north struggling at 4 degrees or 5 degrees. Still not doing too badly in the south but the cold arrives there by the end of the week. And we need to keep an eye on the forecast for the potential of some disruption.

He said the background checks are carried out by number other company, that of a client wants a refund they will get it in four to six weeks. We approach the trainer for his response is that the training was not up to standard, and received no response. We are horrified that people with very little money already are now put into a really difficult position. The allegations are very serious. I hope that they get investigated by the police. But the former Health Secretary says the law needs changing, as agencies aren’t regulated by any health body at all. Sadly, they are splitting a loophole in the law. They are doing it because they can do it. It is about time that Parliament got its act together. The government says an new set of standards will tighten up regulation. But we found that they won’t apply to care agencies. What has happened to be is women could happen tojob seekers has happened to be is women could happen to job seekers again and again. And you can see more on that story on Inside Out London, later tonight at 7.30pm here on BBC1. Coming up later in the programme: Remembering the Holocaust. It was too horrible for words. We speak to one of the survivors of Auschwitz, as City Hall holds a special ceremony commemorating the Holocaust. Three people have been arrested after shots were fired into two properties in North West London. Police were called to reports of a man with a gun on Gloucester Close in Stonebridge just before 1pm this afternoon. We can get more details from our reporter Nick Beake, who is in Cricklewood tonight. What do we know happened? The police say they were first alerted because a man was seen with a shotgun moving in and out of a property. Firearms officers were scrambled, and also the police helicopter was sent up. But before the specialist marksman could arrive at the scene at Stonebridge Park, it seems the suspect fired shots into macro different residential properties. In terms of what happened then, that is by no means clear. The police haven’t given further information on that. We know that a Vauxhall Corsa was stopped and a woman was arrested. But it seems the focus of the operation then shifted to this area, to Cricklewood. We can see some photographs that were taken by member of the public. They showed what was unfolding here, the drama of firearms officers taking up position in the street here. Some areas were sealed off. One eyewitness told me what he saw. There was a lot of police activity. Six or seven police cars raced past me of hours parking my car. I got out the card went to see what was happening. I came into this road, and saw about 15 or 20 armed police officers assembling and preparing door battering ram type devices and automatic weapons. It seems that the police came here and their attention shifted here because of that Vauxhall Corsa car that. It. shifted here because of that Vauxhall Corsa carthat. It. It Vauxhall Corsa car that. It. It was traced to this property. The short time later, eyewitnesses describe people being brought out from the property behind me. There were said to be two people who were brought out, handcuffs. They are now in custody. In all we know that four people have been arrested, three men have been detained on firearms offences, and a woman as well. She is being kept in police custody. The police are stressing that no one was injured in both of these incidents. They are also stressing that no firearms officers deployed their weapons. Police are appealing for help to trace a man after a blind woman was sexually assaulted on the tube at Waterloo. Detectives say he offered help to the woman leave the carriage, but instead sexually assaulted her. The incident took place on a southbound Northern Line train on the morning of Wednesday the 3rd of December while travelling with her guide dog. Thameslink and Southeastern Trains are once again disrupted because of flooding in a tunnel on Friday. These pictures show a train having to go through rising water at Farringdon Station after a water main burst. The leak has now been repaired, but there’s still a reduced service while thousands of litres of water is cleared from the line. The first team of paramedics from Down Under have started work for the London Ambulance Service. They’ve travelled 10,000 miles to be here, to help cover a recruitment crisis in the capital. After being put through a conversion course, the recruits are now ready to go out and help Londoners. As Sarah Harris reports. Riding to the rescue of the London Ambulance Service from the other side of the world. This group of paramedics pinning their shifts are raw from Australia and New Zealand. Why did they want to start work in Chile and busy London? Travel is the big one for me. It’s great being up this side of the world. It costs a lot to come over here. So to be so close to Europe on my days off is brilliant. Being a graduate, you have gone to university for three years, and you want to use those skills and be as busy as you possibly can. So I thought, what better place to start my career than London? So here I am. Hundreds 75 Antipodean ‘s have been recruited. Simone is one of them, she graduated in 2013 and this will be her first job. She is happy to help London out. Of course. But you are also giving me an opportunity for a job as a paramedic, and to develop myself as a paramedic. I would have to say thank you to London. This is what many of the recruits are missing back home on Australia Day, the national holiday, ironically to mark the first British ships arriving to start a new life down under in 1788. Now, they are needed here to help staff shortages in a growing and under pressure service. I can’t get enough paramedics quickly enough from the universities here, so we are recruiting overseas. The quality of candidates, specifically from Australia and New Zealand, is really good. The education and training is pretty similar to hear. education and training is pretty similarto hear. So, managers appeared to hit on the solution 10,000 miles away. There will be another recruitment drive in Sydney in the spring, where it is hoped 300 Aussies will be flown in to start work as London paramedics. And tomorrow we’ll be speaking to those working on the frontline of London’s Ambulance Service as part of our week-long series ""Frontline NHS"". Every day we’re hearing from the capital’s healthcare professionals working in different parts of the service. Today in the first of our reports, our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer speaks to those working to keep Londoners out of hospital. At the moment, she says she has fallen off, we haven’t got any more information. London ambulance has had its easiest week ever. They are not alone in seeing demand go through the roof. Even the service is meant to keep people away from hospitals are seeing record numbers of people calling. This NHS 111 call centre in west London is a difficult example. That’s recruited because example. It was a busier. It was super busy. In the hour that we filmed here, they took more than 100 calls. In the weekends, they take up to 1800. 111 has calls. In the weekends, they take up to1800. 111 has been to 1800. 111 has been criticised by some for sending people to wear these who don’t need to go. Usually impose myjob is to make sure that doesn’t happen that a Eugene’s job is to not send people to A&E. People don’t know what to do sometimes. When they are panicking and under stress, they don’t know what to do. Of course, this is the place where most of us meet the NHS, GP’s account for about 90% of all visits. But pressure is growing here as well. At this practice in east London, they use this system with videos posting online to help patients treat themselves. They are open from ATM to 8pm everyday, even when you wouldn’t expect it. Our Christmas Day and Boxing Day clinics were filled with routine appointments about a week in advance. I have never seen that in mY advance. I have never seen that in my whole career. Like elsewhere, getting planned appointments can take time. Up to two weeks. Is often the one to break that news. They expect to see a GP within 24 hours. At the moment, this is not possible. Appointments are about two weeks away in this practice. You need to give him one spoonful of this medicine. When things get tight, this is where Lucy sends patients. Next door, to the pharmacy. Here as well, they are open every day of the year. The main thing is that as soon as patients are getting a little bit of a symptom, just something small, they need to come into the pharmacy and seeks advice. We can dip it in the bud and from getting worse. 111, the pharmacies and local doctors are being pushed as the answer to keeping patients out of hospital. But the staff in these services are also being pushed. Demand has never been greater, and it continues to go. been greater, and it continues to 9ÂÂ "" -- Grove. And Karljoins me now. Karl, what did you want to find out when embarking on this series? We’re trying to track the patient journey in the NHS. Tomorrow we are going to be with you London Ambulance Service, the guys and girls who take you to hospital. Later on in the week we spent time in A&E. The final stage of the journey, those who try and get you out of hospital. And really, over the winter, we have seen that if anyone of those different elements of that track. , the NHS has real problems dealing with it. We are trying to track thatjourney through, but through the eyes of those who are actually trying to help patients. Are you finding common themes? There are common themes. They are running flat out just to keep up, but they are coping. They are trying to work much more closely together. There is a realisation that there is going to be a lot of money coming. We are hearing from those on the front line, we also know that there is 100 days to go until a certain event on the 7th of May. We are hearing from the people delivering the service, expecting to hear more from the people you pay for the servers, the politicians. And we can also hear from viewers on our Facebook page as well. Coming up later in the programme: How moving to London is helping Olympian Tom Daley as he prepares for Rio 2016. And, the voice of Florence Nightingale. How the National archive at the British Library is preserving historic sounds from our past. Tomorrow the world will remember the victims of the largest Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz- Berkenau, on the 70th anniversary of its liberation. Today, as part of the commemoration, survivors joined special guests at City Hall to remember the Holocaust and subsequent genocides. Alice Bhandhukravi was there. ~ I was holding onto my mother. I wouldn’t let go. Frieda was 16 when the war broke out in France. As Frenchjews, she and herfamily the war broke out in France. As Frenchjews, she and her family were eventually to Auschwitz. We were there for three days and three nights without food or water. We already work in a bad way. When they arrived, they were greeted by the man nicknamed the angel of death. The SS officer who selected who would live and who would die. He was a notorious doctor. He looked a very smart officer with shiny boots. With a smile, because everything should go orderly. People were going straight to the gas chambers, if he decided who would go to the left or to the right. If you would live or if you would die. Frieda’s parents and brother were among the 6 million who perished. But she and two other brothers were eventually freed. Now, aged 92, she still regularly speaks to schoolchildren about her experience. Today at City Hall, she joined other survivors and special guests, including the Chief Rabbi, to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive. Connections. Connections can save lives. And sometimes, life can be lost, despite connections. It is so important for us today to ensure that people keep the memory of the Holocaust alive through establishing wonderful connections with other people. People within our faith groups and beyond that. The very best way to tackle racism and xenophobia and anti-Semitism is through acts of loving-kindness and compassion. People from all faiths will become ring hob cost Memorial Day tomorrow -- will become ring hob cost Memorial Day tomorrow -- commemorating Holocaust Memorial Day tomorrow. For some, the memory never leaves. It must never be forgotten. It must be spoken about. Looking ahead to the Rio Olympics next year, and diver Tom Daley says his move to the capital will play a vital role in his bid to win gold at the Games. The 20-year-old, who took bronze at London 2012, has also revealed that he’s invented a new dive he’s calling the ""firework"" which he’s been testing out at the Olympic diving venue in Rio. Nick Hope sent this report from Brazil. Rio Gold traditionally comes in the form of sand. But that will change injust over 18 months when form of sand. But that will change in just over 18 months when the Olympics visit South America for the first time. Tom Daley is here early. You spend so much of your life building towards London 2012, it is so far in the past now, it is all about Rio? Everything that I always thought about was London 2012. As soon that was over, Rio 2016 has come around so fast. Every time I go and train the pool, it makes my heart beat so fast. He is used to overcoming adversity, with his rise to fame at such a young age and coping with the loss of his father when he wasjust and coping with the loss of his father when he was just 17. father when he wasjust 17. Last year, he became one ofjust over a handful of sports people to reveal that he is gay. The reception was just amazing. It made me feel so comfortable. It made me feel happy to be who I wanted to be, and it makes it so much easier to train, because if you are happy when you are training, then you are going to dive better and can be better. That is something he believes has boosted further from his move from Plymouth to London. To be able to train in the Olympic venue every day is amazing. You get a buzz every time you going, it never gets old. They have devised a new routine called the firework. He isn’t showing it to the publicjust yet, but it replaces the Demon dive from London 2012. No one has done this dive on telly. It is a big step. For me, being able to do that dive now has taken so much pressure off my shoulders but I think my guides are now across-the-board strong enough to try and get me a gold medal in the Olympic Games. It will be on show at the diving World Series event in London in May. His next step in the world to Rio Gold. And good luck for the gold. Imagine if we lost the sound of the past. Well, the national archive at the British Library, which has over six million recordings dating back to the 19th century, is deteriorating. If they’re not preserved by bringing the archive into the digital age, many historical moments captured on tape could be lost forever. And, as Gareth Furby explains, it’s not an easy task. We are exploring a basement deep underneath the British Library. Stacked on shelves are millions of recordings of what Britain used to sound like. Of course, to make sense of all this, you need an expert. Meet the British Library’s will Prentice, who has his favourites. james joyce’s Prentice, who has his favourites. jamesjoyce’s voice in 1924. joyce himself signed it. And he dated it. I have been transported into a country far away from London. This is the original cylinder, we believe, from 1890, containing the voice of Florence Nightingale. It is notjust that it voice of Florence Nightingale. It is not just that it can notjust that it can be hard to understand after all these years. Some of the recordings will soon be unplayable. Here is a wax cylinder from over 100 years ago. You can see it has been attached by mould. You can see this little chip in the servers. That will eventually peel away and the whole disc will pale work and become unplayable. This is the solution. Transferring everything to a digital format before it is too late. But at current staffing levels, it will take the library 48 years to do this. And the equipment needed to transfer all the different formats may not last that long. The problem is that the equipment is no longer made, and the spare parts are running out. In effect, it is a race against time. The library believes it has got no more than 15 years, so it is launching an appeal. We need to increase the amount of people working at the library, and we need more money to that. They also want to identify any other threatened collections, and hope to keep most of the recorded sounds of Britain in a state that future generations can enjoy. Gosh, 48 years! Time for a check on the weather with Georgina Burnett. How’s this week looking? It is an interesting week ahead of us. We start off on a fairly mild made over the next couple of days. It is going to be calling down quite significantly for the net half of the week. There is even a risk of snow. We have got clear skies and light winds. The temperatures look like they will stay above freezing, with lows of one to three Celsius. There may be at the old rural spot which gets below that. We could have a touch of frost for this morning. But most of us don’t have to content with that. We have a bright day ahead, a fairamount with that. We have a bright day ahead, a fair amount of sunny spells. There will be more cloud building in the afternoon from the West. Temperatures reaching a healthy eight or nine Celsius. A mild night follows as well with some outbreaks of light rain. That spells into Wednesday morning. A mild start of the afternoon as the cold air is introduced. Any cold showers on Wednesday night could fall as snow showers. They could be problematic. There is a potential for Thursday as well. In between no snow showers there are some sunny spells. Pretty strong winds as well. Temperature wise, if we look at Wednesday and Thursday we can see quite a change. We reach that high on Wednesday in the morning, it will be halved in the afternoon. Friday is slightly milder, we have more sleet and snow, but slow again over the weekend. -- snow over the weekend. Thank you, Georgina.

Turn around to numberfour if number four if you wouldn’t mind and it’s Hoy. In1966, Sir Chris Bonington was the first man to conquer one of the most dangerous climbs in Britain, the Old Man Of Hoy. At 80, he’s decided he’d quite like toe give it another go. The remagistrates court far north of Scotland is home to one of the world’s most spectacular climbing opportunities and the sight of one of the first, most audacious examples of reality television filmed in the UK. In 1967, the BBC came here to the wild remote Orkney aisles to undertake one of the most ambitious outside broadcasts ever. The world’s best rock climbers attempted to scale Britain’s most famous piece of rock. The Old Man Of Hoy. 50 million people watched as climbers gave arm chair adrenaline junkries insight into the most dangerous scaling of 450 feet of fragile exposed rock, sticking precariously out of the North Sea. That was something that crumbled under my feet. A young climber called Chris Bonington was the first man ever to called Chris Bonington was the first man everto climb man ever to climb the Old Man Of Hoy the year before in 1966. Can you hear me, Chris? I can, fairly well. I’m just trying to work my way out of this overhang. It’s a bit awkward. Through the in the 60s and 70s, there’s a real interest in mountaineering and climbing so whether it’s the Old Man Of Hoy or further afield, there were things the public could get their understanding around, there were obviously big things that had never been done before and there was a real drama in it. It was such an incredible statement, the extraordinary tower jetting off the coast of the Orkneys and this is what captured the imagination of the public. It made fantastic television. Sir Chris hasn’t been back since the broadcast nearly 50 years ago, but he recently turned 80 and while many of us might be taking it easy at that stage, he’s decollided to -- decided to climb it again with his friend and The One Show has gone along. Lee got to the top aged 11. Not many who will have done it at your age. I still have to get there. Quite a journey. We are at the very edge of the UK so it’s got all the elements of world-class adventure climb. Five, six hour drive to get to the ferry, now we are on the other ferry, then we have a half hour drive off Hoy, then half an hour walk with our kit and that is jett just to get to the start of the climb. For us and the equipment it’s hard enough, but for the BBC back in ",,

Now the Labour party’s calling for a change in the law. Good evening. There’s uncertainty in Europe tonight after Greece voted in an anti-austerity Government. The new prime minister Alexis Tsipras has promised to stand up to Brussels and renegotiate the terms of Greece’s massive international bailout. The Greeks have suffered years of austerity, with more than a quarter of its population now out of work. But tonight, Germany and Brussels have warned Greece to stick to the rules, saying there would be no reduction of their huge debt. Our Europe Editor, Gavin Hewitt, reports from Athens After yesterday’s celebrations, storms blew over the Greek capital tonight. All the signs are of difficult negotiations ahead. Europe’s leaders are prepared to talk to Greece’s new Government, but insist it must stick to promises made. Alexis Tsipras arrived at the official residence of the President to be sworn in as Greece’s Prime Minister. The lIo-year-old leader of the radical left party, Syriza, signed alongside the President. The former Communist took office, promising to renegotiate the country’s the eurozone could be at risk. He broke with tradition, taking a civil, rather than a religious oath, refusing a blessing from an orthodox priest. There has been a real urgency to forming this new Government. Injust over a month, Greece’s bailout extension expires. And both the financial markets and the rest of the eurozone don’t want a long period of uncertainty. On the streets, everyone understood the country had taken a dramatic turn, voting for an anti-austerity party. TRANSLATION: It is a change for something different - something new. I hope he’s up to it, I really do. It’s the best count we had to vote and we did, I think. We did well. To give him an overall majority, Alexis Tsipras needed partners. Unexpectedly, he formed a coalition with independent Greek party, fiercely critical of Greece’s bailouts. All the Greeks will be together in Europe. The Greeks have voted for a Government they hope will end hardship and austerity by renegotiating the terms of a £179 billion bailout. As Alexis Tsipras prepares to try and get a better deal for Greece, there were many warnings today from European officials that Greece had to honour commitments already made. TRANSLATION: The new Greek Government will not receive a worse offer, but also not a better offer, meaning that we accept the decision of the Greek people and we expect the Government to accept our conditions. New ministers in Athens insist they can win major concessions while still staying in the eurozone. We will stay in the eurozone. We will stay and work within the institutional framework of Europe. There’s no question about it. Alexis Tsipras’s first visit as Prime Minister was to visit a neighbourhood where the Nazis had executed 200 Communist resistance fighters, underlining his credentials as a left-wing leader. The new Government in Greece is now the first in the EU to reject its bailout deal. Other weak economies - like Spain and Italy - are still tied into large debt repayments. Our economics editor, Robert Peston, has been looking at the impact the Greek vote could have. The Euro- less stable perhaps. The future less certain, following Syriza’s landslide victory. The Greeks rioted against austerity and now they voted against cuts imposed by Brussels and the International Monetary Fund. What did the big squeeze achieve? Unemployment shot UP squeeze achieve? Unemployment shot up to 27%. Youth unemployment over 50%. Incomes were reduced significantly by 35-1+0%. And the extraordinary thing of course is that welfare payments were cut. And that meant that quite a lot of social fabric of Greece was in danger of sort of collapsing. Now, we thought we had it tough here in Britain after the 2008 banking crisis. And although our economy initially shrank by a post-war record 6% and then bumped along the bottom for years our GDP is 2.9% bigger than it was when recession first bit. But in Greece, the contraction was eye wateringly large and has gone on and on and on. Their GDP is still around a quarter smaller than where it was at its peak. What has been the impact of all of this hardship? Has Greece’s debt burden been cut? Quite the opposite. The public sector debt was 109% of GDP six years ago and has risen to 176% of GDP today. So, Greece would dearly like to defer repayments of debts so the economy -- until the economy is growing again. There are elements here where there can be compromise, where I think the sticking point will lie is where the conditions of austerity are insisted on by the creditors and which the new Greek Government will oppose. Financial markets in other weak eurozone economies such as Spain and Italy, which like Greece have seen protests against austerity were relatively stable today. Brussels and Germany signalled they are in no mood to less Greece off its debts or the cuts. No-one can be sure that Greece can and will stay in the eurozone and if the Euro-turned up not to be forever, well money would pour out of the region, bringing financial and economic havoc. After almost 500 years, the Church of England has its first woman Bishop. The Reverend Libby Lane was consecrated at York Minster. The service was led by the Archbishop of York and attended by more than 1,000 worshippers. Danny Savage sent this report. Clergy came to York from all over the world today to witness history being made. joining them were parishioners from Libby Lane’s church in Cheshire, thrilled that their vicar was being made a bishop. Absolutely fantastic. We are so proud of her. It is a wonderful day for us all, and for women. It is about time. So, I’m proud of that, but Libby isjust Libby to us. Libby Lane, at first, took her place alongside her husband, who is also a priest. She wasn’t giving interviews today, but he was. Libby’s quite clear this is not about her, it is about the church, and above all aboutjesus Christ. And Christ being glorified in a church that is complete in all of its ministries. This was a most traditional service for the Church of England’s most modern move. I, Elizabeth jane Holden Lane, Clerk in Holy Orders, chosen Bishop of the Church and of Stockport... The decision to appoint women bishops follows decades of debates, objections, and votes. One past objector is Martin Dales, though even he was here today to witness change at the top. I’m very glad to be here, because I think it is important we are as one. That is what we are meant to be, and we may not all agree on everything all the time. Who does? But we have at least made big strides to at least start the journey. During the service, there was a dramatic interruption. When the Archbishop of York asked the congregation if Libby Lane should be ordained, there was one dissenting voice. No, not in the Bible! With respect, your Grace, I ask to speak on this absolute impediment, please. The challenge was half expected. And was rebuffed with a prepared legal statement. The guy took his opportunity. The Archbishop of York replied by saying legally, we have gone through all the processes, we have prayed about it, our hearts are in the right place. What do you think? The whole congregation, maybe with one exception, shouted, ""We are ready for this"". Our Lord, we pray. The interruption did not affect the outcome. Libby Lane was consecrated as planned and welcomed as the new Bishop of Stockport. For the office and work of a Bishop in your Church. A warm response awaited her outside the Minster as well. There may soon be other female Bishops, but Libby Lane will always be remembered as the first. Ten people have been killed after a Greek fighterjet crashed during a NATO training exercise in Spain. The French and Greek nationals died after the F-16 lost power shortly after take offand flew into an area where a number of other planes were parked. Several people were seriously injured in the crash at the air base. The disgraced former cyclist Lance Armstrong admitted if he could turn back time he would probably cheat again. He was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after being found guilty of doping. He said he wants his life ban lifted. He has spoken exclusively to our sports This is Armstrong country. It is here in Texas that the world’s most infamous sportsman has hidden away for the last two years. These days, there are few signs of the man that used to be Austin’s favourite son, but now, in the bike shop he still owns here, Lance Armstrong gave me a rare insight into how his life changed after he confessed to being a drugs cheat. The fallout has been heavy. Maybe heavier than even I thought. It was pretty brutal afterwards. So, it’s been tough. It’s been trying. Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times in a row. All the more extraordinary having overcome cancer. After years of denying doping allegations, he WGS found to have cheated. The UCI would strip him of his seven Tour de France titles. Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling. Now he feels the time for forgiveness is near. Selfishly I would say, yeah, we’re getting close to that time. I deserved some punishment. Has it gone too far? Of course, I am going to say, yes. Armstrong has been disowned by the cancer charity he founded. Deserted by sponsors and lost millions fighting legal battles, but he insists he’s been made a scapegoat for an era when doping was common place. We’ve got to look at the whole, don’t we have to look at the whole play. You were the ringleader. It was not just the doping, it was the bullying and intimidation, the lying in depositions and the betraying of your friends. Some of that is true, some is not true. There was certainly a dishonesty there that is totally rejecta ble and inexcusa ble. Two years after he confessed to doping here in Austin, Lance Armstrong is now taking his first tentative steps towards what he hopes will be a public rehabilitation. What many Americans want to see is evidence of genuine remorse. When it comes to his use of performance-enhancing drugs, some may be disappointed. If I was racing in 2015, no, I wouldn’t do it again. Because I don’t think you have to do it again. If you take me back to 1995, when it was completely and totally pervasive, I would probably do it again. You don’t like to hear. Armstrong hopes his ban will be reduced after co-operating with world cycling’s investigation into the sport’s troubled past, due to report next month. I was toldly honest. I was totally transparent. I’m not, at this point in my life, I’m not out to protect anybody. These days Armstrong trains alone and has not ridden a bike in months. The fate of a man used to being in control now rests with others. The road to redemption could be a long one. 70 years ago tomorrow, Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland was liberated by Soviet soldiers. It was the largest camp established by the Germans during World War II and has become synonymous with the Nazi plan to wipe out Europe’sjewish population. More than a million people - the vast majority of them jews - were killed at Auschwitz. Our special correspondent, Fergal Keane, is there. Soviet troops arrived here at Auschwitz 70 years ago tomorrow. One of the first to approach the barbed wire noticed emaciated figures staring back at him. ""They were hard to watch,"" he said. Now, on the eve of the anniversary, hundreds of survivors have gathered here to commemorate the dead and to remember not only what happened, but why. The human imagination still struggles to comprehend what was done here. Auschwitz - where humanity comes face to face with its ultimate capacity for evil. More than a million people were victims of the Nazi genocide here. They were gassed, shot, hanged and then burned - men, women, children, babies. SINGING They are voices that were never meant to be heard. 300 survivors are here for the anniversary. But the voice of witness is dwindling with time. A decade ago, there were 1,500. As an 11-year-old prisoner, this man lost his mother, father, two sisters to the death chambers. I don’t believe that I’m here. The horror reached its climax here but it began for many in European cities which they thought civilised, where they felt secure. This woman, arrested in Paris, murdered in Auschwitz. I want to show you - this is my own star. Her daughter escaped the round-up of French jews by French police working for the Nazis. I know immediately at the moment it’s finished. It’s finished for my mother. I never see her. Madeleine was hidden in the countryside by the Resistance. Her mother was taken here from where the French state sent more than 60,000 jews to Auschwitz. I imagined my mother, I imagine the whole family who made the same way, you know. Terrible. COITIE Up, COITIE Up, COITIE Up. Madeleine’s mother was killed when Auschwitz was still in its early stages as an extermination centre. This man was sent to Auschwitz with his family and last saw his mother towards the war’s end. I wanted give her my piece of bread, then at the end I came back with two pieces of bread because she gave me her portion. This was the last time I saw my mother. Nearly quarter of a million children were deported to Auschwitz. From the security of family life, to a place of nightmares. What kept you alive? Luck. I was not very clever, I was not very pretty, I was not very strong. But you were lucky? I was lucky, yes. On the day of liberation, these children were photographed by a Soviet soldier. Among them Gabor, 15 years old, he weighed just over four stone. That’s the boy... For the first time in 70 years he’s been reunited with four other survivors from that photograph. Sure I know him. We have both changed a little bit. For the survivors, Auschwitz is a story of limitless loss, that they feel bound to tell and retell while they still can. And for humanity, it represents a collective moral catastrophe, whose warnings about ethnic, religious and racial hatred go so often unheeded. You can see the mist is swirling around the camp where tomorrow there will be speeches and readings and a documentary film by Steven Spielberg. The main focus, though, will be on the survivors, those who were told by the SS here that the only escape was death. This will almost certainly be the last time many will come here. A public inquiry into the killing of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko opens tomorrow. He was poisoned with radioactive polonium in 2006, but the BBC has learnt that this was the third attempt to kill him in London. The inquiry will investigate whether the Kremlin was involved, although evidence from the intelligence services may be heard in secret. Our Security Correspondent, Gordon Corera, reports. The cause of the illness that was ravaging the body of Alexander Litvinenko was a mystery to medical staff. But he knew he was dying. His widow can still recall his final words with her. He was smiling but in a very, very sad way. I said, ""Don’t worry, I’m coming tomorrow morning, I will stay with you all day"" and he suddenly said, ""I love you so much."" From his hospital bed, he was also able to tell police who he believed was responsible. He was able to speak, able to sign. He said Putin was responsible for his death. Investigators followed a radioactive trail across London and, I understand, that suggested that he was poisoned, not on the first attempt, but the third. Police believe this man, Andrey Lugovoy, actually carried out the killing, along with another man - both deny it. They met Litvinenko, a fierce critic of the Kremlin, at the Pine Bar of London’s Millennium Hotel. Police believe they slipped radioactive polonium into his tea. This was no ordinary murder enquiry, the police officer who oversaw the investigation says. There was a very strong forensic trail left behind because of the way in which it suggested that Litvinenko had been attacked. But what was unusual of course was having radioactivity involved. This was unprecedented. Not all the inquiry will be in public. Material from the intelligence services, which might point to the Kremlin being involved, will be heard in secret. Alexander Litvinenko did carry out work for the British Secret Service, MI6. He received regular payments from them. And even, I understand, was visited in his hospital bed as he lay dying by his MI6 handler, or case officer. But the details of that relationship are unlikely to be heard in the open session of this inquiry. Eight years on, this may be the final opportunity to learn whether Alexander Litvinenko’s death was, as one lawyer puts it, an act of state-sponsored nuclear terrorism, on the streets of London. Gordon Corera, BBC News. NATO has dismissed as ‘nonsense’ claims by Vladimir Putin that NATO soldiers are fighting alongside Ukrainian government troops in Eastern Ukraine. Mr Putin was speaking after an escalation in violence between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels. Our correspondent, Sarah Rainsford, went to the town of Kramatorsk and spoke to some of the civilians who’ve been caught up in the fighting. Helped to safety, away from Ukraine’s front-line. The fighting became too fierce for this man to stay. The journey out was treacherous. This group is the latest to be rescued by volunteers, who say the number needing help is rising. Marina tells me her father-in-law survived the Nazi concentration camp. Now 92, he’s caught up in all this. TRANSLATION: The shooting has never been this bad before. But when the Ukrainian army entered our village, they started shooting at them and we ended up in the firing line. That firing is indiscriminate. A car camera caught this terrifying moment when rockets slammed into streets and into houses. 30 people were killed here. Today, a senior UN official warned that targeting civilians is a war crime. Kiev says Russia’s pored weapons into eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s army is a foreign legion, a foreign legion of NATO’s. That is not in the interests of Ukraine. They have totally different goals. They want to contain Russia. Whatever the politics, these are its victims and all they want is for the shelling to stop. The families here are heading for the safety of western Ukraine, joining the hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced by the conflict here. They have been telling me they held out in their homes for as long as they could, but it is not safe there anymore. They are leaving with little hope of returning soon.

He became a household name in the 1970s with his flowing locks and a trademark kaftan. He sold 60 million albums worldwide. David Sillito looks back at his life. # Ever and ever, forever and ever You’ll be the one... # The beard, the caftans, that plaintive, quivering voice. In the mid-1970s, Demis Roussos had four hit albums in one year. Forever and Ever, one of the inescapable songs of a long, hot summer of 1976. It was a big hit all over the world. It’s a good song. His career had begun alongside a fellow Greek musician, Vangelis, in the band Aphrodite’s Child. # Waiting for a senorita... # His first British solo hit, a song that evoked summer, foreign holidays, sunshine. His image, his allure, a Greek love god who lived the ‘70s superstar lifestyle. And in Mike Leigh’s Abigail’s Party, Demis loomed large. Angela likes Demis Roussos, Tony likes Demis Roussos, I like Demis Roussos and Sue would like to hear Demis Roussos. This man is an enigma... This documentary captures a peak that soon faded, but he continued to perform across Europe. His compatriot, the singer Nana Mouskouri, said today, ""He had a superb voice, he was an artist, a friend."" He was a singer whose music evokes a moment in the ‘70s when love, sun and romance was, for many, an evening with Demis Roussos. # Ever and ever, forever and ever # You’ll be the one... # Demis Roussos, who’s died at the age of 68.

We were all undone by the cranes dipping in salute. It was so grand, but so personal. 70 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the world remembers the victims of the Holocaust. World leaders are gathering in southern Poland - joined by hundreds of survivors of the Holocaust- determined to remind the world of what happened here during the Second World War. More than one million people were murdered at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex - the vast majority of them were jews. We speak to one of the survivors about the importance of informing - and warning- every new generation.

Good afternoon. We’re in southern Poland on the site of the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. 70 years ago today the Soviet Army entered this camp and liberated the few thousand survivors who’d been left behind by the Germans. The vast majority of the victims were jews and today some of those who survived have returned for a major commemoration in the company of heads of state and government from around the world. That event will take place within the next hour but already today there’s been a wreath-laying ceremony as our correspondent Caroline Wyatt reports. Laying wreaths of this morning at the wall of death, where the Nazis executed prisoners with a single shot. Forthe executed prisoners with a single shot. For the survivors who returned, the pain is still raw, 70 years on. By 1945 it was the gas chambers that brought death to Auschwitz on an industrial scale.

Slave Labour and the gas chambers killed over a million here, most of them jews from across Europe. Most of the others deemed less than human were destined for death, among them elliptical pression -- for death, among them elliptical pression -- political prisoners. Around the world parliaments and people stopped to remember. There was no German identity without Auschwitz, and that his country must never forget. Auschwitz, and that his country must neverforget. Francois never forget. Francois Hollande joint Holocaust survivors in France and a jewish community still morning the dad killed in a Paris supermarket by Islamist fundamentalists. The president tried to reassure the jewish community that France remains their home and will protect them from a rise in anti-Semitism. But Auschwitz today, the men and women came back to displays of so much is evil had to steel themselves for the return. Many were just children when they escaped with their lives. 70 years on the survivors who have come here say that it’s more important than ever to bear witness and to tell their story, so that their story at least can live on. I always think about it. It is in front of me. I see it as it happened. She summons the strength to return, she was transported to Auschwitz as a young girl with the parents she was soon to lose. It seemed like an army was awaiting the train, the screaming and bellowing, get off the train, get a move on, be quick. It was so terribly frightening that you cannot describe that. My fatherjumped off. Ijumped after him. By the time Ijumped off I could not see him any more, without a case or goodbye, he disappeared into thin air. I never saw him again. Why return today to a place of such horror? I was one of the lucky ones who survived where so many did not. If we won’t speak out, the world will not know what happened, and that is why we do it. To underline that message, as you walk around Auschwitz it is impossible to comprehend the immense numbers, more than 6 million people were murdered in the Holocaust, 1.5 million children among them. Anne Frank is perhaps the best-known. Whose diary was published in 1947. She and her family were brought here in 1944. Herfather, Otto, survived the war- and remarried. His second wife, Fritzi, and her daughter, Eva, were also survivors of Auschwitz. Eva is now 85, and has spent decades taking her message to schools, colleges, societies, and into prisons. I spoke to her about the day Auschwitz was liberated. Everything was frozen, it was one of the coldest winters on record. We had to hack some ice to get water. We could have gone out but we did not dare to. We were actually very weak. One day, there was a whole lot of Russians came with horses, with guns, and a field kitchen. Fed us. Cabbage soup. It was wonderful, the smell of it. But our bodies could not digest it. It went straight through us. In the morning many people died. Eva lost her father and brother at Auschwitz. Her mother survived, it took Eva 40 years to be able to talk about her suffering and loss. Auschwitz, I got over, but the loss I never did. And, as well, in Auschwitz I had hope, I never gave up. But after the war when I realised life would never get back to what I had expected and hoped for, I became very depressed. As a child in Vienna, I used to be very sporty and out-going, and I had many friends. We had a lovely life in Vienna. We went skiing in the winter and to the lakes and mountains in the summer. Suddenly all of this was gone. I was very bitter. It took me a long, long time to get over this. This is your mother’s passport? It is very interesting because we were Austrians. We did not really want to be Germans at all. But when the Nazis came in we lost our Austrian nationality. We had to become Germans. Then they put aj on everyjewish passport. And as well everyjewish woman besides her ordinary name had to be called Sarah and everyjewish boy had to have Israel next to their own name. That Otto Frank in front of the Anne Frank house. Eva’s stepfather was Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank, he and her mother spent decades safeguarding Anne Frank’s legacy. Mainly her diary. And that duty has been fully embraced by Eva Schloss. They are not there any more to prove what has happened. There will be more people in the end I think coming out and saying, it is just exaggeration and it never happened and so on. That is why it is so important for young people to hear the survivors, see their number and know that this has really happened. few days ago. Lots of those powerful message is that she had will be echoed today. The commemoration takes place at a few yards away in a specially constructive tent in around an hour ‘s time. A decade ago over the 60th anniversary there were 1500 survivors here. This year we are expecting around 300. just to underline the message that Eva was giving, as the generations come, the new generations, it is so important for survivors to be heard with respect and admiration for what they did, many of them, to rebuild their lives after the unspeakable brutality of this camp and many others. Continuing coverage throughout the day as that major events takes place. In the meantime, it is back to you, Simon. It’s a hundred days to go before the general election on the seventh of May - and all three parties have stepped up their campaigns. The Conservatives have been concentrating on benefits for pensioners - while for Labour it’s been the NHS. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats say they represent the moderate alternative to the other two parties. Here’s our political correspondent, Ross Hawkins. The two men who want to run the country for the next five years, both trying to dictate the terms of the campaign debate. Fighting on their favoured ground. For the Conservatives their favoured ground. For the Conservatives it is welfare and Labour it is health. Labour says it has a 10-year plan for the NHS in England, promising 5000 new home care workers in the health service, helping to end 15 minute care visits, pledging an extra £2.5 billion a year for the health service. We must invest in the NHS so it has time to care, and join up services at every stage from home to hospital, so that people can get the care they need when they need it. That is the key principle to make our NHS sustainable and successful for years to come. Conservatives will protect NHS funding but David Cameron wants a debate about welfare and work, cutting the benefit cap from 26 to £23,000. Stripping housing benefit from unemployed young people to fund apprenticeships and inviting broadcasters to Downing Street to explain that it means more jobs and more work. We think this is absolutely crucial to making sure that more young people can get good, well paid, successfuljobs and build a secure future for themselves and their families. a secure future for themselves and theirfamilies. From numberten he went to the BBC to hint that pension benefits like free bus passes might go untouched for another parliament if he wins. There would not be huge savings if they were axed, he said. His campaign was marked by the Lib Dems, publishing this parody other Tory poster to insist they would restrain the other parties. If that sounds familiar, it is no surprise. These core messages were hammered out by party leaders a long time ago and they will go on repeating them until they are etched into the voters minds. -- until they are etched into the voters minds. -- this parody of a Tory poster. They are pretty much level pegging in the polls, getting people to listen is one thing, but persuading them is quite another. Our assistant political editor Norman Smith is in Westminster. The battle lines are getting clearer, aren’t they? Simon Khan I thought this election campaign was beginning to resemble one of those Battenberg cakes, the ones that have clear lines running through the middle of them. -- clear lines running through the middle of them. -- Simon, I thought. The Tories have a clear line on the economy and Labour on the NHS but we have a new dividing line today over pensioners and specifically wealthy pensioners with the Prime Minister giving a clear indication that he will allow all pensioners to keep free benefits including wealthy pensioners. Like the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences, free bus passes. That is different from Labour and the Lib Dems, Labour would remove from wealthy pensioners their winter fuel allowance and the Lib Dems would take away their TV licences, the argument being that at the time of austerity with more spending cuts, wealthy pensioners have the bear their share of the pain and they also ask, do really rather rich pensioners need help with heating bills? Mr Cameron’s responds, it would not save much money and why should people have the make this sort of adjustment in retirement? One further calculation, he mayjust recognise that pensioners tend to vote! Thank you very much. There was mixed news on the British economy today - with latest figures suggesting that it grew by 2.6%. That’s the highest level since 2007 - but that the rate of growth seems to be slowing. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of growth slowed towards the end of the year to 0.5%. Our economics correspondent Andy Verity reports. This Merseyside company is among the firms driving economic growth, it may look like a manufacturer but is part of the business of exporting services, it maintains engines like this one and captures waste heat to turnit this one and captures waste heat to turn it into electricity and it sells that service abroad from Nigeria to Australia. The economy is performing, with manufacturing services and construction all contributing. However, Ifeel there is potential for a slow up contributing.

Or plan is protecting Britain from the economic storm with the fastest growth of any major economy in 2014. The good you can see on the shelves represent a business that is an example of sustainable growth. By investing in its people, investing in the business, and winning loyal customers, it is avoided the pitfalls of boom and bust, grown throughout the recession and paid inflation beating pay rises. Not every part of the economy is showing that sustainable growth. In the fourth quarter of last year the economy grew by 0.5% as a whole. Slower than the two previous quarter, break down the figures and the recovery is heavily weighted to services. Production, from manufacturing, to energy and water, was down 0.1%. Now we know the economy is slowing again, construction down, MP manufacturing flat, this isn’t good enough, we need a plan, which will deliver riding living standards for working people, that means more growth, more investment, a proer Labour plan. The economy is now more than 3% bigger than before the crash. Firms like this are boosting exports imports are up by even more and consumer spending is growing faster than wages.

More than 5,000 flights have been cancelled, with more than two foot of snow predicted for some areas. Meteorologists are warning of wind gusts of more than 70 miles an hour. The New York authorities have imposed a ban on the use of private cars from 11pm tonight, and all schools have been closed. Gary O’Donoghue reports from Boston. From Maine to Philadelphia, the North East of the United States is shutting down to prepare for one of the worst winter storms in decades. An emergency has been declared in several states, closing schools, government agencies and banning most vehicles from the roads. In Massachusetts, 800 snowploughs and gritters are hitting the streets. Boston residents are preparing for the worst. Candles, flashlights, extra batteries, radios, board games. I have three children at home. In New York, the subway shut earlier, Broadway boarded-up theatres and New Yorkers struggled with the elements as they headed home to sit out the onslaught. We bought $40 worth of food, we will sit it out. This is the calm before the storm, it is about to start in earnest and it will come in fast and hard, and people have to be very careful. Widespread disruption of public services is expected over the next few days with thousands of flights already cancelled. the next few days, with thousands Train operators warning of limited or no service. Here in Massachusetts, the blizzard is really starting to kick in. Parts of the state are expecting up to 30 inches of snow and there could be hurricane force winds on the coast bringing power winds on the coast, bringing power outages and flooding. The North East of the United States is bracing itself for a bad couple of days. In a moment, we’ll get all the latest from our correspondent in Boston, but first Laura Trevelyan is in New York’s Central Park. It looks like a ghost town, baur a? E all from the first leg. It looks like a ghost town, baur a? It certainly has been. -- It looks like a ghost town, baur a? It certainly has been. -- Laura. We only had seven inches of snow, not two to three feet forecast. A lot of New Yorkers are taking to social media saying what happened to snowmageddon? The city is coming back to life. The subways are re-opening, the travel ban has been lifted. Even though the storm wasn’t so bad here in the most populated city, in America, it has been a different story. What happened was the storm really tracked about 50 miles to the east of the forecasted track, so out on long island, they really have been hammered, and there they have seen at least 20 inches of snow, they had winds of over 35mph, and in rural Connecticut and in Massachusetts still blizzard conditions goes on there. Thank you Laura. And Gary O’Donoghue is in Boston. You have the snow there? It is falling across Massachusett, they are expecting the snow to continue for another four hours or so. The winds to start to gust up to 60mph, in Boston here, and much higher, round 75, 76mph on Cape Cod and the islands of Nantucket, Martha’s vineyard. Western Massachusetts didn’t get hit as hard as expected. They have had a foot of snow. There are about 13,000 people in the sort of Boston Massachusetts area without power. That is a substantial amount lower than the authorities were expecting, so it does look like their precautions have taken effect. People have heeded the advice to stay at home, to stay indoor, and so far, so farfingers stay at home, to stay indoor, and so far, so far fingers crossed, far, so farfingers crossed, no-one has been seriously hurt. Thank you both very much. Gary Glitter has taken the stand for the first time at his trial for alleged historical sex offences against three girls. The 70-year-old, whose real name is Paul Gadd, denies 10 charges dating back to the 1970s and 80s. Our correspondent Daniela Relph is at Southwark Crown Court. Yes, he began after 12.15 today. He is of course in court here, known as Paul Gadd, he is sitting in the dock, wearing a hearing aid. He has an assistant sitting next to him. He said he is profoundly deaf. If he can’t hear some of the questions she is able to repeat them back to him. His barrister asked a direct question, the question that is at the heart of the case case she said you have been charged with sexual offences on three young women. Did you sexually assault any of those girls? He replied clearly, no, I did not. The evidence and the questioning has gone on the focus on his childhood and musical career. He has talked about the height of Glitz irmania, how the fans wanted to get close to him. How he had 400 people outside his house in London, it was a crazy time, he said that happened in the mid 70s and that is when things kicked off. Detectives investigating the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross say Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns would have been charged with her murder, had he not killed himself. The Metropolitan Police say his most likely motive was sexual. 14-year-old Alice’s body was found in the River Brent in West London in September, a month after she went missing. The body of Zalkalns was discovered in woodland four days later. Arnis Zalkalns, a Latvian builder buying beer in a west London corner shop, just a few hours after Alice Gross was killed. Police said today they are satisfied that he was the murderer. Alice Gross was 14-year-old, a keen song writer, and a much loved daughter, sister and friend. But on the 28th August last year, she went missing. Snatches of her last walk along the River Brent recorded on CCTV camera, and caught on the same cameras, the same afternoon, Arnis Zalkalns on his bike. Despite a massive police search, it took more than a month to find her body. She had been crushed to death and dumped in the river, naked, wrapped in bin bag, and weighed down by logs a bicycle wheel and brick, also found at the scene, a cigarette butt with Arnis Zalkalns’s DNA on it. When police discovered her shoes they had his DNA on it as well. Arnis Zalkalns was responsible for the murder of Alice Gross. We have had our evidence assessed by the Crown Prosecution Service, and it is their conclusions that were Arnis Zalkalns alive today, they would authorise a charge for murder of Alice. A trawl through CCTV cameras showed Arnis Zalkalns leaving the scene on his bike, soon after the murder. Then, revisiting it three time, once that night, and twice the next day. The case from Alice Gross 's phone was found under his patio. He was found dead 37 days after the murder. He had apparently hanged himselfment he came to the UK in 2007, nine years after being convicted of murdering his wife. Alice Gross ‘s family say they remain unimportant unanswered questions about what the British authorities should have known about her killer, when he first arrived in Britain. A public inquiry has opened into the murder in London of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. He was poisoned more than eight years ago with a radioactive substance, polonium. Litvinenko had become an outspoken critic of the Kremlin when he was killed, and it’s thought the inquiry will be told that there were two other attempts on his life. Our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, reports. HITE Eight years on from his death an inquiry into Alexander Litvinenko’s death finally begins. A judge sitting as chairman makes clear it its importance In short, I shall carry out a full and independent inquiry into the circumstances of the death of Alexander Litvinenko. Alexander Litvinenko was a foors critic of the Kremlin and died a long painful deathin Kremlin and died a long painful death in a London hospital bed in 2006. The cause of his death initially a mystery until traces of polonium were found. Police believe he was given a fatal dose in a cup of tea, at this hotel. And they believe this man, Andrei Lugovoi, along with’d Dmitry Kovtun were involved in administering it. They deny involvement. Over 70 witnesses are expected to be called to give evidence. Today, we heard that two of those might be Andrei Lugovoi, and Dmitry Kovtun. But, if they do decide to give evidence, it will only be by video, and not in person. Police followed a radioactive trail across London and beyond linked to the two men, thousands of other people the inquiry heard could have been at risk. But the crucial question remains. Why was Mr Alexander Litvinenko killed? It was made clear in court today that some issues would not be examined in public, including some details of his relationship with MI 6. Could this have played a role if Russia had learned about it? That was asked. Evidence which points to the role of the Kremlin in the killing may also been heard in secret. Police will begin giving evidence tomorrow, a final report into the death which some have called a state sponsored act of nuclear terrorism will come by the end of the year. Britain’s Andy Murray is through to the semi-finals of the Australian Open. He beat the 19-year-old home favourite Nick Kyrgios in four sets. Murray will now face Tomas Berdych for a place in the final, after he defeated Rafael Nadal. Our sports correspondent joe Wilson reports. Nick Kyrgios is about brightness, of course Australia needs that but the wider world of tennis too. His brash talent knocked Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon, you may recall. Now it was Andy Murray’s turn to meet the man who is still a teenager, the best way to deal with exuberance is to stifle it with accuracy. Nick Kyrgios was capable of producing shots to surprise Murray, maybe even to surprise himself. Second set went to a tie-break. The young man had fought with all his might to stay in the contest, and thend maybe even to surprise himself. Second set went to a tie-break. The young man had fought with all his might to stay in the contest, and thend Murray does this. -- then. That was the second set. Nick Kyrgios isjust starting the process of dealing with home nation expectation. Even when he was struggling, he was still entertaining. What can you do? Nick Kyrgios didn’t suffer in silence. An audible obscenity earned him a code violation. Not his first. Murray controlled his young opponent, chasing in vain. Victory after three sets from Andy Murray. just tried to play the best with what the conditions were, allowing you to do. I think I did that quite well. In the semifinal Murray expected to play Rafael Nadal, but no, the Spaniard beaten by Thomas Berdych. A worthy player in his own right of course but a beatable opponent for Murray? Certainly.

Away from tennis, lance arm strong has hit out at the President of the international cycle union saying he has not delivered on his promise to be tough on doping. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for taking performance enhancing drugs. Armstrong has been unimpressed with the President so far, particularly his decision to allow the team to retain their World Tour license, despite a number of positive doping tests If McQuaid would have made the same decisions is as Cookson made in the first year of his presidency, you know, the rush with Froome, the handling of the team positive, he, they would have had him, he would have been Lynched. Will doping always be part of sport? The temptation to cut corners will always be there. Especially in an event like the Tour. It is hard. The real key thing, with the cultural shift that started in 2006, how strong is it? It is going to be tested. There is going to be something. If not EPO it might be XYZ, whatever. It will come along and test that culture. Rangers will borrow money from Mike Ashley to stay afloat, 5 million will be made available from the sports direct company as working capital. It is secured against their assets but not Ibrox. Liverpooltravel secured against their assets but not Ibrox. Liverpool travel to Stamford Bridge Ibrox. Liverpool travel to Stamford Bridge tonight for the second leg of their League Cup semifinal against Chelsea. It is 1-1 after the first leg. Brendan Rodgers things that Chelsea will have a greater motivation to reach Wembley after that shock defeat in the FA Cup by Bradford City. They lost 4-2 at home on Saturday having led 2-0. The result at the weekend does not help. Obviously there will be a great motivation to go out, in a different game, different competition, but certainly when you come off a game like that you want to put it right. There is also that in the back of your mind that even if you are up in the game like they were, 2-0, you can still lose the game. I think there will be a bit of trepidation. But also the motivation to get the results. There has been reports in the US that the NFL is looking into the New England Patriots’ locker room attendant as it investigates the deflate gate controversy. It is alleged they used underinflated footballs. The attendant has been shown taking the balls into a room before going out onto the field. If the investigation is not able to definitively determined that our organisation tampered with the air pressure on the footballs, I would expect and hope that the league would apologise to our entire team and in particular coach Bela check and Tom Brady for what they have had to ensure this past week. -- Bill that was the owner defending his team ahead of the Super Bowl. The charity Oxfam has called for a massive post-Ebola recovery programme for West Africa to get the countries hit by the crisis back on their feet. The agency is calling for a multi-million dollar conference to raise money for a post Ebola Marshall plan, a reference to the plan set up in Europe after the Second World War. The death toll is now slowing, but the world ‘s deadliest Ebola outbreak has ravaged countries, communities and countless lives. When it first began a year ago, the international community was slow to respond. Oxfam says it must not walk away now that cases of the virus are dropping. The world must not fail the people of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone again. They were desperately poor before, they’re weak health services were one of the reasons the epidemic spread so fast. We are saying, let’s get children back to school and health services restored, let’s inject capital in a way that gets poor people getting spending power, people have lost income, lostjobs, many are going hungry. We have to get behind the recovery. Schools in Guinea reopened last week but it will be much harder to restart economy devastated by the disease. In Liberia, Ebola has put almost half of the country ‘s workers out of work. Farmers were kept from fields by illness or fear, businesses have been crippled by the crisis. Shortages of food have led to rising prices. Stephen was lucky enough to survive Ebola but he is worried about how to feed 13 mouths. It is not easy to feed 13 in this situation. It is very hard. I am a single parent, finding food is not easy. Oxfam says that people have been through hell, millions of families need cash and the governments need help with sanitation. There is no room for complacency. These are Ebola orphans. The medical charity Medecins some Frontier warns that a single case could reignite an outbreak. -- MS F. A pilot in Hawaii had to make an emergency landing with a parachute which saved the entire plane. When this single engine plane ran out of fuel the pilot was able to safely land in the open ocean. He then inflated liferaft and was picked up by the coastguard unharmed. Now it is time for a look at the weather. Darren has the details. We have been reporting on snow in America. Snow is on the way here as well, let’s start with the one in the United States. It is further north and east, so the heaviest snow will be north of New York into New England and across Canada. We are in for a cold and snowy smell of -- spell of weather in the UK, but our cold weather will come from Greenland initially. You can see the snow clouds there. It comes in behind this belt of cloud. Ahead of that today we have mild conditions across the UK, very quiet and dry, but a lot of cloud. The best of the sunshine is in East England. There is not much rain around except in the East of Scotland. The breeze will blow in mild hair with temperatures above average for this time of year. Things start to change tonight and tomorrow. This evening it turns wet and windy across Scotland and Northern Ireland. That wind and rain pushes down into England and Wales. The showers following and eventually turning wintry. Forthe morning rush following and eventually turning wintry. For the morning rush hour for England and Wales it will be a mild start with temperatures 8-10. It will be cloudy and windy and some spells of rain. As we had were the north, we are starting to push into that area of cold air across the Northern Pennines. Most sleet and snow falling in Scotland and Northern Ireland. No major impact for the morning rush-hour in the central belt of Scotland, and not for Northern Ireland but it could be different for the evening rush-hour. It will clear the south-east early in the afternoon and then it will be quite sunny for awhile. Wintry showers for Northern England and the North of Wales. Most showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland through the day as the egg gets colder and colder. Temperatures will be dropping and dropping as the day goes on. -- as the day gets colder. We could get sleet and snow further south briefly, the wind pushing the shell is through quickly. During the day we will see sunshine in between the showers as well. Lots of snow is piling up across the North with blizzards across higher ground. It really will feel cold. It will feel a few degrees below freezing. Changes on the way. We have warnings in the northern part of the UK. The greatest disruption is across northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland although there will be snow showers on Wednesday night further south. Keep up to date on local radio and on the Twitter feed. Thanks a lot. That is it from us. Now it is time for the news where you are. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, I’m Asad Ahmad. London Ambulance Service staff will go on strike this Thursday - in a dispute over pay. The walk-out is taking place during the busiest ever winter for London’s ambulances - so the pressure on the NHS could be acute. So our correspondent, Karl Mercer has been to meet paramedics who find themselves on the frontline between the health service and patients. Listen to my questions... They are taking more calls than ever in their history. And they are responding to more calls than ever. At the moment she has said she has fallen off her scooter. Lee has been a paramedic for four years. It is a job that comes with daily frustrations. That hasjust been cancelled. The next job is only minutes away. We are off... I have not got many details yet. just says chest pain at the moment. They are pleased to see us. It probably wasn’t an emergency. But for him, he obviously felt like he was very unwell earlier. I am not sure why he waited five days to call us. But that’s what happens. On its busiest days London’s Ambulance Service is taking more than 6000 calls. Managing demand is hard, managing expectations can be just as difficult. You never know what will happen next, sometimes you answer the phone and you have got somebody who has cut their finger and you are thinking, you really phoned 999 for this? But then sometimes you hang up and you take the next call and it is someone who has found their friend not breathing. You just don’t know what you are going to get next. The control room in Waterloo now has an extra layer of nurses and paramedics offering advice to both their colleagues and patients. The aim is to send ambulances only to those who need them most. Not everybody wants to do it and it is difficult, it is hard work because you have not got the cues of being on scene and looking at somebody so it is hard work. The service at the moment is missing response times. But under a pilot scheme, they will be given longer to assess whether an ambulance should be sent. The winter rush may have gone but this is a service that is still under pressure, short of around 400 paramedics, it is recruiting hard. But also trying to find new ways of working with what it has. A separate, segregated cycle 'superhighway’ along Embankment is to go-ahead - despite strong opposition from Taxi drivers and the City of London. It’ll provide cyclists a link between Hyde Park and Tower Hill - but there’s concern that traffic will increase for other vehicles. Work could begin in April with the route ready 12 months later. The mayor is giving his backing to the proposal. We are here at the junction of the superhighways. They will be wonderfulfor junction of the superhighways. They will be wonderful for cyclists who may be a bit more apprehensive about cycling. It is something that Londoners have been clamouring for for the past five or six years. People want safer cycling. We are determined to do it. We can’t pretend there won’t be in packs on the road network, that’s absolutely right, somejourneys the road network, that’s absolutely right, some journeys will be faster and some will be a little bit slower. Obviously we work very hard to minimise those impacts. This years Oscar-nominated west London actor, Benedict Cumberbatch has apologised after referring to black actors as ""coloured"" - during an interview on American television. The star of BBC One’s 'Sherlock’ used the term while talking about the lack of opportunities for black British actors in the UK. He’s been criticised by anti-racism campaigners who say the term is outdated and can cause offence. Now the weather with Kate... Good afternoon. One or two Britos sunny spells but the cloud will gradually and slowly increase. Quite a calm afternoon with the wind reasonably light and temperature is not faring badly either. Around ",,

At a ceremony held on the site of the former concentration camp, survivors have beenjoined by world leaders - here in southern Poland - with a message for generations to come. We survivors do not want our past to be our children’s future. They’ve come here to remember more than one million people murdered at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex, and more than six million victims of the Nazi killing machine - most of them jewish. We speak to one of the survivors, a young girl at Auschwitz, about the importance of informing - and warning- every new generation.

And a radical plan to create a segregated cycle lane through central London gets the green light. over to the NHS Fourteen stories high, with twenty-nine operating theatres and thirteen hundred beds - we get a tour of the new South Glasgow University Hospital. Good evening. We’re in southern Poland on the site of the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz- Birke nau. 70 years ago today the Soviet Army entered this camp and liberated the few thousand survivors who’d been left behind by the Germans. The vast majority of the victims were jews and today some of those who survived have returned in the company of heads of state and government from around the world. They heard one message with great force and clarity - that the world must never forget what happened here and in the other Nazi death camps of the Second World War. Our correspondent Caroline Wyatt watched the day’s events. A haunting melody based on the songs of the survivors of the Holocaust. Despite their age and their frailty, many of them returned to Auschwitz today, still defiantly alive. As the world watched, and heads of state listened, the survivors came to bear witness at the railway track that brought so many to their death. The President of Poland called them the guardians of the memories of Auschwitz, a testimony more vital than ever. Then a tiny figure, a survivor and poets, took to the stage to give voice to the voiceless. TRANSLATION: Those robbed first of their identity then of their lives. The Nazis knew her as prisoner 48693. A child when she arrived, she remembered the bottomless pit of hell that she could not escape, around her, barbed wire and stinking mud, and figure is young and old with shaven heads. Grey faces and legs like sticks. She remembered the agony, the hunger, always surrounding them. Death. We do not want our past to be our children’s future. Now in his 80s, Roman survived today to speak of moral courage, the courage to do right. We survivors do not want our passed to be our children’s future. -- our past. The liberation came too late to save this woman’s father, mother and sister. She wasjust15. In memory of the 6 millionjews of Europe murdered in the Holocaust, survivors and their families walked together into the darkness once again. They shone a brief light on the evil that was done here. And the knowledge that there would be soon to bear witness, fewer people to say never again. As you walk around the site here at Auschwitz it is impossible to comprehend the immense numbers of the Holocaust- more than 6 million murdered, one and a half million children among them - perhaps the best known is Ann Frank, whose diary was published in 1947. She and her family were brought here in 1944. Herfather, Otto, survived the war and remarried. His second wife, Fritzi, and her daughter, Eva, were also survivors of Auschwitz. Eva is now 85, and has spent decades taking her message to schools, colleges, societies, and into prisons. I spoke to her about the day Auschwitz was liberated. Everything was frozen, it was one of the coldest winters on record. We had to hack at the ice to get water. There was pond outside. We could have gone out but we did not dare to. We were actually very weak. One day, a whole lot of Russians came with horses, with guns, and a field kitchen. They put it up for us there. They fed us with cabbage soup. It was wonderful, the smell of it. But our bodies could not digest it. It went straight through us. And in the morning many people had died. Eva lost her father and brother at Auschwitz. Her mother survived - it took Eva 40 years to be able to talk about her suffering and loss. About Auschwitz, I got over, but the loss I never did. And, as well, in Auschwitz I had hope and I never gave up. But after the war when I realised life would never get back to what I had expected and hoped for, I became very, very depressed. As a child in Vienna, I used to be very sporty and outgoing, and I had many friends. We had a lovely life in Vienna. We went skiing in the winter and to the lakes and mountains in the summer with my father. Suddenly all of this was gone. I was very bitter. It took me a long, long time to get over this. This is your mother’s passport? Which is very interesting because we were Austrians. We didn’t really want to be Germans at all but when the Nazis came in we lost our Austrian nationality. We had to become Germans. And then they put aj on everyjewish passport and as well everyjewish woman, beside their ordinary name, had to be called Sarah and every jewish boy and man had to be called Israel next to their own name. This was Otto in front of Anne Frank’s house. Eva’s step father was Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank. He and Eva’s mother spent decades protecting her legacy, mainly her diary, and that duty has been fully embraced by Eva Schloss. They are not there any more to prove what has happened. But there will be more people in the end coming up and saying it is just exaggeration, it never happened, and so on. So that is why it’s so important for young people to hear survivors still and see their number and know that it really has happened. That was Eva Sloss talking to me a few days ago. She is now 85. Fergal, what did you make of the messages we have heard today? The most profound and consistent message is that the pastis and consistent message is that the past is always present. The legacy of the death camps are still with us in a world beset by genocide and crimes against humanity and the persecution of minorities. By attacks like those in Paris, anti-Semitic attacks. It still exists in the world. Legal protections introduced in 1948 have not stopped bad virus of hatred as one survivor put it, from damaging peoples lives. -- one survivor put it, from damaging peoples lives. -- have not stopped virus. There will be more on today’s events at our scripts later but for now it is back to you. -- Auschwitz. There was mixed news on the British economy today with latest figures suggesting that it grew by 2.6% last year - that’s the highest level since 2007 - but the rate of growth seems to be slowing. Figures from the Office for National Statistics shows gross domestic product - the value of all goods and services produced in the UK - grew 0.5% for the last part of the year. Our economics correspondent Andy Verity reports. This Merseyside company has achieved the sort of steady growth that politicians say they want for the whole economy. It installs and maintains engines like this one that capture waste heat and turn it into power. It exports services abroad from Nigeria to Australia. I think the economy is performing, with manufacturing services and construction all contributing. However, I feel there construction all contributing. However, Ifeel there is potential for a slow up in the economy, whether that is temporary or not I’m not sure. Clearly there is momentum in the British recovery, you see that in GDP data and the factjobs are being created all around the country. One of the exciting things at the moment is that we are seeing job creation faster in the North of England than in the south. The goods you can see on these shelves represent a business that is an example of sustainable growth. I investing in its people, investing in the business, and winning loyal customers, it has avoided the pitfalls of boom and bust, it has grown throughout the recession and paid inflation beating pay rises. Not every part of the economy is showing sustainable growth. The economy grew by 0.5% as a whole, slower than in the previous quarters. Break down the figures and the recovery is weighted to services, up 0.8%. Production from manufacturing to energy and water was down 0.1%. This is not good enough, we need a plan which will deliver rising living standards for working people and that means more growth and investment and a proper Labour plan. A key part of the plan has been to train 125,000 new apprentices. Young people like Robin Gray who has finished her apprenticeship and started work. I had a £10,000 increase to come here, I am in my mid 20s at the moment. At this place it isjust I am in my mid 20s at the moment. At this place it is just opting off and it will only go up hopefully. Today the Conservatives stole Labour’s clothes, promising 3 million apprenticeships, partly paid for by reducing the cap on benefits from £26,000 a year to 23,000. The economic engine may be cooling down but today the Tories also hinted they would not cut benefits for wealthy pensioners like free bus passes. The political battle is heating up. Well, as the main parties marked the 100 days to go before the election by stepping up their campaigns - Labour chose to concentrate on the NHS, pledging to recruit 5000 more healthcare workers to help patients stay in their homes. Here’s our health editor Hugh Pym. Good morning. I have also got my appointment to see the rheumatologist... A reassuring phone call is what is needed to help with complex issues, it is part of her plan to help her cope with her depression and mobility problems. You need to contact all of these people and you can’t face doing it. It is a lot easierjust to be able to pick up the phone. And ring that person. It gets spread out and dealt with. Thanks to a pioneering scheme in Greenwich in south London she has one point of contact for her health and housing needs. That is Sue, part of a combined service of social care staff, and this initiative is supported by the government. Being integrated allows us to give her the help she needs. Labour wants to break down the barrier between health and social care with a joined UP health and social care with a joined up approach to looking after patients, either in their homes or hospitals. But actually implementing it will be a major financial and organisational challenge. Labour ‘s plans include 5000 home care workers, a new role in the NHS. Help for GPs to identify the vulnerable elderly and a pledge to end the 15 minute restriction on some home care visits. The Labour leader has promised if elected to spend £2.5 billion extra on the NHS, but there is no commitment on social care spending. He says that in the long-term the will save money. If we keep people in their home for longer we can do something about the 1 million bed days being lost by elderly people in hospital when they do not need to be there. If you would increase funding how can people believe you? It is deliverable and all of our plans are credible, funded and costed. Are the plans really deliverable in practice? Some health experts have doubts. This will involve major structural change, Labour argues it would involve top-down reorganisation, many people will be sceptical. We need much more detail before we can reach a considered judgement. Labouralso before we can reach a considered judgement. Labour also said it would increase training places for nurses in England with an extra 2000 a year above the current level of 19,000. The Conservatives accused Labour of spending the same money twice and making unfunded spending commitments which would put the NHS at risk. Let’s talk to our deputy political editor, james Landale, who’s at Westminster. The main parties have taken the opportunity of 100 days to go until the election to state - or re-state - some of their key election pledges? That is right. The parties are trying to establish the question that will be in the minds of voters when they finally go to the poles in 14 weeks time. Labour want that question to be - 14 weeks time. Labour want that question to be - which party will best protect the NHS. The Tories want it to be - best protect the NHS. The Tories want it to be - which party would best protect the economic recovery? The Lib Dems want to be about which party will keep the other two on the straight and narrow. We had Labour’s plan for the NHS for the next 10 years. The Tories said, if you want a strong NHS, you have to have a strong economy. Responded by announcing their plans for more apprentices, less welfare and probably concurring on protecting pensioners from welfare benefits in the future. They are trying to establish the ground on which this election is fought. They want it to be on their ground. They’re not going to let up until May 7th. james Landale, at Westminster, thank you. 70 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, a ceremony is held at the former concentration camp to remember the victims of the Holocaust.

And, beating the blues: After FA Cup humiliation, can Chelsea bounce back in tonight’s League Cup clash with Liverpool? key milestone. And, Rangers agree a £10 million emergency loan with Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct firm. The United Nations has secured a pledge for the release of about 3,000 child soldiers in South Sudan. The children, aged between 11 and 17, were recruited by the South Sudan Democratic Army - one of the factions in a conflict that started in 2013 when fighting erupted in the world’s newest nation between groups loyal to the President and to his Deputy. At least 10,000 people have died in that conflict and more than a million have been displaced, 280 children were released today, and UNICEF hopes there will be more in the next month. Ed Thomas was there and sent this report. They are the boy soldiers of South Sudan. The rebel fighters of Cobra Faction. And children who struggle to hold their rifles. We cannot show you their faces, we can bring you their stories. We changed their names to protect their identities. , ""I had an AK-47. I haven’t seen my family for two years. I’ve seen many people killed. Abraham, what did you see, what did you do? ""I fought because I was scared for my life. Two of my sisters were murdered. I’d like to go to school now. "" Today, they are all free. Their militia, the Cobra faction has signed a peace deal. It means the children can finally put down their weapons. There is celebration here. But these children carry the weight of men. They are veterans of war. For many of these young boys, the conflict in South Sudan is all they’ve known. Injust over a year, the brutal civil war here has taken 50,000 lives. The future of these young soldiers depends on the commanders who, too easily, send them to fight. General, do you promise never to use these children again as soldiers? TRANSLATION: I will promise you we’re not going to use them. But it was environment of war which has encouraged us to use children to the war. It’s a promise child soldiers like Peter depend on. How do you feel today, like Peter depend on. How do you feeltoday, now feel today, now you’re free? I’m not afraid. You’re not afraid? Yeah. What do you want to do now? I want to become a pastor. So I need to teach people about the Bible. 3,000 child fighters will be released. Despite the brutality, they have the chance to begin again. Ed Thomas, BBC News, South Sudan. The murder of a former Russian spy in London eight years ago was an act of ""nuclear terrorism"" on the streets of a major city. Those were the words of the barrister representing the widow of Alexander Litvinenko at the start of the public inquiry into his death. He died in hospital after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium while meeting two Russians in London. Moscow has refused to extradite the men, both of whom deny any involvement. Our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, has more. Marina Litvinenko arriving at court looking for answers. Eight years on, the question remains, who was behind her husband’s death? Her lawyer today made clear who he thought was to blame. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a Mafia state. Alexander Litvinenko was murdered, as he was trying to expose this odious and deadly corruption. Andrei Lugovoi is one of two men accused of carrying out the killing, both deny it. He made three trips to London over a month each time, I understand, carrying radioactive polonium, the first was October 16th to 18th. It emerged today Litvinenko may have been poisoned at an office, but at a low level, so he thought it was food poisoning. The second visit was October 25th to 28th. But it doesn’t appear that there was a chance to deliver the polonium. The third visit was October 31st to November 3rd. On November1st, the fatal dose is believed to have been slipped into a cup of tea. That happened at the Millennium Hotel, where Litvinenko met Andrei Lugovoi and the second suspect, Dmitry Kovtun. He fell ill that evening and died slowly over the next three weeks. We heard today that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun would be invited to give evidence to the inquiry, but via videolink from Moscow and not in person. Both men would be arrested if they return to London. Dmitry Kovtun, seen here with Lugovoi, was said today to have asked a contact if he knew a cook in London. Mr Kovtun said that he had a very expensive poison and that he needed the cook to put the poison in Mr Litvinenko’s food or drink. The secrets of this former Russian spy’s life, and death, are now being revealed. Gordon Corera, BBC News. Planned strikes by health workers in a row over pay have been suspended. Staff from the GMB Unison and Unite unions were due to walk out in England and Northern Ireland on Thursday in protest at the Government’s refusal to accept a recommended 1% wage rise for all NHS staff. New proposals will now be put to workers. Andy Murray has a third Grand Slam title in his sights. He’s reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open after a straight sets victory in Melbourne, beating the local hero, Nick Kyrgios. joe Wilson reports. Nick Kyrgios is all about brightness. Of course, Australia needs that, but the wider world of tennis too. His brash talent knocked Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon, you may recall. Now it was Andy Murray’s turn to meet the man who is still a teenager. The best way to deal with exuberance is to stifle it with accuracy. COMMENTATOR: That’s wide! Kyrgios was still capable of producing shots to surprise Murray, maybe even to surprise himself. The second set went to a tie-break. The young man had fought with all his might to stay in the contest, and then Murray does this. COMMENTATOR: Oh, that’s outstanding! That was the second set. Match point was like so many which had proceeded it, with Murray controlling, his young opponent chasing in vain. Victory, after three consummate sets, from Andy Murray. You know, I thought I dealt with the atmosphere and the crowd fairly well, which you know could have been tough. So I’m happy with that. In the semi-final, Murray had expected to play Rafael Nadal but, no, the Spaniard beaten earlier by Tomas Berdych, a worthy player in his own right, of course, but a beatable opponent for Murray, certainly. joe Wilson, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather, here’s Nina Ridge. It’s been quiet today. Not too bad temperature wise, despite there being quite a bit of cloud, we have managed eight or nine degrees. Things are turning colder tomorrow. Temperatures will be around three. That is half the story. There will be a strong wind which will make it feel even colder, more like we are sitting down at minus three to minus four degrees. Tonight we will hold on to milder conditions. Rain will move south through Scotland and Northern Ireland. A cloudy night across England and Wales. Temperatures starting the day around five to six degrees, there will be signs of colder air moving through Scotland and Northern Ireland. Increasingly we could see snow to the north-west corner. We have rain to clear away from the south-east taking us into the afternoon before it does so. For many southern counties of England tomorrow afternoon is looking dry with bright, even some sunny spells. Temperatures around four to five degrees across the Midlands. The showers getting going further north across northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland. We have some frequent snow showers being driven in by a strong north-westerly wind. Temperatures sitting just above freezing. Those snow showers persisting into the evening. It will start to settle even to lower levels. The snow will be blown around by the strong winds. There is the potential for some disruption. We are most concerned about parts of northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Really worth keeping an eye on the detail of the bmmu keeping an eye on the detail of the forecast as the snow showers develop. Some with us on Thursday, scattered around, not everyone is seeing them. A few creeping further southin seeing them. A few creeping further south in between the showers thereby a little bit of sunshine. All of us will have struggling temperatures. It will be feeling colder than that with the strong north-westerly wind. The wintry weather continues into the weekend. Thank you very much. Now for more on our top story - the 70th anniversary of Thank you very much. There were 300 survivors here at Auschwitz today. Some of them had returned for the very first time since 1945 A decade ago there were 1,500 at the 60th anniversary there will be inevitably be far fewer in the years ahead, making it even more important to listen to the testimony of the few who will be with us. There be will a special programme on BBC Two at 7.00 testimony to mark Holocaust Day. We will leave you with some of the day’s images here from Auschwitz-Birkenau. Goodbye. We survivors continually came face-to-face with death. Tonight on BBC London News: The main suspect in the Alice Gross murder investigation: New CCTV links the Latvian builder to the schoolgirl’s killing.

From big screen to the London’s gauge, actor Mark Strong talks about being honoured for his latest role -- Mark Strong talks about being honoured for his latest role -- the London stage. Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. Detectives investigating the killing of schoolgirl Alice Gross have released new evidence linking their main suspect to her murder. Evidence which would have seen Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns charged, had he not killed himself. Detectives say his ""most likely motive was sexual"". 14-year-old Alice’s body was found in the River Brent in West London in September, a month after she went missing. The body of Zalkalns was discovered in woodland four days later, as Nick Beake reports. Laughing and joking as he buys beer. It isjust hours after he is believed to have murdered Alice Gross. This is newly released CCTV footage of the Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns. The Metropolitan Police said today that all the evidence they have gathered points firmly to him being the killer. Music was 14-year-old Alice’s passion. The month-long search for her was the biggest police inquiry since the 7/7 attacks. But Scotland Yard now say she was probably dead before she was even reported missing. Her naked body was found in the River Brent, wrapped in bin bags and weighed down with a bicycle wheel and bricks. A couple of feet away, a cigarette butt was recovered. Arnis Zalkalns’s DNA was on it. It was also on Alice’s shoes, and her iPhone cover was discovered under Arnis Zalkalns’s patio. And that leads us to the conclusions today that we are able to publicise. That is that Arnis Zalkalns was responsible for the murder of Alice Gross. We have had an investigation, our evidence, assessed by the Crown Prosecution Service. And it is their conclusions that, were Arnis Zalkalns alive today, that they would authorise a charge for murder of Alice. Today, police revealed more details about their murder investigation. On August 28th last summer, at 3:45pm, Alice is seen on CCTV crossing Brentford Lock. 15 minutes later, Arnis Zalkalns is seen cycling in the same direction. It is in the next hour that he is believed to have killed her. At 5:49pm, he emerges from the footpath on Hanwell Bridge. A few hours later, he is buying beer, before cycling back on a different bike to the murder scene. He returns two more times over the next 24 hours. The Metropolitan Police revealed today that after Alic’s body was discovered here, a postmortem examination showed that she had died ",,

A night-time vigil at Auschwitz on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp where more than a million people were murdered. Tonight the world is urged to remember all victims of the Holocaust, hundreds of whom were at today’s commemoration here in southern Poland. a million people were murdered. Tonight the world is urged to remember all victims in southern Poland. The ceremony was held on the site of the former concentration camp. Survivors were joined by world leaders, with B ITIESSBQE TOT gâI’IâI’8lioI’IS to COITIE. We speak to one of the survivors, who was a young girl at Auschwitz,-- about the importance of informing and warning every new generation. It’s so important for the young people to hear survivors still and see their numbers and know that it really has happened. Also tonight on the programme: Mixed news on the economy - the fastest annual growth in seven years but now it appears to be slowing. The murder of former spy, Alexander Litvinenko in London - As militants attack a hotel used by foreigners in Libya’s capital, killing at least five people, we have a special report four years after Gaddafi was toppled, on a country now in the hands of militias. And Chelsea and Liverpool are battling it out This was less about ideology, and more about the struggles of power. 70 years ago today the Soviet army entered this camp and liberated the few thousand survivors had had been left behind. Vast majority were jews and today some survived have returned in the So it was today more than it 300 survivors gathered through the gate, through which so many passed on their way to death. A huge tent protected them from the cold. As the burden of memory unfolded. Human skeletons, just skin and bones, but still alive. skeletons, just skin and bones, but stillalive. How still alive. How can I everforget the smell of burning flesh that permeated the That this tradition must embrace puralism and tolerance. In a Europe where jews faced attack in recent weeks from Islamic extremists, the continent’s politicians listened. Among them Germany’s President. The dead of Auschwitz were burned in creme tore ya or pits. Filmed here after the Soviets liberated the camp. One night, when theyjust took all the gypsies... Angela’s father was among the anonymous dead. Today, she came back for the first time with her daughter, Katie, to pay tribute to her father, in the camp where she herself was born. This is mY where she herself was born. This is my father’s place. This is where he died. I never knew he was a lawyer and he couldn’t take the physical work, so he died the first week. I have no grandparents except my grandmother. No cousins, no aunts, no uncles, nobody. It’s very hard to see. Many children were killed with their mothers shortly after arriving. Angela’s mother was spared because the doctor wanted to experiment on pregnant women. His innocent victims were photographed. Angela escaped because her mother hid her. She told me - Angela escaped because her mother hid her. She told me - not to come here. I told you, I don’t want memories, but it’s OK now. Tonight the living walked in the footsteps of the dead. Survivors carrying light into the darkest corners of memory. As you walk around the site here at Auschwitz, it is impossible to comprehend the immense numbers of the Holocaust - more than 6 million murdered, 1.5 million children among them. Perhaps the best known is Anne Frank, whose diary was published in 1947. She and her family were brought here in 1944. Herfather, Otto, survived the war and remarried. His second wife, and her daughter, Eva, were also survivors of Auschwitz. Eva is now 85 and has spent decades taking her message to schools, colleges, societies, and into prisons. I spoke to her about the day Auschwitz was liberated. Everything was frozen. It was one of the coldest winters on record. We had to hack ice to get water. There was a pond out there. We could have gone out but we didn’t dare to and we were actually very weak. One day a whole load of Russians, with horses, with guns, and a field kitchen. And put it up for us there. And fed us with cabbage soup. Which was wonderful, the smell already drove us mad but, you know, our bodies couldn’t digest and it went straight through. In the morning many people had died. Eva lost both her father and brother at Auschwitz. Her mother survived. It took Eva 40 years to be able to talk about her suffering and her loss. About Auschwitz I got over but the loss I never did and as well, you know in Auschwitz I had hope and I never gave up but after the war, when I realised that life would never get back to what I’d expected and hoped for, I became very, very depressed. I used to be as a child in Vienna, very sporty, very outgoing, many friends. We had a lovely life in Vienna, you know we went skiing in the winter, in the summer we went to the lake mountaining with my father. Suddenly all this was gone, so I was very bitter and it took me a long, long time to get over this. And this is your mother’s passport. Which is really quite interesting because we were Austrians. We didn’t really want to be Germans at all but when the Nazis came in, we lost our Austrian nationality. We had to become Germans and then they put aj on every jewish passport and as well, every jewish women, with such an ordinary name had to be called Sarah, every jewish boy and man had to be called Israel next to their own name. That’s Otto in front of Anne Frank’s house. Eva’s stepfather was Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank. He and Eva’s mother spent decades safeguarding Anne’s legacy, mainly her diary and that duty has been fully embraced by Eva Schloss. When we are not there to prove what happened, there will be more people coming up with saying it is just exaggeration and it never happened and so on and that’s why it is so important for young people to hear survivors still and see their number and know that it really has happened. That was Eva talking to me. Fergal Keaneis That was Eva talking to me. Fergal Keane is with me. They are all aware thatit Keane is with me. They are all aware that it was Auschwitz, the Nazi death camps that forced world leaders to introduce genocide legislation and outlaw crimes against humanity. People here were keenly aware that over the last 70 years, again and again the world has failed to do that, in Rwanda, Bosnia, many places. In a modern world that’s polarised. I think that’s what added urgency to the pleas of people like Roman Kent who said - it is not good enough to say Not every part of the economy is showing that sustainable growth. In the fourth quarter of last year, the economy grew by o 0.5% as a whole. Slower than the two previous quarters. Break down the figures and the recovery’s heavily waited to services, up 0.8%. While production, from manufacturing to energy and water, was down 0.1%. Crucial numbers like those on how the economy’s growing can be spun either way. Clearly, there is momentum in the British recovery. You see that, notjust in the GDP data, but the fact that jobs are being created all around the country. Indeed, one of the exciting things about this recovery at the moment is that you’re seeing job creation faster, for example, in the north of England than the south. Living standards are down compared to the last election for most people in work. Now we know the economy is slowing again, construction down, manufacturing flat, this isn’t good enough. Part of Labour’s plan is to train 125,000 new apprentices. Thousands of young people have already been trained up under the Coalition Government, like Robyn Gray whose apprenticeship laid to well-paid job. I had £10,000 increase to come here. So it’s mid 20s at the moment. In this place, it’s just starting off for me and it’ll only go up, hopefully! Today, the Conservatives promised far more apprentices than Labour, three million of them, paid for them by a reduction in the benefit cap. The economic engine may be cooling down, but the political battle is heating up. Andy Verity, BBC News. The Labour Leader, Ed Miliband, has said the health service needs to be rescued from what he called ""a creeping fragmentation and privatisation"" under the coalition. In a speech in Manchester, he set out a 10-year plan to invest more in the NHS in England. But the Conservatives accused Labour of making unfunded spending commitments. Here’s our health editor, Hugh Pym. They want to make it the major issue of the election campaign and the Labour Leader and Shadow Health Secretary have been setting out their big idea - integrating health and social care. If elected, Labour want to raise NHS spending, but there’s no such pledge for social care. Ed Miliband told me in the long term his plans could save money. If we keep elderly people in their home for longer, we can do something about the1 million bed days that are currently being lost with elderly people in hospital who don’t need to be there. But if you won’t make a promise to increase social care funding, how can people believe that you can deliver all this? It is deliverable and it is going to be delivered. All of our plans are credible, funded and costed. Labour’s plan include 5,000 home care workers, a new role within the NHS, help for GPs to identify the vulnerable elderly and a pledge to end the 15-minute restriction on some home care visits. Good morning, Greenwich co-ordinated care, Sue speaking. Health and social care cooperation is already under way in some areas, encouraged by the Government. Kelly has depression and mobility problems. She has one point of contact on the phone for all her health and housing needs, thanks to a pioneering scheme in Greenwich in south-east London. I’m getting better, slowly. I mean, it takes time but I know they’re there for me. And if I have any problems, Ijust ring them. Labour also want to increase training places for nurses in England, with an extra 2,000 a year, above the current level of 19,000. But the Conservatives accuse Labour of making unfunded spending commitments. What the NHS needs is stability, a Government that can continue to deliver increases in NHS spending on the back of a strong economy and that’s what this Government is doing. There was also criticism from inside Labour’s ranks. The former Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, who served under Tony Blair, suggested the current position on health was too cautious and more radical reform ideas were needed. It’s unlikely he speaks for many in the party, but the fact he made his comments on the day the health plan was launched, was hardly going to be helpful to the leadership. Hugh Pym, BBC News, Westminster. The new left-wing government in Greece has emphasised its intention to seek a renegotiation of its debts by appointing an outspoken critic of the international bailout as the country’s new Finance Minister. Yanis Varoufakis - who was sworn in this afternoon, along with the rest of the new cabinet - has previously described the repayments Greece has to make as ""fiscal waterboarding."" A lawyer for the family of the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, has told a public inquiry that his murder, eight years ago, was an act of ""nuclear terrorism"" by Russia on the streets of London. Litvinenko died after drinking tea, laced with radioactive polonium, while meeting two Russians in London. Moscow has refused to extradite the men, both of whom deny any involvement. Our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, has more. Marina Litvinenko arrived at court looking for answers. Eight years on the question remains, who was behind the death of her husband? Her lawyer today made clear who he thought was to blame. The trail of polonium traces leads notjust The trail of polonium traces leads not just from notjust from London to Moscow, but directly to the door of Vladimir Putin’s office. Andrei Lugovoi is one of two men accused of carrying out the killing. Both deny it. He made three trips to London each time carrying radioactive polonium. The first was October 16th, to 18th. It emerged that Alexander Litvinenko may have been poisoned at an office but at a low level so he thought it was food poisoning. The second was 25th-28th and it seemed there was not a chance to deliver the polonium. On the third visit, the fatal dose is believed to have been slipped into a cup of tea. That happened here at the Millennium Hotel where Alexander The inquiry heard thousands of people could have been at risk from the attacks. He fell ill that evening and died slowly over the next three weeks. We heard today that Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun would be invited to give evidence to the inquiry, but via videolink from Moscow and not in person. Both men would be arrested if they returned to London. Dmitry Kovtun was said today to have asked a contact if he knew a cook in London. Mr Kovtun said that he had a very expensive poison and that he needed the cook to put the poison in Mr Litvinenko’s food or drink. The secrets of this former Russian spy’s life-and-death are now being revealed. Corinthia Hotel, BBC News. In Libya, gunmen have stormed a luxury hotel in the capital, Tripoli. Local security officials say nine people were killed - five of them foreigners, including an American and a French citizen. The attackers set off a car bomb outside the Corinthia Hotel, and then went inside. Details aren’t clear, but reports say the siege ended with the gunmen blowing themselves up. A militant group linked to the Islamic State insurgents has claimed responsibility. Well, instability and violence have been rife in Libya since Colonel Gaddafi was ousted in 2011, in an uprising backed by NATO. Our international correspondent, Ian Pannell, along with cameraman Fred Scott, has travelled to Tripoli and sent this special report on a country now in the hands of militias. Colonel Gaddafi vowed to hunt his enemies, alley by alley, house by house. Four years on, the dictator’s dead and the streets of Tripoli have a veneer of normality, but many are, once again, living with suspicion and fear. Welcome to what remains of Tripoli International Airport. Rivalry between the so-called guardians of the revolution’ turned to hostility here. This wasn’t just a fight for control, but a deliberate attempt to raze it to the ground, part of a battle for key resources. By the time the fighting ended, Libya had two governments and parliaments, each backed by a loose alliance of militias. When the second battle for the future of Libya erupted, it was the militias of the revolution who turned their guns on each other and the fighting’s continued to this day. As the destruction here at the airport shows, this was less about ideology than a struggle for power and the spoils of war. Most of the battles are localised, over land, transport and, above all, oil. But the instability has allowed Islamists to prosper. These men support the rival government in Tripoli, led by a veteran of the Afghan war, whose group used to work alongside Al-Qaeda. The internationally recognised government says they’re terrorists. TRANSLATION: We fight for Sharia law. We need to build an Islamic State. We defend our religion, our people and our land. We’re not terrorists. We’re not in love with blood or killing. We’re calling for a state ofjustice and law and Islam, and everyone equal in the eyes of the law. But many fear the self-appointed militias who enforce that law. Opposition voices have been silenced, journalists threatened, politicians kidnapped. The Nawasi brigade control the midnight streets of Tripoli, accused of using excessive force. They’re trying to recast themselves as moderates. Now helping to catch drug dealers, drunk drivers and thieves. Their spokesman denies they’re hardliners, allied with Islamic militants. He says they’re simply helping a weak police force impose security. But at what cost? Freedom has become a relative concept in the new Libya. We got access to the prison, home to nearly 700 inmates. Most here are accused of crimes like robbery, drugs and murder. But some cells are reserved for so-called political crimes. TRANSLATION: I’m here because I was accused of being against the revolution and we support Gaddafi. When we were first brought here, we were tortured. There’s no freedom of speech. Even talking to you, God knows what’ll happen to me, but I have to tell the truth. Once again, public dissent is being silenced in Libya. And, once again, Martyrs’ Square is used to parade the power of Tripoli’s masters. This doesn’t feel like a takeover by Islamist radicals, more a complex battle between competing local interests. Libya’s revolution hasn’t stopped turning and the longer it spins, the more it risks dragging the country into greater violence and chaos, leaving those who risked everything for a better future, with songs and slogans, and unfulfilled dreams.

Tonight on BBC London News: New evidence linking a Latvian builder to the death of a schoolgirl. Lu kasz Lukasz Zaluskawas responsible for the murder of Alice Gross. Also tonight: The Mayor presses ahead with controversial plans to transform Embankment for cyclists. Now fighting with Islamic State in Syria but how did this footballer, who was a catholic, end up there? Plus, a cold snap is on its way. Your local and national weather’s coming up. Good evening. Detectives investigating the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross have released new evidence linking their main suspect to her murder. They say Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns would have been charged had he not killed himself. Alice’s body was found in the River Brent in west London last September. Nick Beake reports. ~ I Laughing and joking as he buys beer. It isjust hours after he’s believed to have murdered Alice Gross. This is newly-released CCTV footage of the Latvian builder, Lukasz Zaluska, the Metropolitan Police said today all the evidence they’ve gathered points firmly to him being the killer. Music was 14-year-old’s Alice’s passion. The month-long search for her was the biggest police inquiry since the 7/7 attacks. But Scotland Yard now say she was probably dead before she was even reported missing. Her naked body was found in the river Brent, wrapped in bin bags and weighed down by a bicycle wheel and bricks. A couple of feet away a cigarette butt was recovered. His DNA was on it, it was also on her shoes and her iPhone cover was discovered under Zaluska’s patio. That leads us to the conclusions we are able to publicise that Lukasz Zaluskawas responsible for the murder of Alice Gross. We have had our evidence assessed by the Crown Prosecution Service. And it is their conclusions that where Lukasz Z-- Z -- Zalkalns. At 5.49, he emerges from the football on Hanwell bridge. A few hours later he is buying beer before cycling back on a different bike to the murder scene. He returns two more times over the next 24 hours. The Metropolitan Police revealed today that after Alice’s body was discovered here a postmortem investigation showed she died from compression of the chest. Detectives said there was no sign of a sexual assault, but they believed the probably motive for her murder was one of a sexual nature. Aras Zalkans had served time for murdering his wife in Latvia but arrived in the UK legally. Serious questions need to be answered about what the authorities knew or should have known about him. Embankment, one of the capital’s busiest thoroughfares is to be transformed to make it safer for cyclists. The plans have been opposed by some business groups - so today the Mayor announced a few small concessions. Our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards is on the Embankment. This is where the cycle superhighway is going to G it’ll separate cyclists from other vehicles. Campaigners say today it was a really big victory for cycling in the capital. It is one of the capital’s most famous and important thorough fares and today, after a long consultation, the mayor has decided to push on with his flagship cycle lane, along embankment. People want safer cycling, and we are determined to do it. We can’t pretend that there won’t be impact on the road network that’s absolutely right. Somejourneys on the road network that’s absolutely right. Some journeys will be faster, some will be a little bit slower. Obviously we work very hard to minimise those impacts but sometimes a great city has got to do some difficult things in order to have the kind of radical change that people want to see. The segregated cycle superhighway will run from west London through Hyde Park along embankment to tower hill. But it has been contentious. Some say by taking out a lane for motor traffic, it will create more congestion. Others say it will mean safer cycling. It will definitely be a lot better. Because at the moment, you have got the lane marked off all the way from Stratford, but it is not actually segregated. So lorries are going in and out, cars, taxis, motorbikes. So, basically, you might as will not have a cycle lane. If they go ahead with this it is going to be horrendous. It will clog the city up and everything. There have been some changes made to this scheme. In three locations, the width of the cycle lane will be reduced from four metres down to three meters. That means they will be able to keep three other lanes for other traffic. City Hall says that will reduce the extra journey time, if you are going along the whole of the route, from 16 minutes down to six. It is an absolutely massive day for cycling in London. It means that the Mayor is finally making cycle is normal. It will be like getting on the bus or taking the tube. Black cab groups though now say they will seek a judicial review. They believe the process has been flawed. Other business groups also have concerns, and say it is in the wrong place. What we are asking for now is that Transport for London trial these changes. They should trial the route, put in temporary segregation, change some of the traffic lights. That’s actually see how this works in practice, before we spend £100 million pouring the concrete and putting it in permanently. City Hall says it is confident it would defeat any challenge in court. And campaigners say this decision is momentous for cycling in the capital. This still has to be ratified by the board, but construction could start as soon is April. What campaigners are saying is that if this can All the parties on the London Assembly have backed this scheme. But it is notjust about London, it is the whole of the country. This is what Chris Boardman said, ""I would like to see this innovative thinking of cycling happening in other major cities across Britain."" That legal challenge could still scupper this scheme. Many thanks. A football coach from south London has told this programme of his shock that a boy he once mentored has gone to Syria to join the terror group Islamic State. The footballer was one of five Portuguese men who apparently adopted extremist views after arriving in East London. Katharine Carpenter has the story. This football coach still finds these pictures hard to take in. This man is posing as a fighter in the Islamic state in Syria. But he’s remembered as a talented young striker whojoined the remembered as a talented young striker who joined the south striker whojoined the south London team two years ago. I’m shocked. If someone can get to Fabio who was focussed on becoming a footballer, to this, well that means anyone could be targeted, couldn’t they? It’s quite clear. He came here, absolutely focussed on playing professional football. According to a Portugese journalist who has been tracking their movement, Fabio was one of a group of five friends aged between 22-36 who travelled to east London to Portugal to work or study. Their pictures, which the BBC has not been able to identify independently, are taken from social media. This Portugese cafe in Leytonstone was one of the places where the men would meet up. They shared a passion for football and would come and watch the poer tu geese league on television. Elsewhere, something more was happening. It is unclear how or why but the men were apparently turning their backs on their Catholic upbringings to become radical Islamists Which find converts to Islam are very often the most vulnerable to Islamist extremism and radicalisation. They are receiving all information about their faith from one channel. Here another of the boys urges others to take up jihad and there’s speculation the group could have links to the terrorist with a London accent known asjihadi john. The Home Office and Metropolitan Police said they won’tp comment on security issues but those close to the group say they feel certain they willville influenced others in east London who are preparing to follow in their footsteps. All this week in our special series Frontline NHS - were looking at the pressure facing the capital’s health professionals. Today the focus is on the London Ambulance Service which says it’s having its busiest winter ever. Our correspondent Karl Mercer has been speaking to paramedics and Ambulance staff. Are you with her now? Sir, listen to my questions and we will get the correct help as soon as possible. OK, so now how do you feel with your breathing? They are taking more calls than ever in their history. And they are responding to more calls than ever. At the moment, she just said she has fallen off her scooter. I haven’t got any more information. Liam has been a paramedic for four years. It is a job that comes with its daily frustrations. We have actuallyjust been cancelled. But the next job is only minutes away. We are off to... I haven’t got much details yet. He just says chest pain at the moment. He is pleased to see us. It probably wasn’t an emergency. But for him, he obviously felt like he was very unwell earlier. I’m not sure why he waited five days to call us. But, that is what happens. On its busiest days, London’s Ambulance Service is taking more than 6000 calls. Managing demand is hard. Managing expectations can be just as difficult. You just never know what is going to happen next. Sometimes you answer the phone and you have got somebody who has cut theirfinger, and you are thinking, we haven’t got time for this. But then sometimes you take the next call and it is someone who has found their friend not breathing. You just don’t know what you’re going to get next. Quite often, you do get people speaking to you The control room in Waterloo now has an extra layer of nurses and paramedics, offering advice to their colleagues and to patients. The aim is to send ambulances only to those who need them most. Not everybody wants to do it, and it is difficult. It is hard work because you haven’t got the cues of being on the scene and looking at somebody. So, it is hard work. The service at the moment is missing response times. But, undera pilot scheme, will be given longer to assess if an ambulance should be sent. The winter rush may have gone, but this is a service still under pressure, short of around 400 paramedics and recruiting hard. But also trying to find new ways of working with what it has. And tomorrow we will be hearing frb frontline workers in Accident & Emergency. I’ll wish you a good night. And now over to Georgina for a look at the weather. What is happening with the coldsnap? On its way tomorrow. We’ll continue with the cloudy picture, light patchy rain. Sunny conditions in the afternoon. But much, much colder and feeling pretty raw in the strengthening winds as well. So, Wednesday, into Thursday, we could possibly see some snowshowers. Brighter conditions in between, slightly warming on Friday, sleety rain more than anything but still bright. Very, very cold but windy as well. Let’s look at the outlook. You can see the temperatures rising as the winds - falling as the winds Good evening, the whole of the UK is set to see a big change in the weather pattern over the next 24 hours. Today, cloudy with a nine degrees but by Thursday, cold air spreading south, and we will see temperatures ofjust three. That’s only half the story, it’ll be exceptionally windy. It’ll feel more like we are sitting below freezing. Now the changes are all due to some weather fronts which are currently at the north-west of the UK. The first one bringing rain. It’s behind the second front that we’ll see that colder air starting to develop. Through the early hours, inceasingingly some sleet and some snow across parts of north-west Scotland, but certainly to start Wednesday morning, still temperatures five or six degrees for England and Wales. It is cloudy, damp. We have patchy rain and through the morning, that will be clearing its way south and eastwards. So by 3.00pm, southern areas dry with bright or sunny spells, although falling temperatures. Fourto spells, although falling temperatures. Four to five in East Anglia, through the Midlands and into Wales. Further north, into the cold air, increasingly sleet showers on the coast but inland areas, some snow showers to lower levels, combined with the winds gusting to around 50 miles per hour at times. There is the potential for snow to get blown around with blizzards. Well be showers gathering pace through the evening. Especially across parts of Northern Ireland, through the central belt of Scotland, spreading their way south into northern England. A few majors crop up further south but as is the nature with showers, the detail is going to prove very difficult. Some places may miss them altogether. But certainly the potential for some disruption as we look through Wednesday night and into Thursday. Temperatures starting the day around about freezing, and the Met Office have some warnings in I force. At this stage we are mostly concerned with northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. But that’s not to say there is the risk of snow further south. Worth keeping tuned to the forecast or BBC local radio. On Thursday, a scattering of snow showers, by the afternoon, mainly convined to northern It’s a good idea is this, giving us all a psychiatric test. You want them mad, but not too mad.

The main thing... I can honestly say, hand on heart, I would only punch Chris Akabusi if he started it. Well, that’s good, isn’t it? So, I do hope that’s set your mind at rest on the Akabusi front. Absolutely. Mind you, that is a bit of a coup getting him on board. How did you manage that? No, he’s not... And why does he have a problem with me? What have I ever done to him? I’ve never even met the man! If you ask me, it’s him you should be having a word with, going round, saying that. Let’s try some word association, shall we?

SINGS LONG HIGH NOTE Shut the front door! # Everybody’s SINGS LOW # Looking for something. # Good evening. Germany has said it will resist attempts to allow Greece to write off some of its huge debts. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said billions had already been written off by private creditors, and that Greece should continue its programme of cuts. The country’s newly-elected left-wing Syriza party wants to halve the amount it owes, and it’s already started easing austerity measures. From Athens, Mark Lowen reports. Across Europe, the flames of protest were lit by the same spark, rising unemployment. From Athens, to the streets of Madrid. To the furious scenes in Rome. A continent that once spelt hope is now marked by fear of the future. And today, a stark warning from the EU’s Finance Commissioner that, without change, the European dream will collapse. If Europe doesn’t deliver on growth and jobs, if Europe is seen as the place for austerity. If Europe is not seen as a hope and progress, but as a constraint, a punishment, a pain. Then the European project will not only be criticised, but rejected. It is a message that chimes with the new Greek prime minister. Alexis Tsipras is a fresh face, with a fresh approach. An EU member with the highest jobless rate, he says no more austerity, and that the Eurozone must forgive part of Greece’s debt. But Europe’s Paymaster General is not moved. Chancellor Angela Merkel telling a German newspaper this today. But, for those like Theodora, the endless cuts have led Greece to ruin. Multilingual and highly educated, she has been unable to find work since the crisis hit. Austerity hindering the green shoots of growth. I am living on my savings, and odd jobs, which means that there are many things I cannot do that I used to do before. I used to go to the cinema, the theatre, buy books. It is not that I can’t get the job, it is that the job does not even exist. The Tsipras effect is spreading. In Madrid today, tens of thousands rallied for Podemos, the leftists leading the polls there. They too vow an end to cuts, and could prove a vital ally for the Greek new leader after elections this year. Alexis Tsipras says the outlook for Greece and Europe will remain bleak unless it radically changes course. Now, a sign from Brussels that his message might be gaining powerful pro-austerity voice. It will be a head on battle. A British military health care worker has been brought back to England to be monitored for signs of Ebola, after being injured with a needle in Sierra Leone. The individual, who had been treating someone at the time, is being assessed at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Caroline Hawley is there. What more can you tell us? The medic has not been identified but we know they were one of some 80 British military personnel working at a treatment centre in Sierra Leone built by the British Army. We do not know exactly what happened, how this accident happened, but we do know they were caring for and Ebola patient at the time so there is a significant risk. They were brought back here very quickly, thrown back by the RAF, before there was any risk of contagion. They were not showing any symptoms. They are being closely monitored with blood tests. This is the hospital with a specialist isolation unit which treated Pauline Cafferkey and Will Pooley. If the medic does all six, they will have the very best care here. -- sick. All rank and file police officers in England and Wales should be armed with a taser because of the heightened security threat. That’s the message from the head of their union, the Police Federation. Steve White said acts of terrorism could be carried out anywhere, and that police needed to be protected. Critics say there’s no evidence that tasers would work as a deterrent. Andy Moore’s report contains some flash photography. At the moment, only 10% of police officers are trained to fire taser guns, but the Police Federation said any front-line police officer who wants to should be allowed to carry one. There was a recent survey in the south of England that showed 87% of officers felt they ought to have a taser. We have been calling for this for some time. The increase in threat level to police officers means the time for action is now. That increased threat comes from terrorists such as those in Belgium who were planning to kill police officers before their plot was foiled. The use of taser guns has tripled in recent years. 10,000 in 2013. Mostly the Taser gun is used as a deterrent, Each individual police force decides its own policy on the use of Taser QUFIS. The routine arming police officers would take a collective change of opinion by Chief Constables up and down the country and, at the moment, there is no sign of that. An individual taser costs around £1,000, and there is the cost of training. The Association of Chief Police Officers says it supports the wider use of tasers, but does not want to training to be diluted. Others oppose any change. We can see a role for taser guns in modern policing, if the police are adequately trained to the same standard as a firearms officer. But we’re very worried that this proposed massive rollout will not be backed by proper training, and indeed would a taser really combat a determined terrorist? The Police Federation will vote on the issue next month. The views of rank-and-file police officers will no doubt be taken into account, but they don’t make policy. Well-wishers have donated more than £135,000 for a disabled pensioner who was mugged outside his home in Gateshead. Alan Barnes, who’s 67, was attacked last Sunday. Mr Barnes, who’s just lift 6in tall, and is visually impaired, broke his collarbone when he was pushed to the ground. Katie Cutler, who set up the fundraising page with an original target of £500, said she couldn’t believe the amount of money that’s been raised. I am lost for words. When I am speaking to my friends, I think, my goodness, it doesn’t feel real. I am so over the moon. Tennis: Serena Williams has won the Australian Open, beating Maria Sharapova today in straight sets. It’s the sixth time she’s taken the title, and the 19th Grand Slam of her career. Tomorrow morning, all eyes will be on Britain’s Andy Murray when he takes on Novak Djokovic in the final. Ben Smith reports. This was Selina Williams, as we have rarely seen her before, jumping forjoy, leaping ever closer to tennis history. This sixth Australian Open title takes Williams beyond many of the great names of the past. Martina Navratilova among them. Standing here with 19 championships is something I never thought would happen, you know. I went on the court with just a ball and a racket and a hope, and that’s all I had. This was a match bursting with thunderous hitting and deafening screams. A contest between two of the great champions. From the off, Williams dictated, setting the tone with a series of mighty blows. A fierce backhand wrapped up the first set in A7 minutes, Williams taking it 6-3. Facing a 16th straight defeat by the American, Maria Sharapova raised her game. The set went into a tie-break but, in the end, the Williams serve proved just too good. At 33, the clock is unquestionably ticking on her career, but for her rivals, it must feel like it is ticking all too slowly. Tomorrow morning, all eyes and camera lenses will be trained on Andy Murray, as he goes in search of a first Australian Open title against the mighty Novakjokovic. Murray knows he has it all to do. I’ve never won here. He has won here four times. He will go into the match being the favourite. If I was to win tomorrow, it would feel like a big upset. History suggests Djokovic should prevail but, if Murray and his camp can keep their cool, it could yet be another landmark day in British sporting history. In the last few minutes, it has been announced the actress Geraldine McEwan has died. She worked in theatre and starred in a number of films alongside Kenneth Williams and Sir Laurence Olivier. There’s more throughout the evening on the BBC News Channel. We are back with the late news at 10:10pm. Now, on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The Ethiopian authorities have broadcast a video of a man from Islington, who’ve they’ve been holding in secret, since he was kidnapped in Yemen lastjune. Ethiopia claim Andargachew Tsige is a terrorist, and sentenced him to death in absentia. But a series of emails has also raised questions about the actions of the Foreign Office in London. He looks very gaunt. In this latest recording of Andargachew Tsige, he claims he is healthy and well. But for his partner in north London, it provides little comfort. The writer and opposition activist has been imprisoned in Ethiopia for seven months now, arrested last year on his way to Eritrea while in transit in Yemen. Internal Foreign Office e-mails obtained by his family show the Government believes his arrest was a breach of international law, but so far they have failed to secure his release. For me, what it defines to be here and be part of the UK, it is fairness, afair and be part of the UK, it is fairness, a fair society. I do not think we are being treated fairly. This human rights lawyer says the video does not show the true story. He has not been provided with an independent medical doctor to assess his condition. We know he is in solitary confinement which is a form of torture and we fear he is being mistreated. All we have to go on ",,
152,BBC News 24,31-jan-2015,BBC Weekend News,22:10,20 mins,True,"A video is released online supposedly showing the beheading of Kenji Goto, the japanese hostage held by Islamic State. Mr Goto, a journalist and film-maker, went to Syria in October. It’s the second video of a beheading released by IS in less than a week. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, insists Greece must honour its debt- but the Greek leader wants half of it cancelled. Anti-austerity protests in Spain - as another new party in Europe - threatens the political establishment. Andy Murray’s confident- on the eve of the Australian Open Final. And Geraldine McEwan - the actress who played Miss Marple - has died at the age of 82. Good evening - the japanese government has strongly condemned Islamic State over a video supposedly showing the beheading of the hostage Kenji Goto. Mr Goto, a journalist, went to Syria in October. Earlier today, japanese officials said negotiations with Islamic State to free him had become deadlocked. Bothjapan and jordan had been trying to secure his release, along with that of a jordanian pilot, in return for the freeing of an al-Qaeda member held byjordan. Caroline Hawley’s report does not contain images from the video. Kenji Goto, married with two young children, apparently beheaded by the militant with the British accent who has already murdered other hostages. The video, which we are not showing, says the journalists journalist was killed because ofjapan’s support for the Alliance against IS. It said it would work with the international community to bring justice, a spokesman called it a deplorable act. Kenji Goto was last seen crossing into Syria in October and is thought to have been trying to negotiate the release of his friend, a self-starter military contractor Haqqani Carla. The first demand came on the 20th ofjanuary. For the two men IS wanted to hand in dollars. Within 72 hours. A day the deadline expired it released a video that appeared to show how Yukawa had been beheaded and it issued a new demand, not money but the release from a jordanianjail not money but the release from a jordanian jail of a female not money but the release from a jordanianjail of a female suicide bomber whose bomb had failed to go off-- 200 million dollars. In 2005 Sajida al-Rishawi made a televised confession with a device that did not detonate. She and her husband had targeted a wedding party, a banqueting hall full of people who had come to summer break. For her part in the plot she’s been on death row for almost a decade. jordan had agreed to free her in return for its captured pilot. What I can Alcazar spat had been on a bombing raid against IS but had to eject from his F-16 as it crashed. The jordanians had insisted on proof of life before they released Sajida al-Rishawi. None came. Injapan the public waited and hoped. They rallied in support of Kenji Goto as the crisis unfolded halfway across the world. His mother had appealed for his release. TRANSLATION: Dear Prime Minister, please save my son’s life. Kenji only has a little time left. Experts say the strategy of IS is to undermine. They will see it as a success. America has stated repeatedly it would never negotiate with Islamic state. It doesn’t recognise the Islamic state as a state or as Islamic and it would never sit down with Islamic State. jordan has already broken that principle and I think that creates at least the perception of division within the coalition. The japanese journalist and the jordanian pilot, their fates are linked in the most macabre of ways. His family still waits for news as Kenji Goto’s begins to mourn. In a moment we’ll speak to our Middle East Correspondent, Yolande Knell, who’s injordan - but first let’s go live to Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo. Rupert, strong words of condemnation from the government over what’s turned into a tragedy for the country. It has and the government this morning as it has all along throughout, has been saying it is doing its best and wanted to get Mr Goto out and was negotiating. If you look at what Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister, said this morning in the response, while condemning this killing, he has also said we will never give in to terrorism and we will hunt these people down. This is the language of the UK and the US in these sorts of situations and he’s very much putting himself in that group. He’s basically saying japan is going to remain tough, and in these instances it will not back down against a threat to its citizens. While it is very sad for the family and there will be consternation here at the conclusion to this drama I think Shinzo Abe, and the japanese government, are saying we are with the America and the UK and we will not give into the sort of demands. Given that this is the logical conclusion this crisis. Yolande, there’s no mention of the jordanian pilot in the IS video - concern about him must remain very high? That’s right. And it is surprising because the fate of these two men has been tied together in the latest messages that we have heard from Islamic State. I spent the last few hours with the family of Lieutenant Morata Alcazar spur. They said they had no new information about him but after this information came through they said they hoped to God he were still alive. Thejordanian still alive. The jordanian government has still alive. Thejordanian government has offered to exchange this Iraqi woman prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi for its pilot but that was not the deal that Islamic State offered. They only offered to spare the life of the pilot and perhaps exchange this one for Kenji Goto. This could all be a sign that he is a special bargaining chip for Islamic State, somebody they can use to put extra pressure on the international coalition fighting against them. Yolande Knell in a man and Rupert in Tokyo, thank you. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she won’t support cancelling any of Greece’s huge debt. Greece’s newly-elected government, led by the left-wing Syriza party, wants to halve the amount it owes, and it’s already started easing austerity measures. But Mrs Merkel said billions had already been written off by private creditors, and the programme of cuts should continue. From Athens, here’s our correspondent Mark Lowen. Europe’s newest leader has shaken the continent to its core. Alexis Tsipras is a fresh face with a fresh approach, reversing austerity and calling for a debt write-off. It’s a huge challenge to Europe’s economic policy but today Europe’s paymaster hit back. Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel told a newspaper she did not envisage fresh debt cancellation. ""Europe will continue to show solidarity with Greece,"" she said, ""as with other countries hard hit by the crisis if they carry out reforms and cost saving measures."" But it’s those measures that have fanned the flames of protest, from Athens to the streets of Madrid, to the furious scenes in Rome. A Europe that once spelt hope was overcome by fear of the future. And today a stark warning from Brussels that without change the European dream will collapse. If Europe doesn’t deliver on growth and jobs, if Europe is seen as the place for austerity, if Europe is not seen as a hope, as progress, but on the contrary, as punishment and pain, then the European project will be not only criticised but rejected. It’s a message that chimes with people like Theodora, multilingual and highly educated she’s been unable to find work since the crisis hit. Austerity hindering the green shoots of growth. I’m living on my savings and odd jobs. Which means that there are many things I cannot do that I used to do before. I used to go to the cinema, I used to go to the theatre, I used to buy books. It’s not that I can’t get the job, it’s that the job doesn’t even exist. Greece was the laboratory for Europe’s austerity. It’s being pushed back here. But tonight Alexs Tsipras is sounding conciliatory too, talking of a mutually beneficial agreement without conflict, allowing Greece to breathe. He knows he faces powerful opponents but he is radically shifting the debate. Mark Lowen, BBC News, Athens. Meanwhile in Spain, tens of thousands of people have marched through Madrid in the biggest show of support yet for the country’s own anti-austerity party, Podemos. The party, formed just a year ago, is hoping to emulate the success of Syriza. Our Madrid correspondent Tom Burridge was at the rally. At times today it felt like a rock concert. But this was a political rally of Spain’s new far left party. Look at the Greek flag. They feel inspired here. And some people crave change. I don’t know what Angela Merkel can possibly think about this. I just think she’s scared of change and I think change is constant This bus left Valencia at 5am in the morning tojoin the march. Podemos is a grass roots movement born out of Spain’s financial crisis. We are fed up with corruption, with inequality, with poverty, with misery and with the political measures of austerity that are killing our country. The party Podemos, whose name means ""we can"" said this was not a protest but a celebration. Like in Britain this is an election year in Spain and this far left party is now topping many of the opinion polls here. What this political party are successfully doing is tapping into a deep level of dissatisfaction with the traditional political class in Spain. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands, squeezed into this iconic square. To listen to their leader. Pablo Iglesias is a friend of Greece’s new Prime Minister. Whether or not his party wins at the end of this year, Spanish politics have already changed. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in Madrid. A British military healthcare worker has been brought back to England to be monitored for signs of Ebola - after being injured with a needle in Sierra Leone. The individual, who had been treating someone at the time, is being assessed at the Royal Free Hospital in London. disabled pensioner Alan Barnes, injured after being mugged outside his home in Gateshead, has now raised nearly £190,000.

We’ll start with today’s football in England and Scotland. Depending on where you are watching, Match of the Day or Sportscene follows the news but if you can’t wait that long and want the results now then here they come. There wasjust the one draw in the Premier League and that came at Stamford Bridge where Chelsea missed out on the chance to go eight points clear at the top of the table. Loic Remy gave them the lead before David Silva equalised. It finished 1-1 so City remain five points behind the leaders. Elsewhere, there were away wins for Everton and Newcastle - Daniel Sturridge scored on his return from injury for Liverpool as they beat West Ham 2-0. Manchester United beat bottom club Leicester 3-1 to go third. And there were wins for Stoke and Sunderland and Harry Kane scored twice for Spurs in a 3-0 win at West Brom. Dundee United are through to the Scottish League Cup final. Nadir Ciftci’s late goal knocked out holders Aberdeen. Celtic face Rangers in the other semi tomorrow, meanwhile all three games in the Scottish Premiership ended 1-1. Serena Williams has won the Australian Open for a sixth time - it’s her 19th Grand Slam Singles title. She beat Maria Sharapova in straight sets. This time tomorrow we’ll know if Andy Murray is the men’s champion, but he’ll be the underdog against Novak Djokovic. Ben Smith reports. In the frame, centrestage, all eyes will be on Andy Murray tomorrow morning as he attempts to win a first Australian open title. But the Scotis first Australian open title. But the Scot is well aware that Novak Djokovic is a truly formidable opponent. I’ve never won here and he’s won here four times. He will go into the match obviously being the favourite and if I was to win tomorrow it would feel like it would be a big upset. Djokovic has won both finals the men have contested in Australia and history would appear to suggest the Serb should prevail again but if Murray and his camp can keep their cool in the Melbourne heat it could yet be remembered as another landmark day in British boarding history. It was another look -- none of the sport’s greatest rivalries that contested the women’s final earlier in the day, Serena Williams against Maria Sharapova, world number one against world number two. The American dominated from the off, taking the first set 6-3 before serving her way to victory in a second set tie-break. Her sixth Australian open title took her to beyond many of the great names of the past. This was Serena Williams as we’ve rarely seen her before, leaping ever closer to tennis history. Ben Smith, BBC News. And that’s your sport tonight. Many thanks. The actress, Geraldine McEwan, best known for playing Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple, has died at the age of 82.

Miss Marple, is that correct? Yes, Inspector, correct. Precise and petite, Geraldine McEwan first appeared as Miss Marple on television in 2004. It was a role that introduced her to a new audience, many of whom were too young to remember her early successes. Born in Windsor she had no formal training but was acting in the local theatre by the age of 14 and soon starring in the West End. She appeared on stage with actors including Leslie Phillips and Laurence Olivier. She played a variety of roles on television. And won a BAFTA for her part as the mother in oranges are not the only fruit. Who is the oldest man in the Bible? How old was he when he died? 969. What kind of tea is this? Stand Up Be Counted.

That’s all from me, good night. Hello. It’s turning into another icy night out there and the we can still has some more snow in it. It’s coming down hard over the mountains of northern Scotland, the wind so strong we have blizzards and significant drifting snow and across other parts of eastern Scotland running down through eastern England as the night goes on, coastal rain, inland sleet and snow and snow showers for Northern Ireland and a few for Wales and the south-west and a bit more snow to come into the moors and other parts of southern and southeastern England in the night, some light snow, round one centimetre in places, so don’t be surprised if some of us wake up to a light covering in the morning. And snowy start in the morning, this is the picture at nine o’clock, still some snow showers in Scotland. The intensity easing gradually and a few showers for Northern Ireland and coastal parts of the West but for the bulk of Scotland, Wales and West of England there will be plenty of sunshine to greet us but plenty of cloud in central and eastern England and still some outbreaks of rain, sleet and snow. A keen wind particularly as it doesn’t clear until later in the day for easternmost parts and it will stay rather grey. Tomorrow is a fine day for many of us, some crisp winter sunshine doing nothing for the temperature. Mid to low single figures and the wind making it feel at or below freezing. But with lighter winds Reflections of 2014 will live long. Aberdeen lifted silverware, their first in 19 years. Dundee United could not mirror it.

Four teams and two semifinals and one trophy. To date for will become three as Dundee United tried to end Aberdeen’s reign as cup-holders. They will have to defeat the tangerine opponents at Hamden, something they have got yet to do. One of the best defences in the country against one of the best attacks, an afternoon of leaky cup intrigue will surely follow. The two meetings between the two teams this season so far, Dundee United with an impressive win in week one and Aberdeen had an oppressive victory in December. There is not much between them. Some big decisions made byjackie McNamara today. There is a baptism of fire for the new Aberdeen defender. Several players may feel aggrieved that they are on the bench today. Steven McLean took charge of the final last year when Aberdeen ended their weight for silverware. final last year when Aberdeen ended theirweight for silverware. Dundee their weight for silverware. Dundee United theirweight for silverware. Dundee United have just two defeats in their last 11. Aberdeen lost United on the opening day of the league season and they lost three of their opening five but they have lost just twice in the subsequent 19.

Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Fifty years ago today, Britain came to a standstill for the funeral of one of its greatest leaders, Winston Churchill. Churchill was the only commoner to receive a state funeral in the 20th century. Today, a ceremony is recreating the flotilla which carried his coffin along the River Thames from the Tower of London to Westminster Pier. This morning, David Cameron laid a wreath at a statue of Churchill and said he would be remembered not just as a great leader, but as a great Briton. Ben Brown is on HMS Belfast on the River Thames. Yes, half a century ago today, a proud and grateful nation stopped what it was doing to say a final farewell to Sir Winston Churchill. Half a century on, that state funeral, an extraordinary occasion which was watched on television by more than 350 million people around the world, that state funeral is being remembered and commemorated. This morning a special wreath laid by the British Legion to commemorate his life was brought from the Tower of London and placed on a port of London vessel which carried his coffin along the River Thames at his funeral. Today it recreated the journey in a flotilla. It went under Tower Bridge which was raised as a mark of respect for the life of Sir Winston Churchill. There was a 1+ gun salute from HMS Belfast as well. Duncan Kennedy has this report on the days events. The nation may have stopped mourning, but it never stopped remembering. 50 years after Winston Churchill’s funeral, the day of commemorations began with this simple ceremony I Tower Bridge. -- by Tower Bridge. A wreath which was carried by the vessel which once bore him on his finaljourney. It’s voyage down the Thames bore the coffin of a man who had helped to repel tyranny. The age defining image of lowering cranes became a metaphor for the country ‘s heads bowing in grief. Marching to the sound of the solemn funeral marches, one after another. Winston Churchill helped to set the course of British history and on this day 50 years ago the nation paid his respects. He may have been 90, but his death was a jolt, his funeral and historic punctuation mark. As wartime leader he ensured the country ‘s darkest hour did not become its Day of defeat. No wonder the many came to say goodbye. It was a wonderful, wonderful sendoff for him really. Ithink a wonderful, wonderful sendoff for him really. I think we were extremely proud. Of course we were sad and we had our memories. We were able to vary him privately at the end of the day. -- able to vary him privately at the end of the day. -- bury him. 1 million mourners stood. Half the population watched on television. Among them use real cameras caught this teenager at the back straining to see. That 17-year-old was Barry Barnes from Blackpool. He captured the day on his camera, from the fly past to the barge bearing Churchill’s body. It was a moment he will never forget. I think the mood matched the day, weather-wise. It was a dark and sombre day and it felt sombre and quiet. The crowd were respectful and silent. Someone else even closer that day was this army captain. The man in charge of his coffin. Everybody was very quiet and sombre. No one was talking like that. It was silent. And very peaceful. It was a very nice ending, actually. Accompanying the old warrior... For some people, his death was a book end to the British Empire. He remained an heroic figure. This morning the Prime Minister led tributes in the House of Commons. The place where Churchill’s soaring oratory had raised the nation ‘s morale. History has been kind to Winston Churchill. Not because he wrote it, but because he shaped it. He left a Britain more free, more secure, more brave, and more proud. For some, Winston Churchill was controversial and flawed. To most he was an inspiration and a saviour. Someone who remains one of those rare leaders remembered in life, death, and history. Well, on this 50th anniversary here along the River Thames, that vessel that carried his coffin of a century ago is still making itsjourney coffin of a century ago is still making its journey along the river, recreating what it did 50 years ago. Duncan Kennedy is on the flotilla now as it makes its progress. What is happening now? Well, an extraordinary sight in 2015. just as it was in 1965. A little bit of history is being recreated behind us today with this voyage of the Havengore down the River Thames. In just a few moments we will be pulling alongside Festival Hall for a small act of remembrance on board, there are members of his family there including his great-grandsonjack, Emma Soames, great-grandson jack, Emma Soames, his great-grandsonjack, Emma Soames, his granddaughter, and his other granddaughter Celia. They will pay tribute to a man using words such as, he was a great man, a leader and an inspirerof the as, he was a great man, a leader and an inspirer of the nation. The Havengore was chosen because of Churchill ‘s links with the world of all things nautical. He was naval secretary and set up the Port of London authority. Today that small journey of around 20 minutes has been recreated by those members of his family and also by war veterans. They are coming to this point on the Thames to pay their respects, their tributes to the man who many still believe was the greatest Englishman of the 20th century. Yes, Duncan, just talking to people who were at the state funeral 50 years ago, some say they were crying, they had tears streaming down their faces as they saw Sir Winston’s coffin being processed through the streets of London. For his grandchildren who are on that vessel that you just saw, they are remembering a grandfather they loved, the nation, though, remembering one of Britain’s greatest ever wartime leaders, greatest ever prime ministers. For many people one of the greatest Britons who ever lived. Back to you, Rita. Many thanks. There are signs the rise in the number of children who are overweight or obese may be starting to level off, at least in those who are under 10. A study of more than 370,000 children in England shows that1 in 3 is overweight. But it does suggest the rate of increase in obesity in younger children slowed dramatically in the ten years to 2013. Our Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. For more than a decade health experts have been trying to tackle the problem of a growing number of overweight or obese children. Now a new study suggests that efforts may be paying off, at least for some. Researchers looked at the medical records of children in England over a 20 year period to see if the childhood obesity picture was changing. They found that between 1994 and 2003 the proportion of obese and overweight children increased byjust over 8% each year. Over the next decade the rate of increase slowed substantially to just 0.4% per year. There were big differences between older and younger children. Among 11 to 15-year-olds, well over a third were obese or overweight. This increase in obesity that we are seeing is very concerning. Particularly because the largest increase has been amongst older children. And when older children are obese it is very likely they will go on to become obese adults. This is going to affect their prospects in terms of developing chronic conditions like type two diabetes. Obesity rates for children and adults in the UK are still among the highest in Europe. Health campaigners say there is no room for complacency. Unfortunately today’s report is only half the truth. Because the 15-year-olds are starting to become dangerously overweight, in fact. That has never been reported before. So the first time we have real figures for 15-year-olds, and that should be deeply concerning. The fact that obesity rates are levelling off might indicate messages on the benefits of healthy eating and lots of exercise are beginning to take hold. But it’s still a very mixed picture. And with so many older children putting on weight, no one is yet claiming victory in the fight against fat. South Africa has granted parole to the former commander of an apartheid-era death squad. Eugene de Kock confessed to carrying out more than a hundred murders and acts of torture and fraud, targeting opponents of the apartheid government. He’s spent more than 20 years in prison. Our Africa Correspondent Andrew Harding sent this report. In modern South Africa evil has always had a face. Eugene de Kock, the quiet policeman who confessed to killing and torturing dozens of black activists in the years before the end of racial apartheid. De Kock was sentenced to life in prison many times over, his nickname was primeval. 19 years on, is it time to forgive? In recent months the relatives of some of his victims have been to visit him injail. Sandra’s husband was killed by him in 1992 as part of a dirty tricks campaign to undermine South Africa’s transition to democracy. You think mY transition to democracy. You think my goodness, am I really face-to-face with this killer? When he said he was sorry you could really see it. He was notjust saying it because he wanted parole. You could really see it in his eyes, it was genuine. De Kock has been held at this Pretoria prison, now alongside Oscar Pistorius, and he has been helping investigators to find other bodies. Today the South African government declared that he had done enough to deserve his freedom. In the interests of nation-building and reconciliation I have decided to place Mr de Kock on parole. The timing of his release is being kept a secret because some people have not forgiven him and many more ask why did his bosses never face justice? As one man been made a scapegoat for the crimes of many? -- has one man? Of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, half lack the capability to investigate corruption among their own officers. That’s the conclusion of a study by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary. It found many forces don’t do enough to look for corruption, although it says most officers are honest and professional. Danny Shaw reports. Case unsolved - nobody has been brought to justice for the murder of Daniel Morgan, a private investigator killed in the car park of a south London pub 28 years ago. Scotland Yard has said police corruption was partly to blame for the failure of its initial inquiry into the murder. An independent panel is examining the case. But corruption allegations like that are unusual. The Inspectorate of Constabulary says corruption is not endemic. It says police have made great strides to tackle it, and there is strong leadership on the issue. But the report says too few forces are able to identify threats and take steps to catch corrupt officers. It says anti-corruption investigators are not conducting enough searches and drug tests on officers. As a result, police are missing opportunities to gather evidence, and when they do investigate, no action is taken in two-thirds of cases. The Inspectorate says that is a cause for concern. A corruption investigation is a covert crime investigation. That means access to specialist capabilities. Sometimes those capabilities, those powers, were not being used to the extent that we might have expected. The College of Policing says it is looking at ways to develop the counter-corruption training that it already provides to police forces. Senior officers say they will continue to improve their approach so that those who are not fit to be in the police are held to account and removed.

Everyone knows that the bodyclock plays an important role in our mood and wellbeing, but now a new study suggests our sporting performance is heavily influenced by it. Scientists from the University of Birmingham believe that being a ‘night owl’ or an early riser can affect performance levels by as much as 26 percent, depending on what time of day the activity takes place. It could have huge implications for elite athletes and for the rest of us, as Tim Muffett reports. Time is so important in so many sports. But perhaps even more than we thought. Emma and Amesh both compete for the University of Birmingham. Amesh is a night owl and prefers to get up late. Emma is the opposite. In the morning, I’m more alert. But if I do sport in the evening, it’s more of a drag. Our games are in the afternoon, but in the evening, I’m more alert, more proactive, and I feel more confident in my abilities. The way body clocks affect sporting performance has become the focus of an academic study with startling results. We were amazed to find peak performance differences up to 26% over the course of a day, which could be the difference between qualifying for the Olympics and winning a gold medal. Our lives are governed by our internal body clocks, or circadian cycle. Scientists monitored different athletes, some night owls, some morning larks, some neither, to see when they performed at their best. Previous reports suggested that an athlete’s best performance is likely to occur in the early evening, but this research suggests it’s more complicated than that. Someone who wakes up naturally at 7:00am may find their best performance occurs around six hours later, around 1:00pm. A late riser, someone who wakes up naturally at around 11:00am, who has a slower running bodyclock, may find their best sporting performance takes place at 10:00pm at night. What we found is that this peak performance happens a certain number of hours after the beginning of your biological day. The direct implication is that every individual has a different maximum performance time over the course of a day. What sort of time would you go to bed and would you get up? Bodyclocks alter with age. Students often find it hard to get up in the morning and it’s not necessarily their fault. But whatever your age, there are ways to help your body stay in sync. What many of us do is get up very early during the week for work, say six or seven o’clock in the morning, and then at the weekend, we all have lie-ins because we accumulate this sleep debt over the course of the week. And that difference in timing between when we wake up during the week and when we wake up at the weekend completely desynchronises your bodyclock. No more lie-ins at the weekend? You’d probably feel better if you woke up at the same time. When you go back to Monday, you’ll feel better during those Monday blues. Given that our circadian cycle rules our lives, maybe all of us, notjust athletes, should pay more attention to the clock inside of us. In the last few minutes, four men who attacked a university lecturer have been sentenced. Two men were jailed for 19, years, have been sentenced. Two men were jailed for19, years, and jailed for 19, years, and two, for 17 years. Paul Kohler suffered a fractured eye socket, a fracture to his left jawbone and a broken nose when the gang entered his home in Wimbledon last August. Our correspondent Keith Doyle is at Kingston Crown Court. What was said in court? This was a ruthless and savage attack on the manner and his family -- ruthless and savage attack on the manner and his family -- on the man. He answered the door to four men who burst into the house and two of them beat him around the head and kicked him. He was left the court heard, utterly unrecognisable, one of the men he said seems to enjoy himself beating him around the head. Upstairs his wife, her daughter and her boyfriend were hiding away from the men. But this attack downstairs continued, it was pointless ferocity and senselessness of the attack. The victim asked the defendants, the accused and those sentenced, why they carried out this attack. The four who were sentenced... Two of the men, thejudge said it was gratuitous pilots and they seemed to enjoy it, the other men were sentenced to 13 years, also for aggravated burglary. All of the men pleaded guilty to the charges. The victim asked the court to find out exactly why the men picked him, why they attacked him but today they were sentenced, he didn’t get an answer to the question. Plans to shorten medical training in the UK could put patients injeopardy, according to leading doctors. They’ve questioned proposals by the General Medical Council to let trainees register to practise as soon as they leave medical school rather than waiting a year. Well, with me is our Health Editor Hugh Pym. Tell us a bit more about these plans. This was an independent review backed by the General medical Council which came up with the conclusion a more general form Council which came up with the conclusion a more generalform of training was needed for doctors to cope with patients with multiple conditions, a bit less specialisation. You would become a practising doctor when you left medical school rather than having an extra year and to become a consultant especially as a consultant you do six years rather than a maximum eight years. The medical profession in the form of the BMA, the Royal College of Nurses and said they are worried. I want this to be put on hold. -- and said they are worried. I want this to be put on hold. -- Better Together they want this to be put on hold. Contacts between the Department of Health and the review team were made, there was references by officials that ministers are happy with the strategic direction and see this as an opportunity to be radical suggesting maybe an attempt to shape the final outcome of the review. The Department of Health says no, this was the normal input you would expect into this sort of process, they say no final decisions will be made on these training proposals until everybody is happy they won’t affect patients. Two pilots have set a new world record for the longest flight in a helium balloon - flying more than 5000 miles across the Pacific Ocean. The two adventurers - an American and a Russian - left japan on Sunday and had aimed to land in Canada or America. But the weather forced them to change course and head for Mexico. They set out from southern japan last weekend, hoping to fly longer and further than any previous gas balloon. The pilots, an American, Troy Bradley, and a top Russian balloonist, Leonid Tyukhtyayev. It’s not a hot air balloon, it’s filled with helium. To go up, they have to drop these colourful rope sandbags off the side. To go down, they let gas out. Thinkjules Verne and Around The World In 80 Days. This week they have been riding air currents across the Pacific, enjoying perfect conditions and making great progress, keeping in touch by satellite phone. Leonid and I are having a wonderful time up here, having a beautifulflight. The calculated risk is very well thought through. That’s why we waited so long for the right weather system. This has been their route so far, but the weather blocked their way north to Canada. So now they will land somewhere on Mexico’s Baja peninsular in the next day or so. While the two would-be record-breakers saunter their way south, it’s left their support teams racing to reach them. The Mexican immigration authorities have been informed. Snow and ice are still causing problems across parts of the UK this lunchtime. Several roads and dozens of schools remain closed. Let’s speak to our correspondent judith Moritz who’s in New Mills in Derbyshire. How are the conditions where you are? This is a town which is not used to snow at this time of year, in the high peaks, on the it gets snowy here. Yesterday the whole of the town was in gridlock, today the main roads are OK but the side roads you can see, rubbish bins have not been collected and you can see plenty of cars on the minor roads which cannot get out from their houses. This is one of many towns which has been struggling, when we filmed earlier, this morning, people were digging out and trying to get themselves off to work but schools in the town are closed. This is a picture which is mirrored around the County of Derbyshire where 60 schools are closed in total. This is not the only county affected after yesterday, there are closures in the old part of greater Manchester, East Lancashire and Staffordshire. -- Oldham part of Manchester. On the roads it is looking better than yesterday but the obvious culprits like the snake pass, which is difficult, the Woodhead Pass, trans-Pennine routes, last night 30 vehicles became stranded and had to be removed. In Staffordshire, we have a picture of the area around Stoke-on-Trent where it’s been difficult. There has been traffic jams and disruption with people trying to get out but it has been very difficult and slow. Causing all sorts of difficulties. Notjust on the roads as well, you remember yesterday Manchester Airport was closed during the morning, there are not on delays and we are told today they have had to clear snow, 18 flights have been cancelled. The advice from the airport is to check before you travel. Around the rest of the United Kingdom, Scotland and Northern Ireland are both being forecast more snow, along with northern England. We’re not out of the woods, the advice seems to be to be careful when you are out travelling, be aware of the surroundings. It is not over yet. Thank you forjoining us. And staying with the icy conditions - extraordinary pictures of a climb up a wall of ice. A Canadian climber, Will Gadd, has become the first person ever to scale a frozen section of Niagara Falls. Victoria Fritz reports. It is considered one of the most powerful waterfalls in the world. And this is professional climber Will Gadd, climbing up it, whilst the water thunders past at 70 mph. The impact of the water is equivalent to 4018 wheel trucks hitting the ground at the same time -- 4000 trucks. Locals thought they had seen it all. We have never seen anybody scaling the gorge so close to the Cascades, he could have touched it. A 140 foot climb, soaked in freezing spray. It begs the question, why? I have been ice climbing for the last 30 years and this is the coolest thing I have done. This is Niagara falls, the largest wildest and most famous and well known and coolest waterfall in North America. I got to do the first ascent. And here is the moment he made it. What a reward. SHOUTING CHEERING This is the BBC News, it is almost 1:30pm. Ourtop This is the BBC News, it is almost 1:30pm. Our top story. On the 50th anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill the country remembers its wartime leader. In a moment, Tomasz Schafernaker will be here with a full national weather forecast - plus the news where you are. But first with the latest from the Australian open and the rest of the day’s sport, here’s Hugh Wuzencroft at the BBC Sports Centre. Thank you. Good afternoon. Andy Murray will play world number one Novak Djokovic in the final of the Australian open after he knocked out Stan Wawrinka, last year ‘s winner. With 12 breaks of serve and neither player playing at his best, today’s semifinal would be encouraging for Andy Murray. Fond memories. Wawrinka on this court, he walked out the defending champion, taking on the four time champion. This had the makings of a marathon. Sure enough, a break each in the first set and it was tie-break time. Wawrinka lost his verve. First set Djokovic. The power switch in the second. Mistakes handed Wawrinka the break. Level pÂÂÂiÂÂ handed Wawrinka the break. Level pegging again. He clawed himself back from a breakdown but it did not go his way. His belief was back and when Djokovic squandered the lead again in the fourth, the Swiss himself serving for 2-2 in sets. Into the inevitable fifth set. Wawrinka was beaten. Crumbling 6-0. Andy Murray said he would go to bed if the match went on too long. No such worry for Djokovic. It is their fifth consecutive Grand Slam crown. And Bristol’s Katie ‘s one has reached the final of the girls singles. She lost against the fifth seed from Hungary. She suffered severe cramp but saved three match points in her way to the 3-set win. I really believe I will get that opportunity and I’m excited. Hopefully the nervousness will not be affecting my game or anything. I willjust go out and enjoy it. England’s cricketers have made it through to the Tri-Series final against Australia. They slumped to 66-5 at one stage, before recovering to beat India by three wickets in Perth. Tim Hague reports. They would need to beat India to get to the final and they made a good start. More easy street than Sesame Street. They disintegrated, 136-5. Steven Finn was the pick of the bowlers but Ian Bell helped him. Shami did well in the end. It should have been a simple run chase but it was not. England lost three wickets for less than 50 and then Eoin Morgan soon after forjust two runs. james Taylor and jos Buttler served UP james Taylor and jos Buttler served up a good recovery. Putting on 125 which included half centuries for both. It gave England the platform to edge over the line. The victory they wanted but it was not easy. It is Australia next in the final. Chelsea striker Diego Costa lost his appeal against a ban for violent conduct. He’s been found guilty of stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can during their League Cup tie on Tuesday. He’ll miss Chelsea’s Premier League clash with title rivals Manchester City at Stamford Bridge this weekend. Luis Figo has confirmed his candidacy for FIFA’s presidential election in May. The former World Player of the Year had already signalled his intention to stand but he’s now delivered the nominations he needed to football’s governing body. A spectacular round of 64 has given world number one Rory Mcllroy the lead at golf’s Dubai Desert Classic. He picked up eight shots in his second round, including five birdies on the back nine, to move to 14-under-par, a shot clear of Scotland’s Marc Warren. That’s all sport for now. Back to you Rita. Thank you very much. More now on our main story. It’s exactly 50 years since the state funeral of Sir Winston Churchill took place in central London. Let’s speak to our correspondent Duncan Kennedy who’s on the River Thames. You join us at the end of a very moving and poignant service on board the Havengore, the vessel which took his body down the Thames all of those years ago in 1965. Today witnessed by members of his family, his granddaughters and great-grandchildren on what must be a very moving and emotional day for them. just as it was 50 years ago for the1 million people lining the streets of London, many of whom were in tears and grief at the loss of one of the greatest English man who ever lived. Later on today at Westminster Abbey, there will be another special memorial service for Winston Churchill. -- English men. just as there was earlier today in the House of Commons with a eulogy from David Cameron. Winston Churchill may have had his critics but for many, many people he still remains one of the most historical and important figures of the 20th century. Many thanks, Duncan Kennedy there. Time for a look at the weather... Here’s Tomasz Schafernaker. Thank you. There is still a lot of cold weather on the way and it may even get a bit colder over the next few days. This is a dramatic picture from Leicestershire. I have been practising that pronunciation! Pretty dramatic conditions. I say dramatic. We will get some dramatic conditions in this country. The cold winds will continue into next week with snow showers across mainly northern parts of the country. This is where most of the wintry weather is actually today. Parts of Scotland, wind will being creasing over the next 12 - 18 hours. With blizzards across the hills. For most of us the weather is not bad. We have sunshine in a few places. Let’s have a look at rush-hour. Lots of us will be heading home for the weekend. Some of them will be sleety. The bulk of England and Wales at this stage will be clear. Temperatures will be around five or 6 degrees. What will be happening through Friday night into Saturday and Sunday, we will actually see the air becoming colder. It was art coming off the Arctic. Through the course of tonight, very strong winds. -- it will start. Ice will develop across parts of the country. It is stating the obvious but take it steady. If you are travelling first thing in the morning, there could be ice around almost anywhere in the UK. The isobars are coming from the Arctic north with low pressure. So there will be lots of strong winds in Scotland. That means blizzards. Particularly across the hills but not exclusively. There will be nasty conditions here. There will also be wintry showers elsewhere in the country. It is more like freezing or below with the wind chill. On Sunday if there is any wintry weather it will more than likely come across the North Sea coasts, namely one or two clipping the West. Many inland areas, probably getting away with just a bit of sunshine. It will be cold, three degrees in Newcastle and five in the South. Here is the headline. You guessed it, it is staying on the cold side! Wrap up warm. Thank you very much, Thomas. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime... On the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill- the country remembers its wartime leader. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Sonja jessup. A former police marksmen has pleaded not guilty to the murder of robbery suspect Azelle Rodney in north London. Mr Rodney who was 24 died after officers stopped the car he was travelling in with two other men in Edgware in 2005. Anthony Long, a former specialist firearms officer with the Met Police appeared at Southwark Crown Court. He’s been released on unconditional bail till his trial injune. The Church of England is investigating a vicar in Surrey-who’s accused of actively promoting claims that Israel was behind the September 11th attacks. The Reverend Stephen Sizer, the vicar of Christ Church, in Virginia Waters posted a link on Facebook to an article entitled ""9/11: Israel did it"". The Diocese of Guildford says it’s taking ""immediate steps"" to investigate."" An increasing number of pupils from London are applying to British Universities - according to the latest official figures. There’s also a record high in the number of teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds applying. The government says recent reforms have broken down barriers to higher education. Alice Bhandhukravi has this report. These are the civil engineers of the future, or so they hope. With tuition fees of around £9,000 a year, these students at Kingston University believe the investment will be worth the jobs they get when they graduate. In London an increasing number of school leavers are making this choice. Really the fact that the student loan covers the money is the big thing. Therefore I went to university. Obviously I want to pay it back some day and hopefully I will get a good job. The proportion of 18-year-olds applying to university from London has increased from 42.1% last year to 43.8% this year. That is a bigger rise than anywhere else in the country. Not only that but applications from those from disadvantaged ",,

The Church of England and the Catholic Church call on politicians to prevent the creation of so-called three-parent babies. They argue that more needs to be done to prove the procedure which aims to stop genetic abnormalities in babies isn’t dangerous. We need to be absolutely clear that the techniques will be safe and we need to be absolutely sure that they will work. But some families, like this mother whose lost seven children to a genetic abnormality, say it’s the only way to prevent further deaths. We are not playing God or anything, this is trying to make children survive. MPs are to vote next week whether to allow the procedure to go ahead. We’ll be looking at the medical and ethical debate surrounding it. Also tonight: Beaten up beyond recognition - four burglars are jailed for attacking a law professor in his own home. Criticism that plans to reduce the number of years doctors spend in training could put patients’ lives at risk. And 50 years after his death, the country remembers Winston Churchill. Tonight on BBC London... Criticism of the Mayor after he brands Muslim extremists as ""losers"" who’re hooked on pornography. And a Surrey vicar’s under investigation after he posted an internet article blaming Israel for 9/11. Families affected by the Moreton Hall baby Ashes scandal are offered cash settlements. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The Church of England and the Catholic Church have have called on politicians to prevent the creation of so-called three-parent babies. The procedure aims to prevent mothers from passing on serious and often fatal genetic diseases to their children. It involves using DNA from both parents and a donor to create a baby free of genetic abnormality. Both Churches argue it wouldn’t be ""responsible"" to change the law without more research. MPs are preparing to vote on it early next week. Fergus Walsh reports. Life, created in a dish. IVF is commonplace, but now British scientists want to use the technique to fix a severe genetic disorder. There have been three detailed reviews, all backing the science, but now, just days before a crucial vote in the Commons, the Church of England says it would be premature to change the law. We need to be absolutely clear that the techniques which will be used will be safe, and absolutely sure that they will work. So we have ethics, efficacy and safety. And the Church of England is simply saying that until all of those three things are fully in place, regulation should not be brought forward. If MPs do approve the technique it will come too late to help Sharon, mother of seven children, all of whom died from mitochondrial disease, a fault past in her DNA. Edward survived to 21. The others died whenjust in her DNA. Edward survived to 21. The others died when just days old. We are not playing with God or any thing. This is trying to make children survive. No child should be born with a disease that is going to end their life. I cannot believe anybody from the church would want that for couples. So how could this procedure help couples at risk of passing on a serious genetic disease? It begins with IVF treatment. At the centre of the embryo is the parent’s nucleus, containing the key DNA that shapes our appearance and personality. This would be removed, leaving behind the mitochondria. When these biological power packs for cells are faulty, women can pass on a range of life threatening diseases, causing brain damage, blindness or heart failure. The nucleus is transferred to another woman’s egg, containing only its healthy mitochondria. The embryo will have 22,000 genes from the parents and just 37 genes from the donor. That genetic change would be passed on to future generations. The technique has firm support from government and major science bodies, including the Wellcome Trust, which funds labs pioneering this research. I am convinced this is safe. There has been ten years of effort to prove its safety and we need to move this technique and offer it to families who have had devastating experiences with having children with this condition. If, as expected, Parliament approves it, clinics will be free to apply for a licence. Around 150 couples per year could benefit, with the first birth as early as next year. A gang of Polish burglars who beat a university law professor until he was ""utterly unrecognisable"" have beenjailed. It emerged in court that the men had more than 30 previous convictions between them back in Poland. Their attack left Paul Kohler with a fractured eye socket and jawbone, and a broken nose after the attack at his home in London. He demanded in court that his attackers tell him why he was targeted. Daniel Boettcher was there. His face almost unrecognisable, this was Paul Kohler after what was described in court as a savage attack, a raid on his home by four burglars, leaving him with a fractured jaw and eye socket and a broken nose. At the time, they thought my skull was fractured. This was him speaking a week later, still severely bruised and trying to understand why this might have happened. There is a sense of bewilderment, this is not really happening. You almost stand outside, looking on it as if it is a gangster movie. The attack happened last summer at ten o’clock at night. Paul Kohler answered his front door thinking it was friends or family. Bor men burst in, their faces covered by scarves. One shouted, where is the money. Paul Kohler screamed back, you have the wrong address. He was pushed to the floor and one sat on him and another punched and kicked him, while two threatened his wife upstairs. His daughter and friend called the police. The four men have all been jailed for aggravated burglary. The two who were hitting and kicking Paul Kohler when police arrived were also sentenced for causing grievous bodily harm. CCTV shows one of the men running away through traffic. Another image shows one of them taking off the gloves used during the raid. All but one of them had served jail terms in Poland but the Home Office says they would not have shown up on systems for exchanging information with other EU states. Paul Kohler says the convictions in Poland should be treated like any other and that what happened to him was mindless thuggery. People who have served their time come out eventually. The argument that they should have been allowed into the UK, perhaps, but that requires more cooperation between states. He says he feels vindicated by the sentence and still believes his home was targeted by mistake. Let’s speak to our Home Affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford. Daniel, why were these men, who had so many convictions between them in Poland, allowed into the country? The case highlights two issues. First, a European citizen arriving in Britain with a European passport, there are not checks done on their criminal record. The Home Secretary was in Latvia today arguing with fellow home affairs ministers in Europe that there should be a Europe -wide criminal record database. Even if she wins that argument it will take many years to build and will probably only include the most serious offences, like murder. The second issue is that one of these men actually had committed quite serious offences here, was then extradited to Poland to serve a sentence therefore further offences he had committed there, but was still able to come back into Britain. That, clearly, is something that can be dealt with, and the Home Office believes if he arrived in Britain today they have a system in place whereby he would have been on a watchlist and would have been refused entry by an immigration on arrival. Although that does assume that the system they now have in place works, and it does not deal with people who simply arrived here on false identity documents. Thank you. The British Medical Association has criticised plans drawn up by an independent review to shorten the length of medical training for doctors across the UK. The BMA says patients’ lives could be put at risk by the proposed changes. The Department of Health says it wants doctors to be more flexible. Hugh Pym has the story. He hasjust been appointed a consultant and is now heading a campaign by a doctors’ group against plans to cut by two years the length of specialist training. This anaesthetist says go back two years and he would not have felt nearly so confident. There is not a consensus in the medical profession that this is the right way to go forward. The report suggests that training programmes will be shorter and we do not think they will produce people of the standard patients have come to expect. The plans were drawn up after an independent review backed by the General Medical Council. Currently, once junior doctors leave medical school they undertake one closely supervised year of practice. Under new proposals, they would be registered to practice straight after graduation. If they go on to become specialists, it currently takes between six and eight years, but could be reduced to between four and six years. The idea is to produce more doctors who are generalists, with a wider range of experience, and that has been welcomed in some quarters. The nature and shape of health care in this country will change radically in the nearfuture, not the distant future. Of course, you have to review training. The principal issue we are seeing today is a knee jerk reaction from medical unions. So how much influence has Whitehall had in this review process? Documents seen by the BBC obtained under the Freedom of Information Act set out details of meetings between Department of Health officials and members of the review team. They indicate the government’s strong support for reform. The minutes of the meetings during the Shape of Training Review include reference to ministers setting strategic direction and feeling happy. The final report did not refer to these meetings. A Department of Health spokesman said this was no more than routine engagement with the independent review. No decisions had yet been taken on shortening doctors training. Change will only happen if it is in the best interest of patients. But the controversial plans are still on the table. Hugh Pym, BBC News. The Egyptian President, Abdul Fattah Al-Sisi, has cut short a visit to an African Union summit to deal with an upsurge in violence in the Sinai peninsula. Yesterday militants allying themselves with the so-called Islamic State launched rocket attacks on a military base and hotel in north Sinai, killing 32 soldiers and police officers. The fates of a jordanian pilot and a japanese journalist being held hostage by so-called Islamic State militants is still unknown a day after a deadline for a prisoner swap passed. jordan is ready to swap an Iraqi woman convicted for an attempted suicide bombing for Lieutenant Moaz Al-Kasasba but is asking for proof he’s still alive. The wife of the japanese hostage Kenji Goto has pleaded for his release. The authorities in Saudi Arabia have again postponed a round of lashes on a 30-year-old blogger, Raif Badawi. He was sentenced to 1000 lashes, 50 every Friday, and ten years in prison for insulting Islam. His family are now hopeful that he may be included in a round of royal pardons for some prisoners. His case has caused an international outcry. Lucy Manning reports. Set to be flogged again, but reprieved again, for the third Friday in a row. Raif Badawi has escaped the lashes. This was his first public flogging, jude to be repeated week after week. And there could be a route to freedom. A Royal decree has announced that the king will pardon some Saudi prisoners. In Canada, where Raif Badawi’s wife has sought asylum, she is appealing to the new Saudi king. TRANSLATION: I wish the king would issue a pardon for him. I hope the Saudi government issues a pardon as soon as possible because there are children here who are being denied their father. children here who are being denied theirfather. Raif Badawi published a website promoting free speech, sometimes critical of religion. With the death of King Abdullah last week, the new Saudi monarch has received a stream of world leaders. The Saudi embassy here is well aware of the spotlight on the kingdom with a new ruler. Prince Charles will visit the country again in ten days time. His spokes man will not say whether he will raise human rights issues, only that he is travelling at the request of the British government and will represent British interests in the region. It would be very good if Prince Charles, who knows the royalfamily well, would talk about the Raif Badawi situation and asked the King to stop the appalling floggings. There is support for Raif Badawi’s wife from the journalists of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo. We can campaign, because he is paying the price for his freedom of speech, as my colleagues also paid the price for their freedom as my colleagues also paid the price for theirfreedom of speech. For the new Saudi king, the dilemma is an old one, balancing the conservative forces with those who want reform. Our top story: The Church of England and the Catholic church call on politicians to prevent the creation of so-called 3-parent babies. Still to come, the old firm Later on BBC London... Extending London’s air ambulance services - surgeons say building a third helipad will help save many more lives. And Chelsea’s star striker is banned for violent conduct - Diego Costa will now miss three crucial games. And 50 years on from Churchill’s funeral, one man who played a crucial role. 50 years ago today, the UK came to a standstill for the funeral of one of its greatest leaders, Winston Churchill. The former Prime Minister who led Britain to victory in World War Two is the only commoner to receive a state funeral in the 20th century. Earlier, David Cameron laid a wreath at a statue of Churchill, saying he would be remembered notjust as a great leader, but as a great Briton. Duncan Kennedy is at Westminster Abbey for us now. Duncan, it has been a day of memories. It has indeed Fiona. You join us here at Westminster Abbey, where tonight there is a memorial service for Winston Churchill, attended by members of his family of course where his body lay in state 50 years ago. It really has been a day of remembrance and tributes, from Prime Ministers and from ordinary people, for the man who really did change the course of British history. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields. Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. We shall never surrender. He was the war-time leader who inspired a nation to victory and today that nation remembered him. 50 years ago, Winston Churchill’s funeral brought the country to a standstill. A million people came to London to see it, 25 million watched it on television. He had become a father to the nation. Any mistakes forgotten in patriotic gratitude. Today the Prime Minister paid his own tribute in the Commons, the place where Churchill’s own oratory had so often mesmerised a country in peril. History has been kind to Winston Churchill, not because he wrote it, but because he shaped it. He left a Britain more free, more secure, more brave and more proud. Churchill’s final waterborne voyage was recreated today on board Havengore, the barge retracing the exact route it had taken after the funeral service. Thousands of river banks and bridges came out to watch. Churchill’s appeal undimmed by five decades of history. He was the greatest Englishman that has ever lived. I don’t think there will ever be another man like him. I think that Churchill, for all his faults, it was like cometh the man, cometh the hour. He did what had to be done in terms of getting us through the war. The short, moving memorial on Havengore ended with this simple gesture -- Havengore ended with this simple gesture -- and a moment for reflection on Churchill’s legacy. It’s been really amazing that people still do mind as much as they did on the day he died practically. So, it’s notjust his family, we are all in harmony with the people of this country. Winston Churchill’s final journey on the Thames only lasted a few minutes but its imagery and resonance has endured for half a century. Today’s ceremony, like the original funeral a mixture of remembrance, tribute and sadness. Winston Churchill’s funeral came at a cultural and political crossroads in British life. The man, as iconic as the cranes that bowed down before his passing coffin, a respectful tilt to him and to history. Well, extraordinary images and thoughts there on a day of reflection and tributes for the man whose legacy really does stay with us, five decades after his death. Thank you. A notorious leader of the apartheid era death squads in South Africa, Eugene de Kock, has been granted parole after more than 20 years in prison. He was known as ""Primeval"" for his role in the torture and murder of more than 100 ANC activists, as our Africa Correspondent, Andrew Harding, reports. In modern South Africa, evil has always had a face - Eugene de Kock, the quiet policeman who confessed to killing and torturing dozens of black activists in the years before the end of racial apartheid. De Kock was sentenced to life in prison many times over. His nickname - Prime Evil. But 19 years on, is it time to forgive? This morning, the South African government finally said yes. In the interests of nation-building and reconciliation, I have decided to place Mr De Kock on parole. In recent months, de Kock has met some of his victims’ families in jail, seeking forgiveness. Sandra’s husband was shot dead by de Kock in 1992, part of a campaign to wreck South Africa’s transition to democracy. You really look at this guy and you think - my goodness, am I really face-to-face with this killer? When he said, ""I’m sorry"" he was really saying I’m sorry, it was notjust - I’m saying it because I need to get parole. It’s thought many of de Kock’s victims were dumped in this deep pit. But as horrific as Prime Evil’s crimes were, this is notjust about one man, it is about the system that enabled him and the fact that almost nobody else was made to pay the price. Was it perhaps an official cover-up, Prime Evil as the ultimate scapegoat? He didn’tjust wake up one morning and say - I’m going to do this. He got the instructions from the top. REPORTER: And they got away with it? They got away with it. But some think de Kock himself has got off too lightly today. This man was a human rights lawyer blown up by one of his letter bombs. At least 50 years. 50 years in prison? Yes. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu said today - forgiveness is not easy. Waiting times for patients at A&E units in England have improved for the third week in a row. 93% of patients were seen and treated within four hours - still below the 95% target but an improvement on the previous week. Now, it used to be the highlight of the Scottish football season - the Old Firm derbies between Rangers and Celtic. The great Glasgow rivals dominated their Premier League. But three years ago Rangers were liquidated and then relegated and many in the game say the whole of Scottish football has suffered as a result. But this weekend the old rivals meet again in the Scottish League Cup, as Andy Swiss reports. This report contains some flash photography. Style and extraordinary success. Rangers once had the lot until one of sport’s most spectacular downfalls Rangers, one of the giants of world football have been consigned to life among the minnows of the Scottish game. Three years ago, the club was destroyed by debt and banished to the bottom division and that wasjust and banished to the bottom division and that was just the start. This month has seen more problems, more protests but the fans prepare to face Celtic again and these are still bitter times. From being a team that was so big. Still we are big, just to drop down, it was heart-breaking to all of us. Angry, disbelief, frustration, they are all in there. I can’t describe how difficult it has been. It is torture, one thing after another. Every day it is something different. And this is now Rangers’ reality. Their recent game at this second Hove tier club, in front of 3,000 fans. Many of Rangers supporters now have had enough. Last year’s season tickets slumped by 15,000. The club later reported an £8 million loss and this week only a £10 million loan meant they could pay their wages. But now the Cup has pitched them against Celtic for the first time since 2012. Celtic won then and some believe in the intervening years, the game has lost. Scottish football, whether people like Rangers or not, have missed them in the premier division. The same in Scotland has lost a lot of money. Celtic have dominated in Rangers’ absence but they know the Old Firm is still the biggest draw. Without derbies, football is losing something. I hope and I think it will be peaceful but very much emotions and that’s a good thing. So, a city will once again be united and divided in football. The waiting is nearly over. Now, it’s a much-loved family classic - Chitty Chitty Bang Bang but did you know it’s based on a series of books written by Ian Fleming - better known forjames Bond, of course? He never lived to see their success and now, decades later, as a new special edition is being published, we speak to the original illustrator as Royah Nikkah reports. It turned away and soared away over the hills. The story might be half a century old but it still has the power to capture young imaginations. And perhaps the most beautiful car in the world... Designing the famous car was a daunting challenge for john Burningham, then a young illustratorjust starting out. You know, you have a car that flies - how the hell are you going to draw that? It is a problem. Sol how the hell are you going to draw that? It is a problem. So I decided to make a model. If you read the text of the book, wings come out of the front, so you think - text of the book, wings come out of the front, so you think - well, it must be the mudguards that open up in some way or the other and there is a certain logic to it. Hollywood immortgagealised the flying car a few years after the book -- immortalised. Sadly, Fleming died before he could see Chitty’s soaring success. We have lost them. We’ll find them all right. He would have been amazed that it has lasted 50 years, the basic concept of a car that can fly and take children on adventures is irresewsible. The iconic car, flying from the page to the silver screen and the enduring success of the film has kept the story alive, a tale enthralling children 50 years on. Fleming famously loved fast cars and gadgets. Chitty was the ultimate combination, bringing his passions to a new audience. When it comes out garage it goes Martin Mubanga. Fleming - garage it goes Martin Mubanga. Fleming - it goes Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Fleming might be known for his spy books...

The snow we have got that has fallen, isn’t going to melt. It’ll stay cold. You will need a few layers on. A few more snow showers around but most will see sunshine, particularly so on Sunday. Showers tonight are mostly of snow over the hills. A mixture of rain and sleet elsewhere. But whatever type of shower you get, there is the risk of things turning icy on roads and pavements as temperatures drop down close to or get to zero in towns and cities. A bitterly cold start. There will be showers across parts of eastern England. Snow over the North York Moors. Furtherwest England. Snow over the North York Moors. Further west showers down across Wales and south-west England. Again over the moors, snow. across Wales and south-west England. Again overthe moors, snow. Mostly at low levels, showers of rain, a strong and cold wind picking up. The winds lighter further east. Again the possibility of a covering of snow. Most of the showers here will be of rain in the morning. Sunshine across northern England and southern Scotland. A mixture of sunshine and wintry showers for Northern Ireland. Across northern Scotland, continuing snow showers here, initially mostly over the hills but increasingly down to lower levels. As the winds pick up, there could be gusts of 50 or 60 miles per hour. The winds pick up in western areas, too, around the coasts. Again gusts of 50 or 60 miles per hour. Snow showers elsewhere. Snow mixed in but most of the showers of rain or sleet. Temperatures will read four or five on the thermometer but add on a bitterly cold wind it’ll feel more like zero or minus 3 or four. The cold wind with us on Sunday. Snow showers across northern Scotland. One or two elsewhere. But for the bulk of the UK, Sunday looks dry and bright. Sunshine again but temperatures struggling at three or four. Add on the wind and it feels colder. And that’s it from us. Goodbye from me, now on Tonight on BBC London News. The Mayor brands Muslim extremists as ""losers"" who are likely to be hooked on pornography - does he regret the language he used? Not remotely, I don’t think anybody could seriously contest a word I said. But critics say Boris johnson’s comments are vulgar and unhelpful. Also tonight...

The growing number of London students applying for university - we hear claims that tuition fees are no longer a barrier. Stopping road traffic. A towering tribute to Winston Churchill and the Essex surgeon who helped mark the 50th anniversary of his funeral. ~ I assumed the bridge would go to that sort of angle but the wonderful man in the control room said, no, we are going to almost the full 90. Wow. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Victoria Hollins. Boris johnson’s been criticised after describing men who join religious extremist groups such as Islamic State as ""losers"" who are likely to be users of pornography. The Mayor of London told a newspaper that he believes those turning to violence had low self-esteem and were unsuccessful with women. The Tory politician cited an MI5 report into extremism that had compiled psychological profiles of jihadists. But his critics say his analysis is simplistic, vulgar and unhelpful, as Nick Beake reports. British-bornjihadis British-born jihadis who have declared war on the west. He says they are his biggest concern. He says his police force needs millions more to fight them and he says they are losers who can’t get women and are obsessed with pornography. Do you regret using the language you did? Not remotely, I don’t think anybody could seriously contest a word I said. Today he dropped in on a south London School where he was supposed to be promoting cleaner air but some had already condemned him for turning it blue. They said his pornography explanation was crude and irresponsible. It is an X-rated way of dealing with a very serious issue affecting lie lives, our International and communal relations, and it can’t be distilled to tabloid language that is smutty about sex and women. One can senior Conservative colleague defended the comments. He always uses colourful language but he is right that we should not have kind words for these people. Borisjohnson said the link betweenjihadis and people. Borisjohnson said the link between jihadis and pornography was well established and said agents from MI5 had identified the link. Today the Security service rather unsurprisingly was not willing to share the research. He may have had no regrets about his language but he clarified his message. It is symptomatic of a feeling amongst young men who are led off into jihadis ideology that the world is against them and there is nothing there for them. The answer is to get them into work. Last week Boris johnson met those in Iraq fighting against the so-called Islamic - Islamic State. Some may welcome his attack on a group which has murdered so many but the way he has done it as certainly raised eyebrows. -- so many but the way he has done it as certainly raised eyebrows. -- has certainly. Lots more to come, including... Helping to treat critically ill patients - now London’s air ambulance service is to have a third helipad. The Church of England is investigating a vicar in Surrey who’s accused of actively promoting claims that Israel was behind the 9/11 terror attacks. The Reverend Stephen Sizer, who has a history of disputes with jewish community leaders, posted a link on social media to an article blaming the atrocities on Israel. The vicar denies he holds anti-Semitic views, as Alex Bushill reports. Let’s pray together. As his website shows the reverend Seaman size is used to being the centre of attention but he is also now the centre of a mighty row. -- attention but he is also now the centre of a mighty row. -- reverend seat -- Stephen centre of a mighty row. -- reverend seat-- Stephen size. Stephen size shared a link to a claim that Israel was behind the 9/11 attacks. The response of the jewish community was shocked, anger and a steely determination to make sure that his activities are put a stop to. Although this affluent corner of Surrey is not used to being the centre of a controversy, it is not the first time the reverend has upsetjewish community the first time the reverend has upset jewish community leaders. The Reverend Stephen size was not at parish today but he has removed his post and he seems to have answered his own question, is this anti-Semitic? He said researching all aspects of 9/11 is not anti-Semitic and suppressing such work will fuel suspicion. Can he rely on the support of his parishioners, like Peter, who has known him for 20 years? I think he has made a big mistake but I think the church should look after themselves and not worry too much about the rest of the world. He is in a position where he is maybe listened to and his views are probably more poignant that he is entitled to his own view. I think maybe he has been slightly irresponsible in that that is a really brash statement to make and the massive generalisation and it is way too far. Tonight the reverend Isa released a statement. He said he very much regretted and apologised for the distress caused. He said the material he shared was ill considered and misguided. He said he will be ceasing all use of social media with immediate effect and until further notice.

Later on BBC London: Criticism of the Mayor, after he brands Muslim extremists as losers hooked on pornography. A Surrey vicar is under investigation, after he posted an article on the internet blaming Israel for the 9/11 terror attacks. Good evening. The Church of England and the Catholic Church have have called on politicians to prevent the creation of so-called three-parent babies. The procedure aims to prevent mothers from passing on serious and often fatal genetic diseases to their children. It involves using DNA from both parents and a donor to create a baby free of genetic abnormality. Both churches argue it would be irresponsible to change the law without more research. MPs are preparing to vote on it early next week. Our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, reports. Life created in a dish, IVF is commonplace, but now British scientists want to use the technique to fix a severe genetic disorder. There have been three detailed reviews all backing the science, but now, just days before a crucial Commons vote, the Church of England says it will be premature to change the law. We need to be absolutely clear that the techniques that will be used will be safe, and we need to be absolutely sure that they will work, so we’ve got ethics. We have efficacy. We’ve got safety. The Church of England is simply saying, until all those three things are fully in place, regulation shouldn’t be brought forward. If MPs do approve the technique, it will come too late to help Sharon, a mother of seven children, all of whom died from mitochondrial disease, a fault passed in her DNA. Edward survived to 21, the others died when just days old. We’re not playing with God or anything. This is trying to make children survive. No child should be born with a disease that’s going to end their life. I cannot believe anybody from the church would want that for couples. How would this work? It begins with IVF treatment. At the centre of the embryo is the parents’ nucleus containing the key DNA that shapes our appearance and personality, this would be removed, leaving behind the mitochondria. When these cells are faulty, women can pass on a range of life-threatening diseases, causing brain damage, blindness or heart failure. The nucleus is transferred to another woman’s embryo, containing only healthy mitochondria. This embryo will have 22,000 genes from the parents and just 37 genes from the donor. That genetic change will be passed on to future generations. The technique has firm support from Government and major science bodies, including the Wellcome Trust, which funds labs pioneering this new research. I’m convinced this is safe. There’s been seven to ten years of an enormous amount of effort to prove its safety. We need to move this technique and offer it to the families who’ve had devastating experiences with having children with this condition. If, as expected, Parliament approves it, clinics will be free to apply for a license. Around 150 couples a year could benefit, with the first birth as early as next year. This opposition, is that likely to sway MPs? It’s a free vote, we can’t be sure, but I doubt. It the Commons on Tuesday and the House of Lords two weeks later, I think they’ll be guided by the three scientific reviews, the ethical review and the public consultation which were broadly supportive. I can’t remember another proposed treatment which has gone under this level of scrutiny. That scrutiny is important, because this extra tiny bit of DNA from the donor woman will be a permanent change to what’s called the germ line. It will be passed down the generations. Once this has been permitted, it can’t be undone. It’s been tried in the lab. It’s been tried in animal research. It all suggests it’s safe. We won’t be certain until it’s actually going ahead. Britain, which has led the world on genetics research and on fertility treatment, will combine those and be the first country then to approve this treatment. Thank you. A gang of Polish burglars, who beat a university law professor until he was unrecognisable, have beenjailed. Their attack left Paul Kohler, from London, needing facial reconstruction, after being attacked when he opened his front door to the gang in August last year. It emerged in court that the men had more than 30 previous convictions between them back in Poland. Our home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, has the story. Beaten until his face was unrecognisable, this was Paul Kohler just after the brutal burglary last August. I was hit a number of times. The chap in the front started saying, ""Where’s the money? Six days later, his face was heavily bruised. His eye socket and nose fractured, after two men had beaten and kicked him in his own home for eight minutes. His terrified family upstairs. The burglars fled empty handed, when the police arrived. One of them was recorded on a security camera, getting rid of the latex gloves he was wearing. Most likely they thought, wrongly, that they were targeting a wealthy criminal. In their car, police discovered a flame thrower, possibly for torturing their victim. Today the four men were sentenced to long prison terms. Two of them, who did the victim, were given 19 years. Their accomplices 13. Paul Kohler, now largely recovered, was at court today and said his family was still suffering. The emotional legacy is my wife in particular still gets flashback abouts it. She’s still fearful of leaving the children at home in the house, even though the youngest is 18, later this year. We know that three of the four defendants had significant previous convictions overin significant previous convictions over in Poland for armed robbery, multiple burglary offences and violent assaults against people in Poland. All three had come to the UK without anyone being aware of their criminal histories. Put simply, there is no way of checking the overseas criminal record of a European Union citizen arriving in Britain. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, was in Latvia only this week trying to persuade fellow EU ministers to share information about criminal convictions more widely, but a robust system is several years off and even then, it may only cover the most serious offences. This man could have been stopped. He had multiple convictions in Britain too and was sent back to Poland. But he still managed to return and terrify the Kohler family in their home. The influence of Islamic State extremists has been felt in Egypt, where the worst-ever, anti-government violence has left over 30 people dead. Local Islamist militants have allied themselves with IS and carried out a wave of attacks. Most of the dead were soldiers. The attacks took place in northern Sinai, where Egyptian security forces had been claiming success in a long offensive against the militants. It raises new concerns over security in the region. Sinai borders strategic areas such as the Suez Canal, the Gaza Strip and Israel. Our Middle East correspondent, Orla Guerin, is in Cairo. It certainly sounds like a worrying development. Well, yes. Egypt’s president had to cut short a trip to Ethiopia to come home to deal with this crisis. He says his country is paying the price for fighting terrorism. Now it’s only three months since another attack by the same group claimed the lives of more than 30 troops. The prime minister today predicted more violence in the run up to Parliamentary elections due in March. Officials say the latest deadly strike took place as some of the soldiers were watching football. Full military honours for some of Fqvpts Full military honours for some of Egypt’s fallen soldiers, a huge loss for the army and a challenge to the state. The generals are pledging to step up their battle against insurgents in Sinai, who now kill in the name of Isis. They struck under cover of darkness. This unverified video is believed to capture one of the attacks, about a dozen targets were hit. Simultaneously, in three locations. These are the militants behind the attack. They pledged allegiance to Isis in November, rebranding themselves the Sinai province of Islamic State. Experts say they are gaining in skill and strength. The overall result is that you’re having an insurgency that’s growing in its size, in its scale, in its scope and in its intensity and now, for the first time, you have non-state actors in Egypt with this level of sophistication in terms of arms attack and in terms of arms acquisition and the type and number of arms they have. The militants have taken root in the sands of Sinai, where bed wan tribes have long complained of neglect and movement controlled by the army. This is now a key battle ground for Egypt. What happens in this strategically important peninsula is also a concern for Egypt’s neighbours. Instability here is a threat to the region. And militants based in Sinai have shown themselves to be a resilient enemy. That enemy benefits from the poverty and lack of development here. Locals tell us they’re struggling to survive. She says she has four sons, all with diplomas, but none with a job. She says they sit home, idle and depressed, and this pushes young men into crime. Others say the massive army offensive here is pushing them into the arms of the insurgents. In northern Sinai, the army has demolished entire neighbourhoods and imposed a curfew and a state of emergency. In this troubled corner of the Middle East, Isis seems to be gaining a new foot hold. Waiting times for patients at A&E units in England have improved for the third week in a row. 93% of patients were seen and treated within four hours - still below the 95% target - but an improvement on the previous week. A notorious leader of the apartheid-era death squads in South Africa, Eugene de Kock, has been granted parole after more than 20 years in prison. He was known as ""Prime Evil"" for his role in the torture and murder of more than 100 ANC activists. The South Africanjustice Minister says De Kock will be released ""in the interests of nation-building"". Our Africa correspondent, Andrew Harding, reports. In modern South Africa, evil has always had a face, Eugene de Kock, the quiet policeman who confessed to killing and torturing dozens of black activists in the years before the end of racial apartheid. De Kock was sentenced to life in prison many times over. His nickname? Prime Evil. 19 years on, is it time to forgive? This morning the South African government finally said yes. In the interest of nation building and reconciliation, I’ve decided to place Mr De Kock on parole. In recent months, De Kock has met some of his victims’ families in jail, seeking forgiveness. Sandra’s husband was shot dead by De Kock in 1992, part of a campaign to wreck South Africa’s transition to democracy. You really look at this guy and think, ""My goodness, am I really face to face with this killer?""' When he said, ""I’m sorry,"" you could see he’s sorry. It’s notjust,""I’m saying it because I need to get parole.""' You could see in his eyes that he was genuine. It’s thought many of De Kock’s victims were dumped in this deep pit. As horrific as Prime Evil’s crimes were, this is notjust about one man. It’s about the system that enabled him and the fact that almost nobody else was made to pay the price. Was it perhaps an official cover up? Prime Evil as the ultimate scapegoat. He didn’tjust wake up one morning and say, ""I’m going to do this."" He got the instructions from the top. And got away with it? They got away with it. They’re living, you know, they’re amongst us today. One man is taking the fall. But some think De Kock him self has got off too lightly today. Becky was a human rights lawyer, blown up by one of De Kock’s letter bombs. They called him the killing machine. I don’t think it’s justice. At least 50 years. 50 years in prison? Yes. He deserves that. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu said today, forgiveness is not easy. 50 years ago today, the UK came to a standstill for the funeral of one of its greatest leaders, Winston Churchill. The former Prime Minister who led Britain to victory in World War Two is the only commoner to receive a state funeral in the 20th century. Earlier, David Cameron laid a wreath at a statue of Churchill, saying he would be remembered notjust as a great leader, but as a great Briton. Duncan Kennedy followed today’s events. We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds. in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender. Historic words from the man who changed the course of history, remembered 50 years on. The breathtaking scenes of public mourning at Churchill’s funeral, unprecedented for a commoner in the 20th century. Echoing to the sound of these solemn funeral marches, one after the other... All there to pay tribute to his wartime resolve and courage. The Prime Ministerjoined the eulogies in the shadow of the man whose Commons speeches stirred the spirit of the nation facing Nazi tyranny. History has been kind to Winston Churchill, not because he wrote it, but because he shaped it. Today, Tower Bridge was raised to let the Havengore past, the ancient wooden barge that had carried Churchill’s coffin. Thousands lined the Thames to watch its sedate passage, past modern London buildings Churchill would not have recognised, and ending at one that he would. He was the greatest Englishman that ever lived, and I don’t think there’ll ever be another man like him. I think that Churchill, for all his faults, it was like, cometh the man, cometh the hour. He did what had to be done in terms of getting us through the war. The Havengore was used in recognition of Churchill’s nautical past. Where pallbearers once stood guard, today family members gathered to deliver their own personal homage. People still do mind as much as they did on the day he died, practically. So it’s notjust his family. We are all in harmony with the people of this country. Winston Churchill’s finaljourney on the Thames only lasted a few minutes. But its imagery and resonance has endured for half a century. Today’s ceremonies, like the original funeral, a mixture of reverence, tribute and sadness. At Westminster Abbey tonight, a more intimate family memorial, from the generations that once knew him, to those who will come to know him. Modern views of Winston Churchill have changed, but for most he remains as iconic as the cranes that once bowed before his passing coffin, in a tilting nod to greatness. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News. Following talks in Athens with the head of the eurozone group, the new Greek Foreign Minister said his government would rather talk directly to the countries bailed Greece out. Next week, the Government is expected to announce who will head up the controversial historic child abuse review. So far two people nominated to lead it have been forced to resign. Today, it emerged that secret briefing documents prepared for Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s revealed that a senior British diplomat had sexual fantasies about children that left him vulnerable to blackmail. It concluded that Sir Peter Hayman was also a member of the paedophile lobbying organisation, the Paedophile Information Exchange. Tom Symonds is with me. Explain the significance of these documents. Sur Peter Hayman was the diplomat who was revealed in parliament to have left a packet of paedophile literature on a bus. He was not charged and there were allegations of a cover-up, exactly the kind of case that this public enquiry will be looking at. So when this file turned up, found by a research a week ago, titled sexual proclivities, security aspects, there was a clamour for it to be made public, as has now happened. What does it tell us about Peter Hayman, it says he was engaged in sexual perversion, had sexual fantasies about children, was regarded as a security risk, vulnerable to blackmail by foreign powers. Government officials at the time were told to push the line that there had not been a cover-up. But what is most significant is the speed at which this file has been opened up to the public, injust speed at which this file has been opened up to the public, in just one week, because of the pressure. That shows the kind of atmosphere there is, the pressure to shed light on these stories from the past. There will now be a renewed hunt for these files. The police will be looking at this file, I have been told. The public enquiry is installed at the moment that will be rebooted next week by the Home Secretary. The authorities in Saudi Arabia have again postponed a round of lashes on a 30-year-old blogger, Raif Badawi. He has been sentenced to 1000 lashes, 50 every Friday, and ten years in prison for insulting Islam. His case has caused an international outcry. His wife has told BBC News she is now hopeful that he may be included in a round of royal pardons for some prisoners. Lucy Manning reports. Set to be flogged again, but reprieved again. For the third Friday in a row, Raif Badawi has escaped the lashes. This, thought to be his first public flogging, and due to be repeated week after week. But there could be a route to freedom. A royal decree has announced the king will pardon some Saudi prisoners. In Canada, where Raif Badawi’s wife has sought asylum, she is appealing to the new Saudi king. TRANSLATION: I wish that the king will issue a pardon for Raif. I wish, hope the Saudi government issues a pardon and issues it as soon as possible because there are children here who are being denied theirfather. Raif Badawi published a website promoting free speech, sometimes critical of religion. With the death of King Abdullah last week, the new Saudi monarch, King Salman, has received a stream of world leaders. The Saudi embassy here is well aware of the spotlight on the kingdom with a new ruler. Prince Charles will visit the country again in ten days’ time. His spokesman will not say whether he will raise human rights issues, only that he is travelling at the request of the British Government and will represent British interests in the region. It would be very good if Prince Charles, who knows the royal family well, if he was to talk about the Raif Badawi situation and to ask the king to stop these appalling floggings. There is support for Raif Badawi’s wife from the journalists at the French magazine Charlie Hebdo. Of course, it is not the same thing, but we can compare because Raif is paying the price for his freedom of speech, as my colleagues also paid the price for their freedom of speech. They were killed for that. But this isn’tjust an isolated case. Other human rights activists have, over the last few years, been imprisoned and are still injail. President Obama did raise the issue of human rights with the new king. But with the Saudis playing a key security and economic role, leaders know they need to work with the kingdom, notjust criticise it. And for the new Saudi king, the dilemma is an old one, balancing the conservative forces with those who want reform. Lucy Manning, BBC News. Now, it used to be the highlight of the Scottish football season, the Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic. For decades the great Glasgow rivals dominated the Scottish top flight. It’s almost three years since the two sides last met, a separation brought about by the liquidation of Rangers in 2012 when they were banished to the bottom division. This weekend the old rivals lock horns once again in the Scottish League Cup, in a hotly anticipated clash. This report contains flash photography. Stars, style and extraordinary success. Rangers once had the lot until one of sport’s most spectacular downfalls. Rangers, one of the giants of world football have been consigned to life among the minnows of the Scottish game. Three years ago, the club was destroyed by debt and banished to the bottom division, and that was just the start. This month has seen more problems, more protests. As the fans prepare to face Celtic again, these are still bitter times. From being a team that was so big. Still we are big, just to drop down, it was heart-breaking to all of us. Angry, disbelief, frustration, they are all in there. I can’t describe how difficult it has been. It is torture, one thing after another. Every day it is something different. And this is now Rangers’ reality. Their recent game at second tier Alloa, in front of 3,000 fans. Many of Rangers’ supporters now have had enough. Last year’s season tickets slumped by 15,000. The club later reported an £8 million loss and this week only a £10 million loan meant they could pay their wages. But now the cup has pitched them against Celtic for the first time since 2012. Celtic won then and some believe in the intervening years, the game has lost. Scottish football, whether people like Rangers or not, has missed them in the Premier Division. The game in Scotland has lost a lot of money. Celtic have dominated in Rangers’ absence but they know the Old Firm is still the biggest draw. Without derbies, football is losing something. I hope and I think it will be peaceful but very much emotions, and that’s a good thing. So, a city will once again be united and divided in football. The waiting is nearly over. Andy Swiss, BBC News, Glasgow. That’s all from us. Now the news where you are. Good evening from BBC London News, I’m Victoria Hollins. Boris johnson’s been criticised, after describing men who join religious extremist groups, such as Islamic State, as losers who are likely to be users of pornography. The Mayor of London told a newspaper that he believes those turning to violence had low self-esteem and were unsuccessful with women. The Tory politician cited an MI5 report into extremism that had compiled psychological profiles of jihadists. But his critics say his analysis is simplistic, vulgar and unhelpful, as Nick Beake reports. British-born jihadis who have declared war on the West. He says they are his biggest concern. He says his police force needs millions more to fight them. He says they’re losers, who can’t get women and are obsessed with pornography. Do you regret using the language you did about Britishjihadis? Not remotely. I don’t think that anybody could seriously contest a word I said. Today the Mayor dropped in on a south London school, where he was supposed to be promoting cleaner air, but some had already condemned him for turning it blue. They said his pornography explanation for radicalisation was crude and irresponsible. It’s an X-rated way of dealing with an A-rated issue, very serious issue, affecting our lives, our national security, our international relations, our communal relations. It cannotjust be distilled down to tabloid-style language that is smutty about sex and about women. But one senior Conservative colleague defended the Mayor’s comments. Boris always uses very colourful language, but he’s right that these people don’t wish us well. We shouldn’t have kind words for them. Borisjohnson said the link between jihadis and pornography was well established and claimed that agents from MI5, based over there, had identified that link in research they had done. Today the Security Service, rather unsurprisingly, wasn’t willing to share that research. He may have had no regrets about his language, but he did clarify his message. It’s symptomatic about a feeling amongst young men, who are led off intojihadi ideology, that they are winners and that the world is against them and that there’s nothing there for me. The answer is to get them into work. Last week Boris johnson visited Iraq and met those leading the fight against so-called Islamic State. Some may welcome his attack on a group, which has murdered so many, but the way he’s done it has certainly raised eyebrows. A growing number of young Londoners are applying to go to university. New figures also show a record number of teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are applying. The Government claims that reforms to how tuition fees are paid have helped to break down barriers to higher education. But critics say certain groups are still being left behind. A former police marksmen has pleaded not guilty to the murder of robbery suspect Azelle Rodney in north London. Mr Rodney, who was 24, died after officers stopped the car he was travelling in with two other men in Edgware in 2005. Anthony Long, a former specialist firearms officer with the Met Police, appeared at Southwark Crown Court. He’s been released on unconditional bail till his trial injune. Easyjet - which has its biggest UK base at Gatwick - has come out in favour of expanding Heathrow Airport. In a submission to the Airports Commission, the budget airline said that expanding Heathrow would be better for passengers. The Church of England is investigating a vicar in Surrey, who’s accused of actively promoting claims that Israel was behind the 9/11 terror attacks. The Reverend Stephen Sizer, who has a history of disputes with jewish community leaders, posted a link on social media to an article blaming the atrocities on Israel. The vicar denies he holds anti-semitic views and has apologised for his actions, as Alex Bushill reports. Let us pray together. As his own website shows, the Reverend Stephen Sizer is used to being the centre of attention. Now he is at the centre of an almighty row, after posting a link to a website accusing Israel of being behind the 9/11 attacks on New York. With a single line, he said, ""Is this anti-Semitic?"" The Board of Deputies of British jews certainly thinks so. ",,

The deepest snow’s fallen in Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland - closing schools and disrupting transport and mobile phone signals.

APPLAUSE And after 35 years, why the famous diplodocus at London’s Natural History Museum is being ousted by a whale. Later on BBC London: The growing war of words over who’s to blame for a week of train delays and cancellations at Farringdon. And it’s certainly getting colder but will we be seeing some snow? We’ll have the full forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Heavy snow has been falling across northern parts of the UK. Hundreds of schools have been closed - and there’s been widespread disruption to roads, rail and air travel. In Northern Ireland, motorists have been warned to stay off the roads. Manchester Airport has been closed for much of the morning as teams try to clear the runways. And the snow has even caused widespread disruption to the mobile phone network. We’ll be hearing from our correspondents in the worse affected areas in a moment, but first, judith Moritz on the day’s snow disruption. Their luggage being loaded, passengers at Manchester Airport had high hopes of taking off. This was the scene through their plane windows and with snow continuing to fall, the runways closed. This flight was heading to America, but it was British snow which stopped them leaving. We were booked to fly on Tuesday. Because of New York, the plane was cancelled and it was rescheduled for today. As well as passengers, pupils have been disrupted today, although the head teacher and caretaker were out clearing the paths. This primary school near Oldham was closed. It is never an easy decision to make, to close the school. We’ve got staff that come in from all over and we have to ensure that it is safe to open the school and it is safe for the children and staff to be here. Normally, there would be 200 children enjoying playtime here, but this is far from the only school with a playground covered in snow. Around the whole of the North of England, 400 schools have closed today because of the weather. Roads have been affected. This was the A6 in Cumbria. At one stage, only one route crossing from east to west of the county was open. The wind added to problems causing snow to drift. Some trans-pennine routes have been closed, too. While you are travelling, the car in front of you, if they brake, your stopping distance is ten times as much as when you are travelling on snow and ice. Of course, it isn’t all doom and disruption. Consett looked more like the Alps this morning with winter sports fans taking full advantage. In a moment, we’ll be hearing from our correspondent in Northern Ireland, Chris Buckler, but first to our Scotland Correspondent, james Cook, who’s in Lochmaben. How is it there? It is cold. It’s picturesque. There has been a lot of snow here, particularly in Dumfries and Galloway. 80 schools are shut down here. We have seen children heading off to go sledging. Some schools closed elsewhere, some across in the Borders and into South Lanarkshire as well. The main routes have been kept open. More than 180 gritters have been out across Scotland. They have managed to keep the arterial routes open. Driving conditions have been difficult. There have been lorries jack-knifed on various routes. But things are still running as normal here. Some children arejust out still running as normal here. Some children are just out enjoying themselves in the snow. Chris Buckler, how much disruption there? There’s been plenty of disruption from last night, when the snow came in. It snowed very heavily in some places overnight, particularly on higher ground. There has been no need for school buses today because over 100 schools have been closed in Northern Ireland, including this one behind me. And simply because of the snow. All of that disruption has all been true particularly on the roads. There is still concern about ice, sleet and snow as well. Infact, some lorries have got stuck on untreated roads and one taxi ended UP untreated roads and one taxi ended up on its roof last night. That is just an example of the kind of difficulties that there have been. When you look at the snow, it does look very nice. The flurries continue to come in. However, the amber warning that warns people to be prepared, it has now gone. We have a yellow warning. That is to be aware of the snow. None the less, it could still cause some problems today. Thank you both very much. And we’ll have the latest on the snow disruption, plus a full weather forecast, later in the programme. The number of under-performing secondary schools in England has more than doubled in a year because of changes in the way exams are marked. The latest performance tables show 40% of pupils didn’t get five good GCSEs, including English and maths. Let’s speak to our education correspondent, Alex Forsyth, who’s at a school in Hampshire. This is one of those schools pleased wits place in the league tables. It’s been improving for the past few years. This year, it’s got its best results yet. Many others have slid down the rankings and that is due to reforms of GCSE and A-levels and, crucially, changes to the way that schools are assessed. Today, we will be looking at these techniques... In the past five years, Havant Academy has become a different school. Its predecessor was rated second worst in England for results in 2010. Since then, it’s been renamed and rebuilt. This year, 50% of students got five good GCSEs. Still below the national average. But its principal is proud of what she sees as rapid progress. There is a role for league tables. There is an element of accountability and in today’s society, you can’t get away from that. Ultimately, it is about providing the best education for young people so that they are able to progress into further education and then on to employment. While this school is creeping up the league tables, many have plummeted. It is not necessarily due to pupils’ poor performance. The Government has changed the criteria on which schools are judged. This year, only a pupil’s first attempt at GCSE exams counts towards a school’s results. That is to prevent multiple resits. Fewer vocational qualifications count. And IGCSEs, similarto vocational qualifications count. And IGCSEs, similar to old O levels, aren’t included in the league tables. The Government says its reforms have introduced more rigour to the system and led to more students choosing academic subjects which employers value. Some head teachers say changing the performance measures, shifting the goalposts, have rendered the league tables useless. A number of schools have slipped down the tables. And heads are very angry about it. It doesn’t reflect the true results of those schools. Those pupils have done a lot better than the tables actually show, so parents really have difficulty seeing the full picture about the school. Labour paints a chaotic picture of the new system, saying it’s caused confusion for parents, but the Government says it should encourage schools to raise standards. I think it is right to stand back and say, ""Why have we made those changes?"" It is about having a rigorous, academic standard in our schools. We need our young people to be prepared for life not only in modern Britain, but to compete with the best in the world. At Havant Academy, they will keep an eye on the league tables in the hope of continued progress. But the real focus here is on what works for the pupils. This state school’s largely unaffected by the league table changes, but some independent schools have found themselves at the bottom because the qualifications they offer no longer count. It’s led some to say if league tables don’t reflect pupils’ performance, how much do they matter and how much can parents trust them when it comes to making choices for their children? An inquest in Sydney has been hearing details of how two hostages died during the siege at a cafe in the city last December. The court heard that the cafe owner, Tori johnson, was murdered by the gunman, Man Horan Monis. His death prompted police to storm the cafe, but during the operation, Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old lawyer, was killed after being hit by fragments from a police bullet. From Sydney, jon Donnison reports. GUNFIRE It is six weeks since the Sydney siege ended in a blaze of gunfire. Australia’s biggest ever antiterrorism operation was over after a 16-hour stand-off. Today, an inquest heard exactly how two of the 18 hostages died. The court was told Tori johnson, the 34-year-old cafe manager, was shot by the gunman Man Haron Monis. Mrjohnson was made by Man Haron Monis to kneel on the floor of the cafe. After a short lapse of time, Mr Monis simply shot him without further notice or warning in the back of his head. That prompted police to storm the building. Monis was shot dead. Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old barrister, was killed not by the gunman, but by police fire. Ms Dawson was struck by six fragments of a police bullet or bullets, which ricocheted from hard surfaces into her body. The Lindt cafe remains boarded up while investigations continue. A few handwritten tributes are a reminder of what unfolded. This inquest should provide the first detailed account of exactly what happened inside the Lindt cafe on the dramatic day in December. Very few of the surviving hostages have talked publicly about the ordeal, but many will be called to give evidence. At least one former hostage, john O’Brien, was in court today. It was upsetting. Very upsetting. For Tori johnson’s family who were sitting there, it’s very emotional. Those who got out alive will likely be the key witnesses in the inquest. The coroner’sjob is not to pass judgment on the police operation. But confirmation that a hostage was killed by police fire will lead some to question how the raid was handled. jon Donnison, BBC News, Sydney. European foreign ministers are to meet in Russia. 30 civilians were killed by shellfire when Russian-backed rebels attacked the port. Ourworld Russian-backed rebels attacked the port. Our world affairs correspondent has the latest. In the bitter depths of midwinter, Ukrainian government forces in the battle-ravaged east of the country. It might not look like it here, but the troops are under pressure again from pro-Russian separatist rebels in a deadly new flare-up in this conflict. So they look for new ways to hinder the rebels. Here, the wreckage from new shelling in one rebel-held city. TRANSLATION: We ran out of the house when we saw fire over there. It was becoming stronger and stronger. We all lay on the ground. This is Donetsk. It is reported at least three civilians died. It is another flashpoint in the new fighting adding to the hardships for the population. This man is saying the shelling just doesn’t stop. He has no more words, he says, but there’s the proof. These are rebel front-line positions, tightening the siege of government forces near one strategic town. Hundreds of pieces of advanced weaponry have crossed the border, so EU ministers are considering extending sanctions against Moscow. Russia denies it is meddling in the crisis. It was the weekend shelling here which left 30 dead that really set off new alarms over this crisis. The worst between Russia and the West since the end of the Cold War. It’s prompted dark warnings of a new Cold War, even, according to the former Soviet President, the risk of a real hot war between Russia and the West. A new wave of refugees from the new fighting, in a conflict that’s already left 5,000 dead and displaced a million or more people from their homes. Our top story this lunchtime: There’ve been heavy snow falls across northern parts of the UK throughout the morning. There’s been widespread disruption to roads, airports and schools. And still to come: Big profits for the oil company Shell, despite the fall in prices. I’ll have all the sport. There’s been a great start for Lee Westwood and Rory Mcllroy at the Dubai Desert Classic. Some of our most serious illnesses occur when genes in the human body go wrong. So scientists are trying to develop a new generation of drugs that isolate then treat the faulty gene. The drugs company AstraZeneca is leading the research and as our science correspondent Pallab Ghosh reports, they’re hailing it as ""one of the biggest developments in the area of biotechnology in decades"". With this profound new knowledge humankind is on the verge of gaining immense new power to heal. A revolution in medical science whose implications far surpass even the discovery of antibiotics. In the year 2000, there were high hopes for the Human Genome Project. But 15 years on there hasn’t been much progress. Now one of the biggest drug programmes in the world believe they’ve found a way to develop the medicines that the Human Genome Project once promised. I think it’s a game changer in how we do biomedical research, both in industry and academia. We have had very precise technology to do exactly what we want to do, so will change fundamentally the process from the last 20 years. The company has joined forces with the nearby Sanger Institute, which was one of the places where human DNA was first decoded. Think of this ivy as a strand of DNA. And the leaves as individual genes. In diseases some of these genes go wrong. The idea of the research project is to snip out some of them and test out different drugs on them to see which one of them solves the problem. Recently researchers have developed molecules that workjust like scissors, here cutting the genes. And the technique is cheap and quick. The potential is huge. We could develop new treatment for heart disease and cancer and diabetes and this is where we can really get the benefit from the Human Genome Project. It’s the first time there has been such a concerted effort to snip out specific disease genes in order to discover new drugs and begin to develop many of the medicines that we’d hoped for after the decoding of the human genome. In the last few minutes the Court of Appeal has a increased the sentence of a man who attacked three sisters in a London hotel last year. Phillips at Benz -- in a London hotel last year. Phillips at Benz -- Philip Spence was given a life sentence with a minimum of 18 years for the attacks. It has been increased to 27 years. Tell us the significance of this and the background to the story? In April this and the background to the story? In the attorney general brought the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing although it was attempted murder a whole life sentence was appropriate. The court has increased the sentence to life with a minimum of 27 years. The falling cost of fuel recently doesn’t seem to have dented the profits of at least one of the big oil companies. Shell says it made more than £2.1 billion in the final quarter of last year. Even so, the company said it was cutting spending to cope with the falling price of oil. They are making more money than 2013. They had a terrible year then. They are making more out of gas and oil. They are cutting £10 billion from investments around the world. That must raise questions about the North Sea. Shall say they can make no guarantees onjobs. North Sea. Shall say they can make no guarantees on jobs. Shell was bullish on the oil price. Not so good for consumers who are trying to fill up their cars. They have said they want to go back into the Arctic to start drilling. The chief executive told me why. The potential in the Arctic is very, very significant. We believe that the Arctic probably holds the largest yet-to-be-discovered resource base. If you look at our position in the Alaska part of the Arctic, in the western Chukchi, it is very substantial indeed. It is kind of hard to take a view on how much would be there, but we are talking about multi-billion barrels whistles potential. 17 leading insurance companies have told the BBC they currently have no plans for any products that will help people plan ahead for care needs in their old age. In 2016, the government is introducing a new £72,000 cap on an individual’s care costs. It was hoped this would lead to insurance companies offering products that people could start paying into long before they needed care. Here’s our social affairs correspondent, Alison Holt. It has got thorns - what must it be? What type of flower has thorns? SHE LAUGHS This woman is 61 and has dementia. Her children looked after her at home, but now her needs are so complex, she’s moved to a care home. It costs £45,000 a year. Her house has been sold to pay for it, but she’s likely to need SUppoIâl foI’ ITI8I’Iy VEBFS. We are facing a real dilemma - do we secure our mother an income for her whole life, which is probably not going to cover her care costs, or do we spend the money now, when it’s most useful to her, and then just hope for the best later on? Speaking to a financial advisor with expertise in the area, it was clear they had little choice. The conclusion I’ve arrived at is that we will take her funds and invest them, and frankly, run them down. And I can’t see them lasting much more than six or seven years. Next year the Government will introduce a new £72,000 cap to limit the care costs that some people face. The idea is that the cap will protect people against what are often called catastrophic costs. The other hope was that it would encourage insurance companies to come up with new products aimed at protecting people. The BBC asked leading insurance companies if they had plans for pre-funded care products. 17 responded. There were no plans for 2016, or even for 2019. Say you wanted to sell a product like that to somebody in their 30s or 40s, well, they have other priorities - they will be thinking about paying off their mortgage and supporting their children. So, to sell a product which is specifically about social care needs much later in life I think would be extremely hard. Insurers maintain they ARE looking at other, more flexible retirement policies. But the Government says this is a challenge the industry needs to meet, as it has a responsibility to help people plan ahead.

Malaysia has officially declared the disappearance of flight MH370 as an accident- saying there were no survivors. The plane disappeared last March with 239 passengers and crew on board. The declaration will now allow compensation payments to be claimed by relatives of the victims. An air-sea search operation has resumed in the English Channel for a missing Belgian-flagged trawler with four crew on board. Lifeboat and helicopter crews were stood down early this morning following a thorough search for the vessel which vanished in rough seas and gale-force winds. Andy Murray is through to the final of the Australian Open. He beat the Czech, Tomas Berdych, in three sets - despite losing the first set on a tie-break. He’ll face either Novak Djokovic or Stan Wawrinka in Sunday’s final. Here’s our sports correspondent, joe Wilson. Tennis is a simple game. just listened to the umpire. It is up to five sets. That’s clear then. When it comes to pronouncing the name of his opponent, Thomas Berdych is unmistakable, six and wallops it. COMMENTATOR: That is powerful tennis from Thomas Berdych.

If you’ve ever walked into the main hall at London’s Natural History Museum there’s one exhibit you won’t have missed - the giant skeleton of a dinosaur which has towered over visitors for more than three decades. Now it’s being replaced by the skeleton of a blue whale. Richard Lister reports. DippV’$ Dippy’s days as a gatekeeper are numbered. The museum plans to replace this dinosaur with something even bigger to greet the 5 million people who visit each year. This is how the entrance hall will look into macro years, with a blue whale skeleton. Animals are museum hopes will encourage mute -- visitors to think of the future as well as the past. The blue whale is at the edge of extinction. We have managed to pull that back, it demonstrates a whole range of things that we as a museum are doing with our research. Wales have featured in the entrance hall before. The plan is to have Dippv hall before. The plan is to have Dippy tour the country before returning to the dinosaur collection. Many will miss her. A change is as good as a rest. Why should everything be centred in London? Now there is a chance that Dippy the diplodocus could come to a town near you for the first time. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today - heavy snow has been causing disruption across Northern Ireland, Scotland and Northern England. Although there’s been good news for Andy Murray in Australian, there’s not-so-good news domestically for those who run swimming. Sport England have revealed the number of people swimming for at least half an hour per week has dropped significantly, alongside a drop in participation overall. Our reporter, David Ornstein, is here to tell us more about Sport England’s ‘Active People Survey’. We are almost three years on from the London Olympics where the legacy was to inspire a generation. With these results, that doesn’t appear to be happening across-the-board. The overall figures for participation in England once a week for 30 minutes are down by 125,000 and the Sports Minister has suggested there could be quite significant funding cuts if those participation levels aren’t increased. The key headline here is swimming, which has lost 250,000 participants over the last year. There’s been strong criticism from Sport England. We will come on to that in a moment. There is also a problem with the gender gap. It remains at1.75 problem with the gender gap. It remains at 1.75 million. Fewer women than men participating in sport. The number of disabled people is also down by 122,000 participants since last year. I’m disappointed the overall figures have come down a bit. We are clear what is driving that. It is the drop in swimming participation because particularly for older people, if they swim, that tends to be all they do, so they stop being active if they are not swimming. If we can drive up the number of people who swim it will make a huge difference. There is some good news today for the funding in three other sports? There is. First, let’s point to a few team sports. They have seen some growth in football, rugby and cricket. Three sports - table tennis, tennis and fencing had their funding restricted in 2013. It was still restricted in 2014. Now, those restrictions have been lifted because they have shown signs of progress, increased participation. They have appointed new Chief Executives and they are going in the right direction. Swimming, at this point, is not. Thank you. 'Anything can happen’ when Tottenham play Chelsea in the League Cup final on March the 1st - that’s the optimistic view of the Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino after his side’s 3-2 aggregate win over Sheffield United last night. It wasn’t easy - United came back from 1-0 down on the night to lead 2-1, with both goals scored by teenage substitute Che Adams, but a late Christian Eriksen goal - his second of the evening - rescued a 2-2 draw for Spurs and a first League Cup final since they beat Chelsea back in 2008. To golf - and The Dubai Desert Classic - where Lee Westwood is one shot behind the current leaders Peter Uhilein and Bernd Veesberger as the first round draws to a close. Westwood and fellow Englishman Andy Sullivan and Belgium’s Nicolas Colsaerts are all on 7-under par. Westwood kept a bogey-free card and birdied his last two holes. World number one Rory Mcllroy is just one shot behind - in a group including the defending champion, Scotland’s Stephen Gallacher. Mcllory has finished second in his last three events but is back at the place he won his first professional tournament, six years ago. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. More now on our main story - the heavy snow that has been falling throughout the morning across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. Let’s get the latest from our correspondent, judith Moritz, who’s in Delph. What is the situation now? Well, the primary school here remains closed and there are still more than 400 schools around the whole of the North of England which are shut. Good news for passengers at Manchester Airport which has been suffering this morning with closures. They are now back up and running. There will be some delays. I have been hearing from passengers on board the planes saying they are starting to deice. The Highways Agency tell us this has been their busiest day for two years. In terms of the road network, well the roads are being gritted here wherever possible, the A-roads, the A62 between Greater Manchester and over to Yorkshire is up and running, the M62 is running as well. What Oldham Council tell us is, they are fairly typical of any local authority, they are used to this sort of weather in winter. They know they have to keep going 24 hours a day to keep up with it. So, they say they have had their gritters out now doing split 12-hour shifts, they have pulled in litter pickers to come in and grit the roads so the hope is that by tomorrow, it should be getting back to normal. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Tomasz Schafernaker. We can tell you roughly where the snow is going to be falling over the next few days. It is a very volatile situation because these bands of snow tend to be very hit-and-miss. That will still remain the case for the next few days. It is an all-or-nothing situation. This is an example of where we had a bit of snow in Northern Ireland. So, some pretty nasty conditions there. And you are going to have to keep track of the weather forecast. The details of where these pockets of snow are, that keeps changing with every prediction. At the moment, this is the satellite picture. You can see there is this distinct band of snow- bearing there is this distinct band of snow-bearing cloud, or cloud-bearing snow- bearing cloud, or cloud- bearing snow-bearing cloud, or cloud-bearing snow - which ever way round that is! From Manchester, through Nottinghamshire, that is where the snow will ease a bit. Some of the snow showers will sink further south into southern Britain. Another area where the snow is going to ease a little bit through this evening is Scotland and Northern Ireland. They will still continue for sure. There will still be a fresh covering in places. They won’t be quite so heavy. I mentioned some in the south. There could be a covering on the cards almost anywhere across the Midlands and the south. We are not anticipating a particularly thick covering of snow here. Of course, with clear skies - this is air from over the north-west Atlantic, it is very cold, and there is some ice as well. Now, the temperatures will be more or less the same across the bulk of the country, so round about freezing. The thing about Friday is, it’s actually going to turn just a fraction milder, but it really will be just a fraction. We’ve got milder air nudging in from the Atlantic, so we are calling it mostly sleet, maybe snow across the hills. You can see temperatures of 5-7 Celsius for Friday. That is the one day, where those temperatures will bump up a little bit. Then on Saturday, what happens is - see these lines? This is where the winds follow the isobars. The wind is coming from the Arctic. Look how the temperatures have dropped. When we get winds from the north, it is the western extremity and the eastern extremity that gets clipped by the snow showers. So, notjust the weekend, but right into Monday and Tuesday we could get a little bit of snow. The next chance of potentially a bit of snow heading our way, maybe Wales, the South West of England, that could be early next week. It is still a chance. You will have to keep in touch with the weather forecast to stay one step ahead of the snow. Thank you. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Heavy snow has been causing disruption across Scotland, Northern Ireland and England. Hundreds of schools have been closed. All flights in-and-out of Manchester Airport were suspended this morning, but the airport in the last few minutes has said that it is now operational and planes are starting to move again. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Katharine Carpenter. Thames Water has hit back at suggestions it’s to blame for the flooding of a railway tunnel at Farringdon - saying poor maintenance by Network Rail has caused the problem. Commuters have suffered a week of delays and around a thousand trains have been cancelled. With the latest on the growing row over who’s responsible, here’s Tarah Welsh. This is the seventh day of delays and cancellations for passengers because of flooded tracks. It’s also turned into a war of words with the two big companies involved. Last night, Network Rail said that Thames Water faced a multi-million pound compensation bill. This all started because a water main burst on to the tracks on Friday and flooded the tracks in Clerkenwell tunnel. On Sunday, Thames Water stopped the burst pipe and the line re-opened on Tuesday. Last night, it had to be closed again. Water was still causing signal problems. Thames Water said the draining system was blocked. Last night, they cleared it out claiming Network Rail had neglected it because debris, litter had built up inside leaving the water with nowhere to go. They also say that Network Rail were warned about this in 2007. The good news for passengers is, they seem to have identified the problem and one thing everyone involved does agree on, they want to get people moving as soon as possible. The capital’s police chief has been outlining how the force has reassessed security in the wake of the Paris terror attacks earlier this month. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that he was reviewing the number of armed officers on London’s streets. One option is to train more members of the Territorial Support Group as reserve firearms officers. There is no doubt that as the French found, these are very challenging incidents, it is very difficult if someone is moving around with a gun. We do have plans already, but we have refined them in consequence of what we discovered of the French experience. Bus workers are planning three more 24-hour strikes next month. Backed by the union Unite, they’re campaigning for drivers at different companies to be paid the same. Transport for London says that would cost around £100 million a year and lead to cuts. A strike earlier this month saw only a third of buses running. Crossrail workers have finished tunnelling under the city. The machine broke into the new Liverpool Street hub 40 metres under ground. It means more than 60% of the project is now complete and the tunnelling team is now on its way to Farringdon. A man from Croydon has sold a Star Wars figurine for £18,000. The figure cost £1.50 when it came out 35 years ago. Now the weather with Alena jenkins. Some very cold conditions over the next few days. This afternoon is no exception. We have a yellow warning from the Met Office for some snow, but also for some ice and this warning is valid through the rest of the day, overnight and first thing tomorrow. The showers have been developing to the west and north-west of us. You can see on the earlier satellite and radar picture. Some cloud starting to feed towards us, so there is a chance that we will see some showers through the afternoon. Always a little bit hit-and-miss but some slight accumulations of snow are possible, but also some sleet, some rain, maybe some hail and all the while feeling cold, highs of 5-6 Celsius. There will be further showers for a time through this evening, then a lull and some clearer spells, some ice on untreated surfaces. Temperatures close to freezing. The odd pocket of frost. As I mentioned, some ice on untreated surfaces. It ",,

Ministers insist tougher standards will improve education, but some heads say the new system is completely unfair. It doesn’t represent what we did with our students and what the students achieved themselves. We’ll be asking whether the government’s changes present a truer picture of our schools’ performance.

On BBC London: The Met Commissioner calls for more money to keep the capital safe from the threat of terrorism. And Thames Water blames Network Rail for the disruption facing Thameslink passengers for a seventh day. armed officers on the beat. Scots sweep aside the snow disruption that has left some schools closed. Good evening. The number of under-performing secondary schools in England has more than doubled in a year- after changes to the exam system. League tables out today show 330 schools failed to reach the benchmark of Ao per cent of pupils getting five good GCSEs including Maths and English. That’s up from 154 last year. It comes after ministers toughened exams, banned re-sits, and excluded some vocational qualifications from performance tables. Our Education Correspondent Alex Forsyth is in Havant, in Hampshire. This is a school that was pleased with its place in the league tables. We spent a day with staff and students who went home a little earlier proud of the progress they have made. At many schools have slipped back. Some headteachers have questioned whether the criteria on which they are judged is a fair reflection of their pupil’s performance. In the past five years, this academy has literally become a different school. It spread assessor -- the predecessor had the second worst results in England in 2010. Since then, it has been renamed and rebuilt and last year, half the students got five good GCSEs. The lowly average but a record results. Pupils said the improvement is obvious. At the start of seventh year, people did not want to go here copper it was last choice, but the way it has developed... People would not send their child there and now they really want to send their child here. That has had a big impact on the reputation of the school. The school principal says claiming the league tables is a welcome side-effect of improving attainment. There is an element of accountability and you cannot get away from that but ultimately, it is about providing the best education for young people. But while this school is progressing, many others have slipped down the league tables, not necessarily because of poor performance. The government has changed the criteria on which schools are judged. This year, only a first attempt at GCSE exam will count the results. That is to stop multiple resits. Fewer vocational qualifications count. The government says this means more students are taking academic subjects which employers value but some headteachers say these changes render the league tables useless. This school got its second best GCSE results but it is not reflected in the tables because some pupils to reset -- the tables because some pupils to reset -- took resits. We have had the best results ever but according to the data it is down because it is based on the first entry policy. It does not represent what the students achieved. Labour says the system is heading for chaos and confusion but the government insists it will drive UP the government insists it will drive up standards. It is about having rigorous academic standards in our schools because we need our young people to be prepared for life, to compete with the best in the world. Back at the academy they will keep an eye on league tables but the real focus is on what works for the pupils. The government recognises its reforms have caused a dip in performance tables but it says that will bed in overtime. The question is whether amid this followed till it a parents will trust the league tables when it comes to making important choices about their children’s schooling. There is a full list of the league tables on the BBC News website. The families of japanese The families ofjapanese and jordanian hostage being held by Islamic State have made personal appeals for their safe return. The messages were issued as a deadline came and went. The fate of the hostages is still unclear. jordan is ready to swap a prisoner for its captured fighter pilot, but Islamic State will only free the japanese hostage in return. The Turkish border with Syria, where Islamic State have demanded jordan hand over a failed suicide bomber. The japanese media have gathered, hoping to see their country’s hostage released in turn, but the deadline has passed with no handover. Kenji Goto is a respected japanese journalist. His wife revealed she has been in e-mail contact with his kidnappers. She made this heartfelt appeal. Also being held is thisjordanian pilot. His plane came down over Syria. jordan wants him back and is willing to give up the suicide bomber in exchange, at Islamic State are only offering to release the japanese hostage. His father has made this appeal. I ask you in the name of God and his prophet and all the believers and the names of tens of millions injordan and Palestine to release my son, who is your brother in religion. The jihadists of Islamic State have not been swayed by such appeals in the past. They won’t even offer proof that he is alive and their demand for release of the bomber is unusual. What is it about the Iraqi woman causing Islamic State to demand her release? She is a failed suicide bomber, captured with an explosive belt that did not detonate. She was part of an Al-Qaeda attack ten years ago that killed nearly 60 people, and is linked to this dead leader of Al-Qaeda, who is seen as the forerunner of Islamic State. This is placing a heavy burden on jordan’s King Abdullah. If either hostages killed, many will blame him and his government instead of Islamic State. Britain has summoned the Russian ambassador to ask him to explain why military aircraft came close to UK airspace yesterday. It forced authorities to divert civil aircraft. This happened yesterday. Two Russian bombers, in itself not unusual, going close to Scotland. What was interesting was the flight path. They came round the British Isles, up through the British Channel, then turned round. They came within 25 miles of the UK mainland. They were shadowed by RAF Typhoon is throughout theirjourney but did not file a flight plan. They did not have the transponder on and were not speaking to a air-traffic control. Clearly, when you come close to UK airspace there is a lot of air-traffic and there was this rupture in. That is why the ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Office. There has been an increase in Russian military activity but these bombers did not enter UK airspace at any time. Heavy snow has been falling across northern parts of the UK. Hundreds of schools have been closed - and there’s been widespread disruption to roads, rail and air travel. Manchester Airport was closed for several hours, and in Northern Ireland drivers have been warned to stay off the roads. judith Moritz is in Oldham for us. judith.

The neighbouring areas tell us they have worked through 750 tonnes -- neighbouring areas tell us they have worked through 750 tonnes -- 750,000 tonnes of grit. With the snow continuing to fall, we are not out of the woods. The beauty is breathtaking. The snow sports are spectacular. But for some, the inconvenience has been incredible. In the north-west, whether you’re trying to drive or take off, the snow got in the way. At Manchester Airport, the runways closed, with flights rounded. It is booked to fly on Tuesday but because of New York, the plane was cancelled. It was rescheduled for today. As well as passengers, pupils were also disrupted. This head teacher and pupil were clearing the path. It is never easy to make the decision to close the school but we’ve got staff that come in from all over and obviously we’ve got to make sure it is safe to open the school and for children and staff to be here. Normally there would be 200 children enjoying playtime here but this is far from the only school in the playground covered in snow. Around the whole of the North of England, around 1+00 schools have closed the cause of the weather. In Scotland, at jack knifed Lawrie added to delays on the a 75 in Dumfries. -- truck. In Northern Ireland, the traffic was moving. In northern England there has been a constant drive to keep gritting but even the best efforts have not stopped delays on the roads.

The Ministry ofjustice says a member of staff has been suspended. Fewer than a 100 cases of the Ebola virus were confirmed in West Africa last week, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures. It’s the lowest number of cases since june. But scientists in France who are tracking the outbreak say the virus could be mutating. Our Global Health Correspondent Tulip Mazumdar has been to Paris to find out more. From infected Ebola patients in Guinea, to some of the world’s most advanced laboratories here in Paris. Scientists are analysing this genetic material from the virus that has been made safer for them to study. They are trying to find out why this outbreak has killed so many. One possible answer- the virus is mutating, but it is unclear how. We have seen several cases that do not have any symptoms. We call them asymptomatic cases. These people may be the ones that can spread the virus later, we still do not know that yet. The virus can change itself from more deadly into less deadly, but more contagious, and that is something we are afraid. One concern is Ebola could eventually become airborne, but there is no evidence to suggest it is happening. It is still only passed through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. As a scientist, you cannot predict things will change. For the moment, there is mutation but the behaviour of the virus in humans is approximately the same. Researchers are using this method of genetic sequencing to track changes in the genetic make-up of the virus. It will also give them a clear insight into why some people survive and others don’t, which in turn will help develop vaccines. Here, scientists are trying to modify the measles vaccine so it can be used to protect against Ebola. We are going to have another infectious outbreak at some point because the reservoirs, the places where the virus hides in nature, be it in small animals, in other contexts, is still a threat for humans in the future. As the number of new infections continues to fall to some of the lowest levels seen in this crisis, researchers are trying to use the remainder of the outbreak to learn all they can about the virus.

And Andy Murray with a convincing win over Thomas Berdych. For most people a key or a security pass is enough to get into the office. But now, a Swedish firm is offering an alternative for workers - a chip inserted into the hand, under the skin. As well as access to the building, staff will be able to use it to print things and to pay for their lunch at the cafe. Our Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan-jones went to Stockholm to test it out himself. Stockholm and a nondescript building has been converted into a high-tech office space. But look under the skin to find something futuristic. This man does not need a pass to get in. And then another swipe of the hand for access to the office. What is going on? I have a chip implant. That is why the doors let me in. Where is it? It is inside here. Contact details. I think it can do a lot of other stuff in the future. The new offices will soon host a shifting population of 700 entrepreneurs and employees and they will all be offered the chance to get chipped if they wish. As well as opening doors it will allow them to use the photocopiers and in future log onto computers or pay for food in the cafe. I think it is only fair in the interests of research I am chipped. I am told it will not hurt, but I have reservations about it. Let’s go. We are done. The technology is still having teething problems. I found it a struggle to activate the photocopier. And among the people working here, I found some enthusiasm, but also caution. At the moment I will not be chipped. Because I do not feel it is necessary for opening doors, or connecting with machines. Can I get your contacts? The man behind the scheme whose business card can be accessed via his chip, said the aim is to learn lessons. We want to be able to understand this technology before big corporates and governments come to us and say, hey, everyone should get chipped, the tax authority chip, or the Google chip or Facebook chip. Another feature of this unconventional office, dogs are welcome. I have been chipped, have you? While we’re used to having our pets chipped, putting technology under our own skin may be a step too far. New figures from the energy watchdog Ofgem show that the UK’s big energy suppliers expect to make more money per customer in the coming 12 months than last year. That’s despite recent price cuts to gas tariffs, and a dramatic fall in the price of crude oil. Industry correspondent john Moylan is here. john, this is going to raise eyebrows, what sort of profits are we talking about here? Recently we have seen price cuts from big firms of between 3% and 5% but this analysis suggests the profits of those firms might rise sharply and Ofgem analysed and suggests that in the next 12 months average profits per customer would be around £111+, which is a big rise. At that time they said it would be £105. Why is this happening? Ofgem said the costs the companies are seeing are falling and the wholesale gas and electricity in particular. The industry was biting back today, rubbishing the figures and saying the analysis was outdated and inaccurate. But politicians and consumer groups seized on the numbers as evidence that falling wholesale costs are allowing the firms to increase profits at a time of fairly modest cuts in energy prices. Nearly a quarter of a million fewer people are swimming regularly compared to last year. That’s a drop of around 8 per cent. It’s thought to be the main reason behind an overall fall in numbers taking part in sport. It’s a blow to campaigners, who had high hopes that the Olympics would encourage more of us to get active. Natalie Pirks has been taking a look at the numbers. Whether it is for health reasons or just the much-needed quiet time, swimming has long been the nation’s most popular participation sport but now the number of those doing it regularly is sinking fast. The governing body is determined to do better, but they might have to do it with less funds. They want to address it and I want to work with them but we have to send a message the figures are not good enough. It is likely they will have funding cuts? There will be hard conversations. Youth participation is up but there was cause for concern chiefly among minority groups. And there are fewer disabled people playing sport regularly. The gender gap has widened. 125,000 fewer women exercised in the past year and the fewer women exercised in the past yearand the number of fewer women exercised in the past year and the number of those on the lowest incomes who plays sport has seen a massive drop. Sport England believes the recent campaign will help to inspire women to get active in time for the next set of results but there is a suggestion sports like swimming suffer from the government austerity cuts. People are not going swimming as much. Some of that has to be nobody has any money. It is important to exercise and it is important it is affordable. The man who delivered the London Olympics believes the government needs a holistic approach. It is not uniquely a health problem, it is about transportation, the inner-city, safety. For too long we have looked at it as a health problem. Might Accra but it will be for the nation if future figures do not improve. Britain’s Andy Murray is through to the final of the Australian Open. He came from behind to beat Tomas Berdych three sets to one. It’s the fourth time he’s reached the final in Melbourne, although he’s yet to win it. joe Wilson reports. Tennis is a simple sport, just listen to the umpire. UMPIRE SPEAKS RAPIDLY. That’s clear, then! Well, actions speak louder than words. We had plenty of both here. Thomas Berdych belligerent, Andy Murray retrieving the unreachable. Oh, he’s got it! Intensity smouldered, meaningful looks exchanged. Some Czech chat, too. The first set took an hour and 16 minutes. Tie-break. Murray’s mistake. First set to Thomas Berdych. Murray took out his frustration on his opponent. He was rampant in the second set, winning it 6-0. All in black, he was the ball’s shadow, pouncing to take the third set 6-3 and now Berdych was a man on the brink. The fourth set was tight, but Murray didn’t crumble and took it 7-5. Who was Murray pointing out to give credit for his superb tennis? How about his coach, Amelie Mauresmo? A lot of people criticised me working with her. I think so far this week we have shown that women can be very good coaches as well. Murray’s fiancee Kim Sears expressed her passion. Lip readable here, far earthier earlier. Murray is showing his mean side just when it matters. Now, it took two decades to paint, and has been described as the Sistine Chapel of the UK. But now the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich is in need of a bit of a touch-up. It’s getting its first major restoration for over half a century, and our Arts Editor Will Gompertz went to see what lies ahead. The old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, designed by Sir Christopher Wren around 1698. It is an architectural masterpiece from the outside and an artistic one inside. This is the Painted Hall. Decorated byjames Thornhill with a brief to show off Britain’s superiority. King William and Queen Mary stare down triumphantly from above with Louis XIV of France trampled beneath their feet. He is down at heel, rather like the ceiling itself. The Painted Hall started life as a dining room for Navy veterans, who, the story goes, weren’t beyond having the occasional food fight, some of the remnants of which are supposed to have stained the ceiling. I cannot see evidence of that but I can see it could do with some restoration. A multi-million-pound renovation is planned, but first, an evaluation must be made of the artwork’s current condition. We have a problem with surface accumulation of dust and grime, as one might imagine. But also surface deterioration of previous coatings applied in the 1950s. Here are those 1950s conservators at work, using techniques that would not wash today. They were talented, but the techniques they used were rather insensitive. 15 layers of varnish removed using solvent and a new varnish layer applied. Today the approach is different, it is understanding what is going on and making sure any intervention now does not affect the paintings in a negative way in the future. The Painted Hall is often hired out as a film location as a way of raising money, which as a free to visit tourist attraction is needed. Everyone has to do their bit, even Sirjames Thornhill, the revered painter of the Hall. Time for a look at the weather. A lot of beautiful landscapes have been painted today with the wintry scene across much of the northern half of the UK. A typical picture from Glasgow earlier. Glasgow may see more of the snow in the next few hours. If you do not get it, it could be slippery on the roads. It potentially could turn icy. Some sunshine today, but you can see where the showers have been. Several centimetres of snow is possible as it moves through this evening, spreading to Wales and eventually southern England, but here, mainly a dusting at low levels. Gusty winds around the coasts of South Wales and southern England. It could be slippery in the morning. Temperatures dropping close to freezing. It could be icy. But, tomorrow, not as much snow around. Showers chiefly of rain and sleet. There will be plenty of showers across northern Scotland. In the central belt, there should be some blue sky. Snow showers in Northern Ireland and parts of northern England. Furthersouth, not too Ireland and parts of northern England. Further south, not too many showers in the afternoon. Temperatures will be a touch higher, but it will still feel cold because of the bitter wind, which is with us throughout the weekend. Turning colder on Saturday. Likely to see more in the way of snow. Showers at low levels will be of rain. On Sunday, we repeat it. The cold wind but maybe a little bit more sunshine on Sunday. Not as much snow, but staying wintry. A reminder of our main story. The number of secondary schools underperforming in England doubles. We nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you are.

And under threat once more - the Natural History Museum reveals that Dippy’s days are numbered as the Great Hall’s star attraction. Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. The head of the Metropolitan Police says he needs tens of millions of pounds of extra funding to protect London from the threat of terrorism. Speaking at City Hall in the wake of the Paris attacks, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the increasing use of online networks was taking up ITIOFE FESOUFCES li’I8I’I EVEI’. And the Commissioner also revealed that the force is having success in preventing more youngsters from travelling to Syria to fight with Islamic State. Nick Beake reports. Protecting London from terrorism has often been highly visible. But now more and more time and money is being spent fighting those plotting attacks radicalising others online. Today, with a different and increasing threat, the commissioner said his counterterrorism teams need much more funding to keep us safe. We are talking about a significant number of resources. We do not reveal that figure publicly but it is in the tens of millions that we think we need. The TARDIS attacks were bloody reminders of the threat European Capitals face. -- the attacks in Paris were bloody reminders. The Deputy Mayor for policing says it is a scandal that London’s police force is not getting sufficient extra funding. They do this surveillance work, and it is important that counterterrorism policing gets Ashya of additional money. 20 million is a good friend number. The National counterterrorism budget this year ‘s £561+ million. The Prime Minister has promised an extra 130 million. A larger motor is not to be going to the Security Service. The Deputy Mayor claims of police will only get £9.1+ million of that part. One of the reasons London faces an increased terror threat these days is from returning fighters from the Middle East. Today the Mayor said he was encouraged that more parents in the past months have been coming forward to police to say that their children were at risk of being radicalised. That, he said, gave his offers us an increased chance of stopping them going out to Syria and the first place. But it is a constant battle. The Home Office told us that the extra counterterrorism funding had not been finalised but insisted it will ensure the police and other agencies have the resources needed to respond to changing threats.

Tonight on BBC London: The Metropolitan Police Commissioner says he needs millions of pounds more to protect Londoners from terrorism. And claims that billions of pounds is being laundered through the City every day. Good evening. The fate of two hostages - a jordanian pilot, and a japanese journalist- being held by Islamic State extremists is unclear tonight. jordan has demanded proof that their man is still alive before they agree a prisoner swap. They’ve been preparing to trade an Iraqi Al-Qaeda prisoner in exchange for the pilot. Earlier today the wife of the japanese journalist made a personal appeal for his safe return. Our Middle East correspondent Yolande Knell sent this report from Amman. Another torturous day of waiting for the father of the jordanian fighter pilot captured last month. Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh was shot down over northern Syria during the bombing campaign against Islamic state. Tonight appeals were made to the militants as fellow Muslims to set him free. TRANSLATION: Forgiveness is a quality of the prophet. If all path blocked, if you forgive your brother, the response will be very positive from alljordanians. positive from all jordanians. Twice positive from alljordanians. Twice IS threatened to kill the pilot and a japanese hostage if jordan did not meet their demands by sunset. Supporters stood anxiously as darkness fell. Members of the jordanian pilot’s extended family have been meeting here in the past few days to share their moments of hope and fear, but now, after two deadlines have passed for a prisoner deal to be done, the mood has turned to anguish and anger. And jordanian officials worry public opposition is now hardening against their involvement in the coalition fighting Islamic state. The suffering of Moaz al-Kasasbeh is not directing things in the path of being more supportive of this war against Isis. On the contrary, it is making things worse for the regime and for the government. More and more the calls have been forjordan to lead this alliance. During the hostage ordeal, a man has made an offer to exchange this Iraqi woman, Sajida al-Rishawi, with the extremists. She wasjailed for her part in a series of hotel bombings here in 2005 which killed nearly 60 people. And there have also been negotiations to try to free the japanese journalist, negotiations to try to free the japanesejournalist, Kenji japanese journalist, Kenji Goto, seen here before he was caught by IS in October. Tonight, his wife made a heartfelt plea for his release. It was here on the Turkish border with Syria that Islamic state wanted jordan to hand over its prisoner. The media were on stand-by, hoping to see hostages freed and returned. But a night that prospect looks much dimmer. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner is with me. Now that this latest deadline has passed, what do you make of the strategy of IS now? I’m sorry to say I think they’re playing a very clever game. I don’t think they are very genuinely concerned as to whether they get this woman, Sajida al-Rishawi, before. They have never asked for her before, she has been imprisoned for ten years. She is of no strategic value to them, she is purely embolic value because she is one of the founders, the forerunners to IS today. She is close to their ideology. I think instead what they are up to very successfully is undermining the coalition, the US led coalition. They are weakening jordan’s support for these air strikes. They are going over their heads of the rulers, the King Abdullah and his government, appealing to people, showing how unpopular that war is, and of course this is a rot which wants it sets in could affect other countries like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE, all taking part in this, so whether or not the hostages survived, it has certainly caused some damage to the coalition against Islamic state. Thank you. The number of secondary schools in England judged to be underperforming has more than doubled since the Government changed the exam system. The latest league tables show that more than 330 schools didn’t achieve the benchmark of 40% or more pupils receiving five good GCSE grades. That’s up from 154 last year. But ministers says it’s been right to make exams more academically rigorous and to change the way the league tables are compiled, as our correspondent Alex Forsyth reports. League tables were designed to paint a picture of school performance across England. But this year, there are questions over their validity. At this academy, results have improved dramatically over five years. And while its principal welcomes the rise in the ranks, to her, it is a side-effect of pupils and their attainment. There is a role for league tables and for accountability, and in to take’s society you cannot get away from that, but ultimately it is about finding the best education for young people. -- finding the best education for young people. -- in today’s society. Well the school is making progress, others have slipped back. It is not this is their lead you to a sliding pupils’ performance that others have slipped back. The 007 change the criteria on which schools are judged. This year, only a pupil’s first attempt in an exam will count towards the school’s results. -- first attempt in an exam will count towards the school’s results. -- the Government changed the criteria. The Government says this means more students are taking academic subjects which employers value. But some headteachers say these changes render the league tables useless. While this Cambridge school got its second best GCSE results, that is not reflected in the tables because some pupils took resits and only their first exam entry counts. We’ve had our two best years of GCSE results. But according to the data this morning it is down at 57%, but thatis this morning it is down at 57%, but that is based on the first entry policy, so it doesn’t represent what we did with our students and what the students achieve themselves. Labour has said the system is heading for chaos and some teaching unions have suggested schools publish their own data. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not have comparable league tables. But in England, the Government views a central system of performance measurement as essential. It is all about having rigorous academic standards in our schools because we need our young people to be prepared for life not only in modern Britain but to compete with the best in the world. The Government is confident its reforms will bed in, making league tables more consistent in future, but some still question whether the parents will trust this year’s results and making choices about their child’s future. England’s biggest hospitals are refusing to approve their annual budget deal with the NHS, claiming that the cuts involved would mean they could no longer guarantee the safe care of patients. Our health editor Hugh Pym has more details. He’s at St Mary’s Hospital in London. What can you tell us about the state of play? Well, leading hospitals like this one around England have been told the amount of money they will get for the next financial year beginning in April by NHS England is not going to be enough to keep up with expected patient demand. It is the so-called tariff they are paid for carrying out procedures and looking after patientss and they are saying if the plan goes ahead they just went be able to guarantee an appropriate level of patient care. -- they will not be able. So the motion has been taken off the table and it is not clear what will happen next. The Budget has a ready been set by the Government so any more money would have to come from other bits of the health service and, as one NHS official put it today, it would be like robbing Peter to pay Paul. So a row, it seems, will continue on these lines. It is not clear how it will work out and the very fact that is happening at the highest levels of the NHS tells you just how financially stretched the system is right now. Thank you, Hugh. Information from three of Britain’s most sensitive official inquiries, including two fatal shootings by police, has gone missing in the post. The Government confirmed that documents about the Mark Duggan, Azelle Rodney and Robert Hamill inquiries have been lost since early this month. The Ministry ofjustice says a member of staff has been suspended. In Mexico City, a mother and a child have died in a gas explosion that destroyed a maternity ward at a city hospital. Mobile phone images captured the moment of the blast which was caused by a leak from a tanker delivering liquid gas to the hospital. Authorities say 66 people were injured including nine babies, who were taken to other hospitals. The oil giant Shell is reviving its plans to drill for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace and other critics are accusing the company of taking a massive risk in one of the world’s most important marine environments. Shell’s chief executive accepted that drilling in the Arctic divided opinion, but he said the world needed new sources of oil. Our business editor Kamal Ahmed has more details. It is one of the most delicate environments in the world. Today, Shell said that such was the growing demand for energy that it wanted to restart exploring for oil in the Arctic. Controversial, yes, but when I met the chief executive, he insisted that it was necessary. The potential in the Arctic is very significant. We believe that the Arctic probably holds the largest yet to be discovered resource base. It’s hard to take a view on how much will be there, but we are talking about multi-billion barrel resource potential. But many say the Arctic is the last great wilderness and all companies should not be there. I know it is a difficult issue. It is an issue that divides society quite a bit. I don’t think we will ever be able to convince everybody that this is the right thing to do. Shell has already faced legal charges in the Arctic, and a rig did run aground in 2012. The next year, it announced a two-year pause in its Alaskan project. Now critics say the oil giant should never come back. Shell is placing one of the most important marine areas in the world at terrible risk, while planning to add more hydrocarbons to the atmosphere at a time when we desperately need to ratchet down our CO2 emissions. With the oil price falling, Shell announced that it would cut £10 billion worth of non-Arctic investment. That will raise fresh concerns about the North Sea, which, as a mature field, is an expensive place to drill for oil and gas. Can you guarantee that there will be no more job cuts and scaling back of your activity in the North Sea over the next five years? I don’t think there are any guarantees in life, and also not in this respect. The North Sea is a tough place. It is tough for explorers and producers, but it’s also economically a tough place. It just got tougher. The Shell chief executive said that even though the oil price was likely to start rising again, the Government should step in and help the North Sea, possibly with tax cuts in the Budget in March. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. The European Union is to extend the sanctions against Russia which were imposed last year in response to the crisis in Ukraine. Fighting there has intensified in recent weeks, and the number of civilian casualties is growing by the day. Since the conflict began, more than 5,000 people have died, and nearly a million people have been driven from their homes and lost their livelihoods. The village of Debaltseve in eastern Ukraine is one of the communities caught in the violence, as our correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports. The wounded have been pouring in here from the front line, Ukrainian troops from the fighting in Debaltseve, a key town pro-Russian rebels have been battling to surround. Alexander was hit by shrapnel. A conscript, he tells me there have been fierce clashes for days now. If they give us the kit, we’ll keep shooting. We can win, he says. But their vehicles have broken down. They need spare parts, and he warns that they won’t hold out long like this. And here’s what the Ukrainian military are facing. This video, complete with soundtrack, was posted online by the separatists. They say they’re emptying all this on Ukrainian positions. The rebels talk of a new offensive. Moscow denies it, but Nato says they’ve received reinforcements and new weapons from Russia. Caught in the middle are the civilians. It took doctors four hours to remove all the shrapnel from Irina after a shell landed metres from her home. She’d just come back to the east because there was meant to be a cease-fire here. Her dad tells me it’s a miracle she survived. Aleksei wants the two sides in this conflict to talk and end all this. War won’t solve anything, he says. The renewed fighting has already created a new wave of refugees. Whilst these are safe and getting help, many people are still trapped in Debaltseve, like Marina’s mother, sheltering, terrified in her basement. TRANSLATION: My mother says she can’t bear it any more. There’s been shelling all the time. Children killed. She said she wants to hang herself or take pills. It’s impossible. It’s very scary. Her nerves can’t take it. Her town has become a key battleground, as Ukraine’s war rages once again. Government troops insist they will hold the line. But the cost to soldiers and civilians is mounting. Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, in eastern Ukraine. There was another sign of rising tensions today, when the Russian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office in London following an incident yesterday when Russian bombers flew over the English Channel and disrupted civilian aircraft. Our diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall is here. Tell us about that incident? This is not the first time that Russian long-range bombers have been noticed apparently testing the edges of Nato’s edifice is. They did not enter UK airspace, but tonight, the Foreign Office are calling this a significant escalation. Two Russian long-range bombers were noticed flying down the west coast of Ireland and then around the British Isles and into the beginning of the English Channel. They did not give notification of who they were, so tornado jets were scrambled to intercept them and check up on them. All of this was happening much further south than they have been before, a very busy corridor. That was why it disrupted civilian aircraft and why the Foreign Office is taking it seriously. And put that in the context of Russia’s tense relationship with the West now? Well, it is another incident of tension is rising. This is notjust about what is happening in Ukraine, it is in other arenas as well. Whenever I hear from western policymakers now, it is striking just how worried they are about this conflict with Russia and how it seems to be building. They are suspicious that Russia is fuelling the conflict in eastern Ukraine. That is why they are talking about tightening sanctions as much. But listen to the rhetoric from President Putin in Moscow, and he is also broadening it. He says it is notjust also broadening it. He says it is not just about notjust about Ukraine, he says it is a long-standing Western campaign, led by the United States, to weaken Russia and possibly oust him as president, and Russia needs to defend itself. So with the heightened suspicion on both sides, and you get incidents like this with planes, the possible it is for misunderstandings or miss calculation is really worrying. There was already an issue last year. That is why this is being taken so seriously. Thanks very much. Fewer than a hundred new cases of the Ebola virus were confirmed in West Africa last week, according to the World Health Organisation. French scientists who are tracking the outbreak say the virus could be mutating, and might be more contagious in future. They say they’re still working on developing an effective vaccine against Ebola. The UK’s big energy suppliers expect to make more money per customer in the coming 12 months than in 2014, according to the energy regulator Ofgem. That’s despite the fall in the price of oil and reductions in gas tariffs. There’s been criticism that firms aren’t passing on reductions in wholesale energy costs, but the group representing the utility companies has criticised the regulator’s figures. Heavy snow has been falling across northern parts of the UK, causing widespread disruption to roads, rail and air travel. Manchester Airport had to stop flights for several hours while snow ploughs cleared both runways. Hundreds of schools have been closed during the day. More snow is expected tonight across central and southern England. Swiping a card to get into work, to pay a bus fare or to buy a coffee could be redundant in years to come, if a new technique devised in Sweden catches on. At Epicenter, a new hi-tech office block, they are trialling a different approach. Those who want to gain entry need a chip implanted in their hand. The chip grants access to doors and the use of photocopiers, with more services promised. Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-jones couldn’t wait to try it out. Stockholm, and a nondescript building has been converted into a high-tech office space. But look under the skin to find something futuristic. Felicio de Costa doesn’t need a pass to get in. And then another swipe of the hand for access to his office. What is going on? I have a chip implant. That is why the doors let me in. Where is it? It is inside here. It can contain contact details. I think it can do a lot of other stuff in the future. The new offices will soon host a shifting population of 700 entrepreneurs and employees, and they will all be offered the chance to get chipped if they wish. As well as opening doors, it will allow them to use the photocopiers and in future log on to computers or pay for food in the cafe. I think it is only fair that in the interests of research, I am chipped. I’m told it will not hurt, but I have a few reservations about it. Let’s go. We’re done. The technology is still having teething problems. I found it a struggle to activate the photocopier. And among the people working here, I found some enthusiasm, but also caution. At the moment, I will not be chipped... because I do not feel it is necessary for opening doors, or connecting with machines. Can I get your contacts? The man behind the scheme, whose business card can be accessed via his chip, says the aim is to learn lessons. We want to be able to understand this technology... before big corporates and governments come to us and say, hey, everyone should get chipped, the tax authority chip, or the Google chip or Facebook chip. Another feature of this unconventional office, dogs are welcome. I’ve been chipped, have you? But while we’re used to having our pets chipped, putting technology under our own skin may be a step too far. Rory Cellan-jones, BBC News, Stockholm. In Melbourne, Andy Murray has reached the final of the Australian Open for the fourth time. He beat the Czech player Tomas Berdych in a rather fraught and bad-tempered match, and will now face either Novak Djokovic or Stan Wawrinka in Sunday’s final, as our correspondent joe Wilson reports. Tennis is a simple sport. just listen to the umpire. UMPIRE SPEAKS VERY QUICKLY. That’s clear, then. Well, actions speak louder than words. We had plenty of both here - Tomas Berdych belligerent, Andy Murray retrieving the unreachable. Oh, he’s got it! The intensity smouldered, meaningful looks exchanged, some Czech chat too. The first set took an hour and 16 minutes. Tie-break, Murray’s mistake. First set goes to Tomas Berdych. Murray took out his frustration on his opponent. He was rampant in the second set and won it 6-0. All in black, he was the ball’s shadow, pouncing to take the third set 6-3. And now Berdych was a man on the brink. The fourth set was tight, but Murray didn’t crumble, and took it 7-5. And who was Murray pointing out to give credit for his superb tennis? Well, how about his coach, Amelie Mauresmo? A lot of people criticised me working with her, and I think so far this week, we have showed that women can be very good coaches as well. Well, Murray’s fiancee, Kim Sears, lived every second. Lip-read in innocence here. She was far earthier earlier. Check the F for effort, as she seemed to say. Such tension is part of top-level tennis. Murray is showing his mean side, just when it matters. joe Wilson, BBC News. Some experts consider it the British equivalent of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel- it’s the magnificent ceiling of the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, on the banks of the River Thames. A major conservation project is restoring the hall to its former glory. It’s the first scheme of its kind since the middle of the last century, as our arts editor Will Gompertz explains. The Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, designed by Sir Christopher Wren around 1698. It’s an architectural masterpiece from the outside, and an artistic one inside. This is the Painted Hall, decorated byjames Thornhill with a brief to show off Britain’s superiority. King William and Queen Mary stare down triumphantly from above, with Louis XIV of France trampled beneath their feet. He is down at heel, rather like the ceiling itself. The Painted Hall started life as a dining room for Navy veterans, who, the story goes, weren’t beyond having the occasional food fight, some of the remnants of which are supposed to have stained the ceiling. I can’t see any evidence of that, but I can see it could do with some restoration. A multi-million-pound renovation is planned, but first, an evaluation must be made of the artwork’s current condition. We have a problem with surface accumulation of dust and grime, as one might imagine, but also a lot of surface deterioration of previous coatings applied in the 1950s. And here are those 1950s conservators at work, using techniques that would not wash today. They were talented, but the techniques they used were rather insensitive, 15 layers of varnish removed using a solvent and a new varnish layer applied. Today, the approach is different, it is understanding what is going on and making sure any intervention now does not affect the paintings in a negative way in the future. The Painted Hall is often hired out as a film location as a way of raising money, which as a free to visit tourist attraction, is much needed. Everyone has to do their bit, even Sirjames Thornhill, the revered painter of the Hall. Will Gompertz, BBC News, Greenwich. That’s all from us. Newsnight’s about to start on BBC Two. They’ll be marking the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill’s funeral by speaking to the last surviving member of his government. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Tonight on BBC London: The Metropolitan Police warns it needs tens of millions of pounds more to protect London from terrorism. We think it’s important that counterterrorism policing gets its fair share of that money. Claims that the City’s a hotbed for criminal moneylaundering from the man in charge of fighting organised crime. Treating the sick and elderly at home. We look at one solution to the shortage of hospital beds in the capital. And after a cold night, what’s in store tomorrow? We’ll have the weather forecast too. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner says he needs tens of millions of pounds of extra funding to protect London from the threat of terrorism. Speaking at City Hall in the wake of the attacks in Paris earlier this month, Sir Bernard Hogan Howe said the increasing use of online networks was taking up more resources than ever. Nick Beake reports. Protecting London from terrorism has often been highly visible. But now more and more time and money is being spent fighting those plotting attacks radicalising others online. Today, with a different and increasing threat, the commissioner said his counterterrorism teams need much more funding to keep us safe. We are talking about a significant number of resources. We do not reveal that figure publicly but it is in the tens of millions that we think we need. The Paris attacks were bloody reminders of the threat European capitals face. Across the UK, terrorist arrests went up by a third last year. The Met leads the fight but the Deputy Mayor for policing says it is a scandal that London’s police force is not getting sufficient extra funding. They do this surveillance work, and it is important that counterterrorism policing gets a share of additional money. 20 million is a good number. The national counterterrorism budget this year is £564 million. The Prime Minister has promised an extra 130 million. A larger amount is thought to be going to the Security Service. The Deputy Mayor claims police will only get £9.4 million of that part. One of the reasons London faces an increased terror threat these days is from returning fighters from the Middle East. Today the Mayor said he was encouraged that more parents in the ",,

That, he said, gave his officers an increased chance of stopping them going out to Syria and the first place. But it is a constant battle. The Home Office told us that the extra counterterrorism funding had not been finalised but insisted it will ensure the police and other agencies have the resources needed to respond to changing threats. There’s a warning tonight that billions of pounds of criminal money is being laundered through the City of London every day. The Head of the National Crime Agency, Keith Bristow, has been speaking in Washington this evening, where he says London’s reputation as a major global financial centre is at risk. Our reporter Louisa Preston has been following what’s been said. She’s in the City of London now. Yes, the head of the National Crime Agency was speaking in Washington tonight, and he was warning that Britain’s financial sector is in jeopardy because London is becoming the centre for the criminal financial activity of the world. He actually went on to say that some of the money going through Britain’s bank is linked to terrorist organisations and that money is being redirected back into terrorist activity. This is what he had to say. We are almost certain that hundreds of billions of dollars and pounds from criminal enterprises, this is people who have benefited from other people’s misery, laundered through the UK banking and financial services system, and that is partly because of the high transaction volumes we see in our system, the political stability which makes it very attractive for criminals to launder their money this way. But there have been questions about this before, haven’t they? Certainly, yes. HSBC, Britain’s biggest bank, was fined a record £1.1 billion when money was laundered through its branches. That was a massive blow. Many experts from banks, regulators and the Government come together in a forum to share their information to try to tackle crime but now it looks like more needs to be done as there billions going through the legal money everyday. Thank you. This week we’ve been looking at the pressures facing London’s health workers in our series front line NHS. Today, in the last of his reports, Karl Mercer looks at efforts to free up hospital beds by providing better after-care in the community, and at ways to help people out of hospital more quickly. I have been playing golf... These are my golfing pals. Alfred is 102 years young. He hopes to get back out into the golf course when the weather is better. How are you? Iam fine. He was already 36 when the NHS was born. These days he is at the forefront of how it is trying to change. It was in October? October, I was playing golf still. Alfred is no stranger to a hospital visit or two but the service in Croydon is trying to make him stay independent. Health visitor Veronica is part of that team trying to give them the services he needs. Without this help, I couldn’t manage. They make me independent. It is the secret of me being here. If you build up a rapport with them, it is easy. Alfred will say anything to me. If he needs anything, he will tell me and we try to resolve it. Yes, yes. Some older people are still very independent. If services like this are aimed at stopping people going to hospital, others are aimed at trying to get people out quicker. This man is at Croydon University Hospital after a number of falls. I got home and I said that I will look after myself but I fall down too many times. So they sent me back again. What am I to do? I think I can look after myself. You’re going to have some equipment in the bathroom to help you wash. Yes. Rachel helps to get patients home. Each inpatient ward has a social worker attached to it. A lot of pressure is on us. It is difficult to keep the department going and keep patients safe. We do not want every person bouncing back into hospital after A8 hours because we could have done something extra to stop it happening. This is our new whiteboard system... This is the latest weapon. It has up-to-the-minute information on patients. It is another tool being tested at a time when the NHS is facing testing times. Karl, we’ve seen the journey of patients this week from going to see the GP to leaving hospital, but plenty of common themes. Yes, and what we’re trying to do, we haven’t talked to politicians or policymakers, what we have done is talking -- policymakers, what we have done is talking -- talked to front line staff, whether it is the GP, the pharmacy, 111, seeing a 75% increase in its calls, the Ambulance Service, seeing its busiest winter ever, or the emergency departments struggling to see patients and get them out quickly enough. Common themes all round. They are all busy, or working very hard, and much of the issue is recruiting and retaining staff in London. It is a big issue for the NHS and public sector in general. People come here, they train in London but when they grow up, they want to have a family and get themselves a house, they find they can’t. Something that is a big worry for the head of the NHS, who spoke to us earlier. We do enjoy lots of people wanting to train in London. You know, doctors, physiotherapists. They come to London and trend here. When they qualify they spend a bit of time here but if they want to settle down it is quite expensive to do that in central London. This is general election year and it sees -- it seems the NHS is at the heart of the general election? Yes. They have seen the NHS rise to the top of the agenda in how they will vote. We might see that change because some are saying, it is the economy, stupid. But health will be one of the key issues when it comes to the election, make no mistake. And you can see all of Karl’s reports on the NHS in London on the BBC London website. Thousands of commuters have suffered yet more delays tonight - on one of London’s busiest routes. It’s now a week since flooding in a tunnel brought chaos to the Thameslink line - and today there were claims that something as simple as a blocked drain could be to blame. Here’s Tarah Welsh. Who is to blame for this? Network Rail says Thames Water should pay millions in compensation because a burst water main cause the tracks to flood on Friday. The water company admits that but says a lack of maintenance to the drainage system calls the prolonged flooding. It even released this picture to prove it. Isn’t it right, though, the initial problem was caused by Thames water so you need to take some responsibility? Absolutely no doubt about that and we have been clear with Network Rail that we fully accept the damage done, we have some responsibility for that. It has gone on for some days with the water not finding anywhere to drain away. The problem has led to heavy congestion in other stations, like St Pancras tonight. It isjust the knock-on effect and whoever the powers that be don’t seem to think about that. It has been fairly frustrating in respect of the length ofjourney I have and not really knowing from one minute to the next how long I will be having to wait. Network Rail has apologised to commuters and has said it will thoroughly discussed Thames Water’s points during an investigation. After seven days of problems and a war of words over who is to blame, we are told services will finally be up and running tomorrow morning. That is it from me. So to tell us more about the cold night ahead, here is the weather. Yes, andl Yes, and I have some showers to throw into that chilly mix as well! We did quite well for a while but then all of that came down from the Midlands and you may have been caught by some of those wintry showers that came down. That is not quite the end to the Winters tale but I now have my eye on something else and it may well be that, come the end of the night, there will be some wintry mess about the showers. So you could be waking up to a bit of a covering of snow. -- So you could be waking up to a bit of a covering of snow. -- some wintry feel about the showers. If you think, that would be a half decent day, you would be right. This will be the mildest day you were going to see right through the course of the weekend. It gets colder as the wind goes up towards the North. Good evening. As we saw on the news, the snow has been causing a few problems up and down the land, but, as usual, some still manage to enjoy it. There has been a bit more snow in Dumfries this evening and there will be a few more snow flurries tonight. But even if you don’t get snow, and many places won’t, there is the risk of some places being a bit tomorrow morning. Now we have this swell of cloud heading south, increasing the snow and sleet with rain mixed in over Northern Ireland and Wales, pushing into Southern counties, too, accompanied by a gusty wind. We could see a covering of snow as that wet weather pushes south towards the course of the night. Even if you don’t get the snow, and many eastern areas went, there is the risk of things being slippery as temperatures fall down below freezing. Any wet weather in the south-east soon moves away and for most of England and Wales, it is a dry start. Still a cold wind blowing, though. Particularly across south-west England. More sunshine on offer across parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland but Northern Scotland continues to she showers. -- to see showers. Some snow will continue over the hills. Tomorrow, much less in the way of snow, though. Some worries over the hills of Northern Ireland and northern England but for most places it brightens up quite nicely. Some sunshine with temperatures a bit higher. But don’t forget, with that wind it will still feel cold. And that isn’t going anywhere. Still with us through the weekend, coming down from the North. Northern Scotland seeing more snow on Saturday. Showers elsewhere with a mix of rain, sleet and snow. A lot of cloud on Saturday and feeling cold. But probably colder still on Sunday. This is the chart. The Arctic is where our air is coming from.

The cold wind stays with us through the weekend. Maybe Millions of us watch clips of animals showing what looks like friendship, affection and even love towards each other. But what really lies at the heart of these behaviours? Examining the truth behind nature’s special bonds. Tonight, we’re in Wrexham. Welcome to Question Time. Whether you’re watching or listening, welcome to you at home and to our audience here. On our panel tonight, Conservative Culture Secretary, Sajid javid. Former Labour Cabinet minister, Peter Hain. Plaid Cymru’s Economy Spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth. The Daily Telegraph blogger, Kate Maltby. And the feminist, author and critic, Germaine Greer. You canjoin the debate by text or Twitter. Our hashtag is BBCQT, follow us at BBC Question Time. Text comments to 83981, and use the Red Button to see what others are saying. Our first question. Is the NHS worse in Wales than in England? This was the contention of the Prime Minister in an angry exchange in the House of Commons this week, blaming labour for the condition of the NHS in Wales and saying therefore they could not be trusted with the NHS in the. Sajidjavid. Iam could not be trusted with the NHS in the. Sajid javid. I am the proud of our NHS and I wanted to be brilliant for everyone in Britain. But if you look at the performance that sticks for Wales versus the rest of the UK, it is worse in almost every category. -- it is worse in almost every category. -- the performance statistics. That is very sad. The challengers are the same throughout the UK, and we have to deal with them. People are living longer, which is a great thing but puts more pressure on health care. There are great new treatments and they cost more money. And the way we can deal with them is to firstly make sure the resources are available, that we spend enough on the NHS, as has been happening in England and Scotland. And also, we make sure that we can get it as efficient as possible. So why was Wales singled out? Because precisely Wales has not done that. Wales has cut spending on the NHS, increased bureaucracy, not invested in doctors and nurses, and the results are self evident. So I think this is clearly a big issue for people because we all care about the NHS, whether there is an election or not. And if people outside of Wales want to know what would happen to an NHS if Labour ran it, they only need to look here. APPLAUSE Peter Hain. Look, there are problems in the NHS in Wales, like there are crises in the NHS in England and I will come to that in a minute. What I object to is the Prime Minister, and now his culture minister repeating this mantra, singling out Wales for a naked party political reason. Not on the facts, but actually what I regard as a despicable attack on the NHS in Wales. APPLAUSE And actually, if you look at the key statistic, what do people in Wales think of their own NHS, nine out of ten are happy with it. What is the figure in England? just six out of ten, down from what it was under Labour, seven out of ten. That is not to say there are not problems. When you have had nearly 2 billion of the Welsh government’s budget cut by the Tory Lib Dems in Westminster, of course there are going to be problems. What else have we got? We have an older population, a population mostly concentrated in the south, the industrial South Wales, where there are high levels of deprivation and industrial injury, which means more pressure on the health service. And yet we have a much better record on discharging patients, they get better care. Because what has happened in England is 150,000 elderly patients who used to get care from local authorities now no longer do, because of the cuts in local government and local care. In Wales, we don’t have that at all. We have problems because of the cuts and sundry because all health services have problems. But I think this idea is about a war on Wales, and the phrase the Prime Minister used, a matter of life and death, what is he saying to the English Rugby union when it comes to play Wales next Friday, that they might die when they crossed the border because of the health service? This is absurd and really unpleasant. APPLAUSE Can I pick you up on one thing? What was the statistic you gave of satisfaction with the Welsh NHS, people were more satisfied? The last independent survey showed nine out of ten content with the NHS in Wales. I have a figure from the social attitudes survey, the 29th of january, saying 65% of the public in England are satisfied, 51% in Wales. That is not the study I have seen. I don’t want to quibble. On the spending point, he made a false point on spending as well. Wales gets spending which is 15% higher per head than England. Also, whenever spending on NHS England is increased, Wales gets its proportional share. The problem is the Welsh government uses it elsewhere, wastes it and does not use it on the Welsh NHS. You have allowed social care to collapse. Why, if it is true what you say, as spending on health, as a percentage of the overall Welsh budget, increased since 2010? There are the figures, you can read them. APPLAUSE I will explain that precisely. Because overall spending, just like the rest of the UK, Wales has had to cut back, but in England we protected spending on the NHS. The Welsh government did not. Instead of prioritising the NHS, it put money elsewhere. It got its fair share of the increase. When England increases it, Wales and Scotland get a share. Wales did not prioritise the NHS. We invested in social care and you did not, which is why you have crisis all over England. Here we are, we have the health board in North Wales and they have lost £78 million this year. They have to take it off local councils to pay it back. But the point I am going to make is that they have been closing cottage hospitals, one with about 15 beds. We see on national news, not Welsh news, queues of ambulances outside the hospital here. Why? Because of bed blocking. If they left cottage hospitals open, people in those beds could have gone to cottage hospitals and we would not see those queues. ",,

Hundreds ofjobs under threat in Hertfordshire. Tesco plans to close its headquarters. Across the capital, people join the minute silence remembering those killed in France. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. A massive manhunt is under way in France where police are searching for two brothers who are believed to have murdered 12 people in Paris yesterday. There are reports that they have been seen this morning at this service station 50 miles north of Paris. They were said to be masked and heavily armed. It is said that Maxtor food and petrol. Police are warning they may be heading back to Paris. Another police officer has been killed today south of Paris. It’s not known if her death was linked to yesterday’s attack at the French magazine Charlie Hebdo. This morning people in France stopped for a minute’s silence to remember those who died. Christian Fraser is in Paris for us now. It’s been a sombre day here in Paris, cloudy and rainy, but it hasn’t stopped people here paving their respects to the 12 people who died in yesterday’s attack. President Francois Hollande led the tributes, calling on the French to unite against terrorism and intolerance. The funeral bell tolling as a nation paused to mourn. Tenjournalists, two policemen murdered in cold blood, and the gunmen are still at large. Francois Hollande, who stood with policemen, said Unity is the ants, but French society is afraid, and angry. How long can it be before recriminations begin? TRANSLATION: We are angry. On my building, we put UP We are angry. On my building, we put upa big We are angry. On my building, we put up a big warning. Everyone is doing it. je suis Charlie. I am going to march on Saturday to show my defiance. Outside Paris, roadworks were in place at all major intersections. There were several arrests overnight. Most of the activity was focused north of the capital. These are the key men. Named as brothers, they are French nationals of Algerian descent in their early 30s. Cherif Kouachi was known to French intelligence and was jailed in 2008 for recruiting sympathies to the to had asked cause in Iraq. -- sympathies to the to had asked cause in Iraq. -- jihadist cause. Two police officers were shot in a suburb, one of them later died. The man who fled to the Metro was carrying a machine gun and dressed in body armour. The heavily armed anti-terror police are looking for the person responsible. The longer the suspects are on the run the greater the risk of copycat attacks. France has suffered five terror attacks in a month and two in 24 hours. Senior mirrors -- attacks in a month and two in 24 hours. Senior mirrors -- ministers rushed to a meeting. There have been calls for calm and responsible reporting. TRANSLATION: Iask calls for calm and responsible reporting. TRANSLATION: I ask that the press outlets be particularly prudent about the type of information that is broadcast today on your airways because all information can also affect the investigative work. Politicians are mindful of the threat and to underline the divisions there is news of an explosion near a mosque in Lyon. No link has been suggested but it has been identified as a criminal act. A day of national mourning has already been overshadowed by more death and mayhem. One of the biggest manhunts in France’s history is under way. It is pandemonium on the streets of Paris with police cars going this way and that, armed police on every corner, road blocks in place and reports that they are blocking access points back into Paris. I told you that we have heard that the two men have been spotted on a road heading north out of Paris. We canjoin our Europe correspondent on that road. What can you tell us? Yes. This is the site about an hour from where you are north-east of Paris. This petrol station, where the suspects, it is believed, were slated this morning by the manager-- spotted this morning. The two men came here and held up the police station and took food and fuel and drove off in that direction heading towards Paris. What we have is police officers who were at the scene... We have seen them inside the petrol station apparently looking at the video monitors, the CCTV footage, and we have also seen at the road junctions going down from here armed police units and at least the map helicopters two military helicopters and one police helicopter circling the weights in the area. -- and one police helicopter circling the weights in the area. -- woods. We have had another report saying that might have been another sighting possibly in this area. A huge police operation going on. Seven suspects have been rounded up in the past 24 hours who were known to these two brothers and properties have been raided in the north of Paris. It is becoming clear that they were known, at least one of them, to the intelligence services, but how recently they were under surveillance is not known. Masked and armed, the two Paris gunmen have now been named as two brothers. Cherif Kouachi and Saeed Kouachi. Cherif Kouachi was well- known to the police. He was convicted in 2008 of helping jihadists travel to Iraq. A third man, aged 18, gave himself up at this police station, but it is thought unlikely he was involved in the attack. The French government is having to defend itself that the murders were able to take place. TRANSLATION: It is the number of individuals who present a danger. These individuals were probably being followed but there is always a degree of risk. That is hard to hear because there are victims. Yesterday’s terrorist attack was the worst on French soil in living memory. There is every indication the gunmen have been trained by otherjihadists, possibly in Syria. It took place in the heart of Paris in broad daylight aiming for maximum publicity. It began at 11:30am at the office of Charlie Hebdo where ten people were shot dead. The gunman fled after killing two policemen, jumped into a getaway car which was later found abandoned, but inside were vital forensic clues and the identity card of one of the brothers. All this against a backdrop of hundreds of French jihadis going to Syria. France has the highest contingent of any European country. That and the French shootings are prompting widespread debates about the limits of free speech. No philosophy, including my own religion Islam, can ever be held to be above scrutiny. Satirising any idea, including religion, is a sacred rate because freedom of speech allows democracy to take. This crisis is far from over. Even if and when the gunmen are caught or killed, French police and people of other European countries will continue to face the threat of isolated attack from people who are armed, trained and fanatical. Events fanatical. Eve nts changing our tower. fanatical. Events changing our tower. There are two terror investigations going on. There is political unity. The former president was here on this state this morning to meet Francois Hollande -- the steps. We are hearing from the staff at Charlie Hebdo that they are going to publish the magazine that the staff had put together, at the end of this week. One of the police officers shot dead on the pavement yesterday has been named as Ahmed Mourabet, a Muslim, who’s believed to be of Moroccan origin. Tributes to the victims of the attack have continued to pour in. Across the world, vigils have been held to remember the dead and to support freedom of speech. jon Brain reports. They were paid to make people laugh. They paid the ultimate price. The staff of Charlie Hebdo magazine were well aware of the risks. In November 2011 their offices had been firebombed for publishing a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed. The editor remains defiant. Later he gave an interview which now seems prophetic. Without freedom of speech we are dead. We cannot live in a country without freedom of speech. I prefer to die than live like a rat. Around the world fellow cartoonist have been responding with their only weapon, satire, drawing a defence of the freedom of speech and the right to offend. Outside the French Embassy in Buenos Aires, one cartoonist spoke for many. TRANSLATION: In an attack on freedom of speech you must express yourself even more. It can be language or a pencil. The support for the victims of the attack is global. This is the job was one of many. People took to the streets in New York as well as several European cities. It is in Paris where emotions are most raw. A makeshift shrine marks the scene of the tragedy. TRANSLATION: I came here to show solidarity with the newspaper, thejournalists here to show solidarity with the newspaper, the journalists and the policeman. The whole of France has been hurt by what happened yesterday. This is a nation in pain. Here, security is being tightened up at various ports around the UK, but Downing Street say they do not believe there is any direct threat to the UK as a result of the attacks in France. Our home affairs correspondent looks at the response from the British government. At exactly 10:30am, approximately the moment of the attack yesterday, police officers across Britain paused for two minutes, an act of remembrance for the 12 people who died yesterday, among them two police officers, and the moment to reflect on the threat in Britain. I do not think anybody needs reminding of the threat we face. We are well aware and the Metropolitan Police has capabilities to Cork. Today is about remembering the people of France and our colleagues who are engaged in operations. British police have been painfully aware of the threat since the Mumbai attack of 2008. Yesterday’s attack has been a reminder of how real that threat is. A group of men with machine guns cost have up in railway stations during a stand-off at a luxury hotel which led to British police deploying more armed officers in vehicles and train them better for it tackling gunmen. Armed police in all regions of the UK have more powerful weapons, which should overcome that defence. In case of a sustained armed siege like Mumbai, they can call on military support. That was why the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was that the emergency Cobra committee meeting in Whitehall this morning, chaired by the Home Secretary. Officers from borderforce, the police and other organisations operating at the UK border have intensified checks on passengers, on vehicles and goods, coming from France and other parts of Europe. This is not in response to specific intelligence or a plot against the United Kingdom. Bottas journalists, like these that the Guardian newspaper, also held moments of silence, everyone is aware that no security measures can deal with the first few minutes of an armed attack. The huge manhunt in France continues this lunch time. We will be going back there later in the programme for the very latest. Our top story this lunchtime. The two main suspects in the Paris shootings are reported to have been sighted at a service station. it’s not known if there’s a link. Later on BBC London: Plans to give Greenwich Power Station a new lease of life - fuelling the capital’s Tube network. And Team Wiggins - Sir Bradley is to launch a new professional cycling team, as he prepares for the 2016 Olympics. Two of Britain’s biggest high street names have become the latest to report a fall in sales over the Christmas period. The country’s biggest retailer, Tesco, said its sales were down by nearly 3%. It’s now closing 43 unprofitable stores to cut costs. And Marks and Spencer says it saw a drop in sales of nearly 6%. It’s all yet more evidence of the pressure on the UK’s retailers, as our business correspondent, Emma Simpson, now reports. They are two of our biggest retailers, with very different Christmas stories. Tesco’s cheap veg was a winner, serving up a Christmas that was much better than expected. Only half a year ago they were losing 5% of customers and volumes, year on year. At Christmas, they stayed flat. Going from losing 5% to standing flat is a substantial improvement. Tesco’s fightback is under way, improvement. Tesco’s fightback is underway, kicking under way, kicking off today with hundreds of price cuts. It is cutting costs to help pay for them, including closing its head office and its pension scheme. This big restructuring will also bring job losses and the shutting of 43 stores which are no longer making any money. Welcome to and, a Tesco town. You don’t have to travel far see there is an awful lot of them here -- and over. Tesco has more supermarkets than anyone else and it will be the first grocer to shut ones. A further 49 elements will never be built. The problem is we are not shopping like we used to. We don’t do any big shots, just stuff we need. Smaller shops, more often, I’d say. I don’t do a big shop and I notice a lot of people don’t any more. The boss wants to build a better, simplerTesco. more. The boss wants to build a better, simpler Tesco. The city likes what it heard, but turning things around will take time. There are some very significant unresolved issues that Tesco must address, particularly its balance sheet and non-UK operations. I believe there will be more significant news and it will be positive. Tesco’s share price posted its biggest one-day gain in severalyears, price posted its biggest one-day gain in several years, but over at Marks & Spencer, shares were sharply down. There was plenty of magic in the Christmas ad, but sales of clothing and home wares didn’t sparkle. Down by nearly 6%, a much bigger fall than expected. So were online sales. The collections may have looked good, but Marx had big logistical problems getting Internet orders delivered. As it entered 2015, reviving the all-important women’s fashion is still a work in progress. Oldham Athletic will not now sign the convicted rapist, Ched Evans. A board member at the football club has told the BBC that they’ve made the decision after ""enormous pressure from sponsors and threats to staff and their families"". Let’s speak to our sports correspondent, Tell us about what they are saying. There are serious threats made? There is an astonishing chain of events. On Sunday we heard Oldham Athletic were in line to sign the 26-year-old striker. It led to four days of speculation and debate. Yesterday, we heard from the owner, who said he had served his time and they were 80% sure they would sign him. A petition has attracted more than 60,000 signatures. Politicians weighed in on the bait. Ake reaction -- a key reaction was the reaction of sponsors. One severed all ties. Two said we will sever our ties. League One level money is a huge factor. We have heard that board members have said they have been getting threats. One told the BBC that a female relative had a threat of being raped if the club signed him. We understand Ched Evans will release a statement later this afternoon, saying he understands the club’s change of heart. It is the second time a club has had to abandon attempts to sign him. Sheffield United had to pull out of allowing him to train. It looks likely that any club will not run that gauntlet of hate. The US Air Force base at Mildenhall in Suffolk is to close, with operations being moved to other locations - including Germany. It’s currently home to US Air Force special forces and a fleet of air-to-air tankers with more than 3000 military personnel based there. Two smaller American bases in East Anglia, at Alconbury and Molesworth, will also shut. The American comedian, Bill Cosby, has made his first stage appearance since more than a dozen women began making allegations that he’d sexually assaulted them in the 1980s and ‘90s. A number of protestors were outside the theatre in Canada and heckled people going in. But the show in Ontario went ahead, as our correspondent David Willis now reports. Braving Canada’s Arctic temperatures, Bill Cosby arrived here only to find feelings every bit as chilly as they are back home. Go home, Bill Cosby’s got to go. There were heated exchanges outside the theatre. Supporting rape in our community. And protesters heckled those attending the performance. How would you feel if it was one of your kids? He handed me a tall, thin, champagne type of glass. just a few hours earlier in Los Angeles three more women have come forward to claim they too were sexually assaulted by Bill Cosby. I said, what are you doing? Stop. In Kitchener, some were still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Until there’s an actual charge and conviction I’ll still support him. No qualms about going tonight? No, not at all. Despite fears to the contrary, the show off passed off peacefully thanks largely to a substantial security presence. This was to have been a victory lap for Bill Cosby, a tour that would mark his coronation as one of the greatest entertainers of all time. But with the protests growing and more than a dozen dates still on the calendar, completing it may prove the toughest task of his career. Bill Cosby was once arguably the most beloved man in America. Now, the muscle that surrounds him tells a different story. He’s gone from patriarch to pariah in the minds of many. Do you have anything to say? Yet continues to strenuously deny the allegations against him. The world’s largest cargo ship has arrived for the first time in the UK. It docked at Felixstowe - the only port big enough to accommodate it. The Globe is more than 400 metres long and has room for 19,000 containers filled with food, clothes and furniture. Our transport correspondent Richard West reports. It’sjust big - very, very big. Bigger than most of our buildings and somehow it floats. just look at that. It’s incredible, like a wall of steel in the middle of the sea. That is the world’s largest container ship about to dock in the UK for the first time. So much of what we have arrives this way. The clothes we are wearing, the food we’re eating, probably the television you’re watching this on now, all came by ship. A giant shopping basket, here to restock the shelves after Christmas. On her maiden voyage from China, this is the Globe’s first visit to Britain. On board, 19,100 containers, a world record, although not for long. If you think this one is big, ten years ago we had something like 9000, which is less than half of this vessel here, and going forward into the future I think 22-24,000 unit vessels are already on the drawing board. It might be the world’s largest container ship but you still steer it like a Mini Metro. It’s got all the other things you would expect, a compass, dead slow, stop, telling the engine room what to do, but it’s out here where the real action is going on. This is not a place you want to go if you suffer from any kind of fear of heights. just have a look down here. See how the containers are stacked up, all the way up the deck, with the bottom deck down there. It’s over here where the real action is going on. The whole point of this ship - shifting containers around the world. Ships this size will soon be a regular sight in our ports, running an endless loop between Asia and Europe. The next time you buy something it may well have arrived like this. We will be going back to Paris shortly for the latest on our main story, but let’s get a look at the weather. The storm on the way looks really mean. We are looking at storm force winds particularly in the northern half of the British Isles. It is worth staying in touch with the forecast. We have seen a band of rain pushed eastwards, slow to clear from East Anglia and the far south-east. The sunshine has come out in London. Most of us will see sunny spells in the afternoon. There will be snow showers pushing into Scotland, particularly over the hills. The temperatures go down, it will start to feel chilly across northern areas. Temperatures 5-6 Celsius. As we say goodbye to the weather system that has been affecting England and Wales today, we look out into the mid-Atlantic and the focus is on the next weather system which is showing signs of developing under an incredibly powerfuljet stream. It will be running at 260 miles. -- miles an hour. Flights from America may arrive early thanks to the strong winds. This is what it does to the area of low pressure, it deepens it. The isobars are packing in. We are looking at really strong winds picking up. Through the night a band of rain will push in, we start to get the winds picking up. Storm force winds. Winds gusting in excess of 100 miles an hour across the North West of Scotland and through the central belt, 80 miles an hour gusts. These are damaging and could cause transport disruption and knockout power supplies. There will be windy weather in Northern Ireland and the North of England. On Friday, more rain, snow on the northern edge as it moves into Scotland. Relatively mild in the south, where it stays dull, damp and windy. Through Friday night, another area of low pressure will bring stormy winds to the far north of Scotland. Potentially storm force winds, especially for the Northern Isles. A band of rain pushes southwards. The air turns colder band of rain pushes southwards. The airturns colderand air turns colder and there could be ice first thing in the morning and snow potentially getting down to lower levels in the far north-west of Scotland, where the winds will make it feel chilly. There is a lot of weather warnings across different parts of the country. Find out the latest on the BBC weather website. Let’s get more on our main story this lunch time, one of the biggest manhunts in France’s history is under way. The two main suspects in yesterday’s killings are reported to have been sighted at a service station 50 miles north of the capital. Let’s return to Christian Fraser in Paris. The police operation is focused north of the capital on the roads around Paris. It is right, we had a second emergency cabinet meeting in the leaves a palace and the authorities are racing against the clock trying to prevent another attack. They were spotted twice on this trunk Road North of Paris and there have been reports on French television that they did a U-turn and may come back to Paris. Suddenly, there were roadblocks all around the city, total pandemonium, the access points to Paris were closed down and there are roadblocks in place on the major intersections. A separate investigation now into another terror attack, a policewoman killed in a southern suburb of Paris this morning, a shooting near to the Metro and that gunman is still at large. In Lyon, an explosion in the barbershop near a mosque. We don’t think it is linked to what is going on here but it could be a tit-for-tat attack. It will worry ",,
170,BBC News 24,8-jan-2015,BBC News at Six,18:00,30 mins,True,"GUNSHOT Death In Paradise returns... Today at 6.00pm - a national day of mourning in France, as police hunt for the perpetrators of yesterday’s terrorist attacks which left 12 people dead. Across the country, at noon, people observed a minute’s silence as people responded to the president’s call for a strong show of unity and solidarity with the magazine Charlie Hebdo. ie je Suis Charlie. Wherever you are world, it is aic event. A massive police effort is still in progress, looking for the two suspected gunmen - Cherif Kouachi and his brother Said, French citizens of Algerian background. Police say they were spotted some Ao miles outside Paris. Armed officers are now searching in a forest northeast of the capital. Also on tonight’s programme: Tesco announces it’s to close dozens of unprofitable stores and cancels plans to open new ones. David Cameron says he won’t take part in any TV election debates without the Greens. Labourand UKIP accuse him of running scared. And Oldham Athletic say they won’t sign convicted rapist Ched Evans as he apologises for the effects of his actions. Tonight on BBC London: Met officers pay their respects to the 12 shot dead in Paris, as Londoners observe a minute’s silence. And armed police patrols are stepped up at the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras International. Good evening from Paris on a national day of mourning in France as police still hunt for the perpetrators of yesterday’s terrorist attack. We are in the heart of the capital this evening. 12 people were shot dead, including two police officers, when gunmen broke into the office of a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo. Police have released these images of the suspects - Cherif Kouachi and his brother Said Kouachi. They’re French citizens of Algerian descent. They’re armed, and it’s understood they were seen at a petrol station close to Villers-Cotterets, some Ao miles outside Paris taking on fuel and supplies. In a separate shooting this morning, a policewoman was killed in a southern suburb of Paris. First tonight, let’sjoin Damian Grammaticas who’s been following the manhunt outside Paris. We have just heard from the Interior Minister here that 88,000 police and military have been deployed in France today in this hunt and that hunt through the day has focussed on this area here. We are north-east of Paris, towards the area famous for growing champagne but what triggered the search this morning were those reports of a robbery, not very far from here, along the highway leading from Paris. Swooping low, police hunting the Paris attackers today. An hour’s drive outside the city, a petrol station but it seems they were just a couple of hours behind their suspects. As they looked through the security camera footage, there were fears the men were heading back towards Paris. The manager said the attackers, still carrying kalashnikovs, had stolen food and fuel this morning. So military helicopters, doors open, armed soldiers visible inside, flew low over the roads, looking for the grey Renault getaway car. The two suspects, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi are French-born, both in their 30s, known for their ties to radical groups. By early afternoon, anti-terror units were converging on one village, Longpont. Once in the village they moved in cautiously. The officers know the attackers have already killed two policemen - one executed in cold blood - And fear what they will do if they are cornered. Officers blocked all roads to the village. Well, this is as close as we can get. The road down to the village of Longpont, just down there, sealed off. The armed police we have seen in this area all day have converged on there and that’s where they are focussing their search. This local man said the police are going door-to-door he said checking every house. So, for a second night now, France remains on its highest alert. The killers still on the loose, but the net may be closing. Much of this city came to a halt today for a minute of silence to honour those who died in the worst terrorist atrocity in living memory. Flags were flown at half mast and even the city’s metro system stopped running. Tonight the Eiffel Tower will switch off its lights as a tribute. Our Europe Editor, Gavin Hewitt, sent this report on the day France mourned the victims of the attack. The deep bells of Notre Dam marked France’s day of mourning. At midday, hundreds of people stood in silence, with the only sound rain on umbrellas. Strained faces remembered the 12 people killed at the office of a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo yesterday. Many held high the journalists’ pencil in support of freedom of speech. They finished with applause for those who had died in a terrorist attack. I feel we need to protect freedom but people want to break that and we have to fight for freedom. want to break that and we have to fight forfreedom. je fight for freedom. je Suis Charlie. I am Charlie. Wherever you are in the world, this is a tragic event. I’m going to march on Saturday to show my defiance to murders and evil fundamentalists. The French President, Francois Hollande was at police headquarters. Two officers were killed in yesterday’s attack. Today Paris was tense. Early morning, police units went to to a southern suburb. A police woman and a colleague were shot by a man with a rifle. Once again, residents in the French capital had witnessed shooting on their streets. Trans-Troon I heard three shots. I wept down and saw a police woman lying on the floor. Someone was trying to resuscitate her. I saw a policeman who had been shot and went and called an ambulance. After the phone calls were made from here that two police officers had been shot, antiterrorist units rushed to the scene. The injured were taken away in ambulances under full police escort and an investigation began as to what the significance of this was. The police do yet know if this attack had any links with what happened yesterday - attack had any links with what happened yesterday - an antiterrorist investigation has been formally opened. The police woman later died of her injuries. In the face of these attacks, the French political establishment has tried to give a united response. Today the former French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was invited back to the Elysee Palace. TRANSLATION: Civilised people, whatever their conviction, should unite in the face of this fanatic barbarity. This is a declaration of war on civilisation and the responsibility of civilisation is to defend itself. Candles and flowers have been laid close to the offices of Charlie Hebdo. It will defy its attackers by next week publishing a special edition with a print run of1 million copies. The paper said it was the best way to pay homage to those who died. Muslim leaders in France have condemned the killings in the strongest terms. President Hollande said freedom of speech had come under attack but nothing would divide the nation and its ideals. The attack on Charlie Hebdo has also raised fears of a backlash against Muslims in France, which has the largest Muslim community in Western Europe. Our special correspondent Fergal Keane reports on the response among the Muslim community. Suburb is often loaded with negative association. In the minds of some French, these estates can be breeding grounds of radical film. Here in this northern suburb, Cherif Kouachi, one of the alleged attackers lived quietly before becoming one of the most wanted men in France. His neighbours remember him as kolite and kind. TRANSLATION: He was nice, correct and clean and very helpful disabled people. I saw him here every day. The last time was three days ago. There is shock here and among some Muslims I spoke with, a fear that attacks like this threatened their place in France. This woman was too afraid to show her face. TRANSLATION:. This woman was too afraid to show herface. TRANSLATION:. Because her face. TRANSLATION:. Because we have children, we are afraid of everything. Everybody is looking at us as if we did it. Everybody says - you are Arab, you are Muslim. While there have been isolated attacks on Muslim-owned properties, there is a national drive for unity. At the grand mosque of Paris today an unprecedented show of interfaith solidarity. Buddhists, jewish, Christian leaders joined Muslims solidarity. Buddhists, jewish, Christian leadersjoined Muslims in the silence for the dead. There will be people in this society who now fear Islam. What do you say to them? TRANSLATION: We are here to say that Islam has its own full place in the republic and we say this together n unanimity. France is outraged but not yet polarised between Muslims and the rest. That isn’t to underestimate the potential for a much wider crisis. Muslim elders say the key to tackling the problem is breaking the power of radical Islam among the alienated young. TRANSLATION: We need to be very careful with such young people. They are nurtured by fundamentalists who are members of terrorist groups. These people should learn the values of democracy and the republic in our schools. They should not commit these kind of crimes. The background from which the attackers emerged was impoverished and claustrophobic. They were radicalised both by personal circumstance and larger politics. The challenge for the French Government isn’t just a security one. It is to make those who feel alienated, who owe no allegiance to the French state, feel part of a French identity. It’s now become clear that at least one of the suspects was known to the French security services, after being jailed for sending fighters to Iraq in 2008. In Britain, security is being tightened at various ports but Downing Street says it does not believe there is any direct threat to the UK as a result of the attack. Our home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, looks at the suspects and the security response from the British Government. The two gunmen who slaughtered 12 people in Paris yesterday are believed to be Kouachi and his brother Said, French citizens of algearian descent. Their parents died when they were young and they grew up in a care home in Brit Annie in northern France. More recently, Cherif Kouachi, the younger of the two, worked as a pizza delivery driver in Paris. He was a known militant who was detained in 2005 while boarding a flight to Syria and jailed in 2008. His older brother, Said was a suspect in a prison escape plot four years a go. It is claimed both brothers attended a radical mosque. It left the French Prime Minister among those leading the mourning today, having to admit that the killers were on the radar of the Security Services. TRANSLATION: These individuals were no doubt followed but there is no such thick as zero risk. It is a terrible thing to say, because there are victims, and there has been a terrible attack and we are all shaken and thinking of the victims and those fighting for their lives. The Paris shooting began at 11.30am yesterday at the offices of the satirical magazine, Charlie he be co. There, the gunmen killed severaljournalists before shooting and killing two police officers. They fled in a car, which was found bane donned a couple of miles away. Cherif Kouachi, seen here in a video made several years ago, is now on the run with his brother, at the centre of one of the biggest manhunts France has ever seen. In Britain, extra patrol of armed officers were laid on at St Pancras station in London, the railway hub for France, and at ports. Officers from borderforce, the police and other organisations operating at the UK border have intensified checks on passengers, on vehicles and goods, coming from France, and other parts of Europe. Police in Britain have been acutely aware of the threat from what they call ""marauding gunmen"" since the Mumbai attacks of 2008, but the attack in Paris yesterday was a reminder of how real that threat is. Since Mumbai, police officers here have been issued with more powerful weapons and can call on the army for back-up. But as they held a two minute silence across Britain, officers were also thinking of their fallen colleagues in France. We will have more from Paris later, including an update on the massive police search going on some Ao or 50 miles north-east of Paris. In the meantime, back to London. A huge manhunt is under way for a 2 brothers suspected of the Paris attack. And still to come, as Oldham say they won’t sign Ched Evans, will the Later on BBC London: Reenergising the capital. Plans to revamp Greenwich power station to help run the Underground. 25 years after taking Palace to the Cup final, Alan Pardew faces up to a new challenge at Selhurst Park. Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, has announced it’s going to get a bit smaller as part of a major plan to restore profits and take on its rivals. The retail giant has been hit by falling sales and increased competition from discount chains like Aldi and Lidl. Sales for the last quarter fell by nearly 3%, despite good figures for the Christmas period. Tesco is now going to close over Ao unprofitable stores and says it’s cancelling plans to open A9 more. But it’ll still be running more than 3,700 stores in the UK. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, reports. The lights flickering back on at Tesco. After years of miserable news, customers are returning to Britain’s a guest retailer. Price cutting has given the supermarket a Christmas lift. We put more than 6000 more colleagues in hours door to be serving customers and we got very strong feedback from customers that they appreciated it. -- strong feedback from customers that they appreciated it. -- in our stores. We made more things available and we invested specifically in things they were looking for at Christmas. Selling a few extra carrots, parsnips and Christmas puddings may be all very well, but it will not be enough to turn around this business. Last autumn there was an accounting scandal. There have been endless profit warnings and falling sales for years. To truly recover, Tesco needs to do something radical. The big change is store closures, like here in handover, where there are 11 Tesco is within 13 miles. One has already closed and Tesco is looking at a further A3 closures around the country. People told us they were not shopping in the same way any more. Tesco has to catch up. Smaller shops more often. Ido not do a big shock. I notice a lot of people do not. We do not do big shops, no. just stuff we need. Tesco is going further and abandoning store openings, like this one in Cambridgeshire. It has been built but today it emerged it will never open. Plans for A8 other stories have been shelved. The stories we announced today we will be closing our stores that are unprofitable and not stores we can see a way of making profitable. With a huge and heavy heart, because of the impact it will have on colleagues and communities, I had to take the difficult decision. job losses are likely to follow. But Mr Lewis said front line staff would be protected. Tesco did say it would lower prices after similar announcements by ASDA and Sainsbury’s. One ward Dave Lewis said he does not want to see a repeat of is this, Black Friday. Price cutting, it seems, can only go so far in the turnaround Tesco. Marks and Spencer has also reported disappointing sales of its clothing in its latest figures - blaming the unseasonably mild autumn weather and online delivery problems. M&S said general merchandise sales - which are mainly clothing - fell by nearly 6% in the three months to September last year, compared with the year before. The Prime Minister has said he will not take part in any TV debates ahead of the general election, unless the Green Party are also included. The current proposals only include the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Ukip. Let’s talk to Nick Robinson at Westminster. Labour and Labourand Ukip eye Labour and Ukip eye rake using David Cameron of being chicken? There is a chance these debates will not take place because of what David Cameron said. 22 million of us watched some or all of the debates last time. David Cameron says the Green Party should take part as well as him, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and the new addition in this election, Nigel Farage. Why not simply do that, you ask? The broadcasters are worried they would get sued by the Scottish National Party. They would be able to say, we have got more members than the Greens, more MPs than the Greens, therefore we should take part as well. There is another political reason why this is going wrong. David Cameron was told by his advisers he should never have done this last time around. He gave a leg UP this last time around. He gave a leg up to Nick Clegg and it helped Gordon Brown, too. He has told his closest allies that if there are no debates during the election campaign itself, he would be rather happy. Oldham Athletic have pulled out of their attempt to offer the convicted rapist, Ched Evans, a return to professional football. The BBC has been told the decision not to sign him was taken after ""enormous pressure from sponsors and threats to staff and their families"". Ched Evans apologised this afternoon for the effects of his actions in 2011, but continues to maintain his innocence. He said in the last hour in the last hour and he feels mob rule contributed to Oldham Athletic’s decision. Here’s our Sports Editor, Dan Roan. Ched Evans leaving home this morning with his fiancee. A deal with Oldham Athletic collapsed after a storm of rancour and opposition. Proceeding could have placed financial pressure on the club. As a consequence, the deal could not go ahead. We deplore and condemn the violence and abusive threats, some including death threats, made two fans, and staff. 83 days after leaving prison, this afternoon game the first show of contrition from evidence towards the victim he was accused of raping. We have not approached any club suggesting they sign him. But what we have made clear is that any club wishing to sign him will have our full support. Despite his goals, he has now been turned down by a host of clubs after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011. The fact this protracted signing ended amid vicious threats made to staff here shows how divisive the issue of Ched Evans’s future has become, a saga which has done nothing for the reputation of this club, the sport or certain sections of society. Sponsors who threatened to withdraw their investment in the club are pleased. We are glad this is the decision that has been arrived at. It may have taken a few days but we would rather it had taken time to come to the right decision. And so one of the most controversial deals the game has ever seen is finally off. Evans is made to face a future in footballing wilderness. Time for a look at the weather- here’s Sarah Keith Lucas. Things will turn lively in the next few hours. Stormy conditions. Windiest in the north. Some disruption in the next couple of days. Warnings in force from the Met office. Yellow warnings across Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland. Amber warnings in place for the strength of the wind in northern Scotland and the central belt in the next 12 hours. We have got a rapidly deepening area of low pressure pushing in from the Atlantic. You can see the proximity of the isobars. A drop in around 20 millibars. A lull at the moment. Wet and windy weather heading in from the West this evening. It is really the winds that the main feature of the weather. 100 mph winds in the north of Scotland. We could see 70 to 80 mph through the central belt. It could cause disruption to travel. We could see some power outages. Friday starts off dry and breezy. The next rain pushing in from the west later on Friday. There could be some significant rain across parts of Cumbria, for instance. Mild in the South. The next batch of wet and windy weather lurking in the wings. Low pressure heading to the north of the UK on Friday to Saturday. For Saturday, another spell of heavy rain. Behind that, things turning colder. We could see some snow and ice in the North. A lot happening in the weather in the next few days. Keep tuned. More now on our top story, and the massive manhunt in France for the two men suspected of yesterdays attack in Paris which left 12 people dead. Huw is there for us. Fiona, thanks. The response from the French press and media has been notably consistent. Most agree that Islamist extremism needs to be reported in a more assertive way and defending the right of magazines like Charlie Hebdo to publish controversial cartoons on a range of subjects. Some have been creating their own hard-hitting cartoons in response. The range and quality of this body of work is the best possible tribute to the journalists of Charlie Hebdo. Adapting the familiar sometimes and creating a message of real strength and power. It’s a message of defiance. The cartoons are a statement in the face of violence and intolerance. And that’s certainly the spirit here at the editorial offices of Le Monde, the world-famous French newspaper. Sylvie Kauffmann is the editor of Le Monde and she explained the impact of yesterday’s attack on the French media and their determination not to be intimidated. We never thought that a newsroom could be attacked and massacred in this way. So there was shock and there was an immediate reaction of solidarity. We are now all publishing things jointly and we are also discussing to see how we can help Charlie Hebdo to survive and to go on. We have to be firm. We really have to be firm on our values and on our beliefs and our values are free expression as a foundation of democratic life and democratic debate. And Le Monde will be just one of the teams helping Charlie Hebdo to produce 1 million copies for next week’s memorial issue. just a sense they are of the view is at Le Monde. I am now being told there are 88,000 members of the police and military forces engaged in this operation. That is right across France. Lots of them are focused north and north-east of Paris, where the search is happy -- happening. Damien grammatical is has the latest. Here is what we know. In the last 21+ hours police have made nine detentions in relation to these attacks. Most of those in this area, people related to those two brothers. What has been happening here, we understand police may have completed their searches through the village of Longpont. They may now be moving towards the forests nearby. They may have a report of two men seen reports -- They may have a report of two men seen reports -- walking into the forest. It is freezing cold tonight. With resources being devoted to finding these men, it is hard to believe they could last longer out there if that is where they have gone. Damien, thank you. Any updates, you will get them on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from the BBC News at Six. So it’s goodbye from me, and on BBC Tonight on BBC London News: Tributes to the victims of the Paris shootings, as the Met observes a minute’s silence at Scotland Yard. Everybody in London stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Paris. We all feel the same sense of outrage about what has happened. We very much feel with the families of the victims of Charlie Hebdo. We’ll have the latest on the security situation as armed police patrols are stepped up at St Pancras International. Plus: I’m live at the French Embassy, where this afternoon the Home Secretary Theresa May was among those to sign a book of condolence. And, the defiant London cartoonists who say they won’t be censored. People have responded since the attack with cartoons and with illustrations. Ijust attack with cartoons and with illustrations. I just think, illustrations. Ijust think, you have got to fight back. Also on the programme: Plans to give Greenwich Power Station a new lease of life - fuelling the capital’s tube network. And, window dressing. The over-60s artwork going on display at Selfridge’s. Good evening, and welcome to the programme. I’m Louisa Preston. Tributes have been paid in London Tributes to the 12 victims of yesterday’s massacre in Paris. As a day of mourning was held in France, and a minute’s silence was observed at locations here in the capital, including Scotland Yard and City Hall. At the French Embassy in Kensington, a book of condolence has opened this evening. And tonight there’s been further condemnation of the attacks from London’s Muslim community. More on that shortly, but first Victoria Hollins reports on a day of reflection. Across London, it was a minute that PHY Across London, it was a minute that pay tribute to 12 lives lost empowers. Silence, from Scotland Yard to South Kensington. London has been described as France’s sixth city with an estimated 250,000 French people living here. Today, they marked the tragedy as if they were in their home country. Including this woman, who has run a French book shop. For more than 20 years. Was a sad day. A sad day for France and for the whole world. If you take liberty of expression, what else is there? Run the corner, the impact is clear before you even walk through the gates. Here, they too are Charlie Hebdo. Reference to the magazine where the 12 victims work. They held a minute’s silence to mark this was achieved. All the children in French schools, and I think in other schools, in French schools, and I think in otherschools, had other schools, had to that freedom is in danger with that sort of crime and that sort of tragedy. So, I think it is our duty to explain that very carefully. The solidarity in London was almost immediate, with a vigil in Trafalgar Square last night. journalist Mark Rush said France can learn a lot from the way London has dealt with its own terrorist attacks. The reaction of the French has been influenced by what they have seen in the reaction of the British during the 7/7 terrorist attack. Which is resolution, but also that life continues as usual. You can’t stand still, being dictated to. You have just got to get on with your life. It wasjust cold-blooded just got to get on with your life. It was just cold-blooded killing. There will become the cuts all over Europe. People of London should be afraid, because thou art all sorts of lunatics out there -- afraid, because thou art all sorts of lunatics out there -- copycats. I am not feeling worried about what could happen in London. The solidarity shown in central London yesterday is being shown politically too. Everyone in London stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Paris. We all feel the same sense of outrage about what has happened, our thoughts are very much with the families of the victims at Charlie Hebdo. These are great cities that Saddam for freedom and for free speech. -- Saddam for freedom and for free speech. -- that stand for freedom. The French community will have opportunities to pay respect in the coming days. Well, in a moment we’ll get the latest on the security situation from our Home Affairs Correspondent Guy Smith at Scotland Yard. But first to Tarah Welsh, who’s at the French Embassy in Knightsbridge, where a book of condolence has been opened. Well, that’s right. It is quite clear that something extraordinary has happened here. There are armed police outside the front door. They wouldn’t normally be here. The flags flying at half-mast. Hanging from the balcony of the sign ""je suis Charlie"". A sign that has come to show a sign of respect for what happened yesterday. A book of condolences also opened here. We have had ambassadors from across the world, the Home Secretary Theresa May keen to sign it, and the Merit London Borisjohnson. They spoke we flee to the French ambassador. The people here have told us they are really grateful for the support of Londoners. We have been really touched by all the support we had from Londoners. Obviously from the top level, have Majesty the Queen. Also from ordinary Londoners who have sent a semi-nice messages of support. -- have sent a semi-nice messages of support. -- so many nice messages of support. The Mayor of London came here, and left very nice flowers, and signed a book of condolence. The Home Secretary as well came to sign the book. We have been very touched, we have been -- the book. We have been very touched, we have been -- we haven’t been surprised, because we have a great friendship between our two nations. As you can imagine, there is a rather sombre atmosphere inside. People speaking in whispered words. One conversation I overheard was someone saying to the French ambassador, it is a shame it takes something like this to bring us together. That is the feeling that you get. People have been outside leaving flowers. People want to be ",,

There are 88,000 members of the police and armed forces involved in the operation across France - many of them in a region north of Paris where the suspects were last seen. The two brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi, are French citizens of Algerian descent - one was known to French anti-terror police. At noon there was silence in Paris and throughout the country as people observed a minute’s silence for the victims of the attack on a satirical magazine. ie je Suis Charlie. I am Charlie.

And plans to revamp Greenwich Power Station to help run the Tube. Good evening from Paris. We’re in the heart of the French capital, outside the Elysee Palace, where President Hollande is tonight following every stage of the nationwide security operation prompted by yesterday’s terrorist attack. 12 people were killed when two gunmen broke into the offices of a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo. The two suspects have now been named as Cherif and Said Kouachi, two brothers. They’re French citizens of Algerian descent. They’re still on the run. They were spotted at a petrol station some Ao miles from Paris at Villers-Cotterets. Armed police have also been searching in a forest north-east of the capital. Our correspondent Damian Grammaticas has the latest on the hunt for the suspects. Swooping low, police hunting the Paris attackers today. An hour’s drive outside the city, a petrol station, and it seemed they were a couple of hours behind their suspects, as they look through security camera footage there were fears that the men were heading back towards Paris. The manager said the men, still carrying Kalashnikovs had stolen food and fuel this morning. So military helicopters, doors opened, armed soldiers visible inside flew low over the road, looking for a grey Renault getaway car. The two suspects, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, are French Algerian, both in their 30s. Cherif had ties to militant groups. He appeared in this documentary about jihadis and wasjailed for three years for helping send young French Muslims to fight in Iraq. By early afternoon, anti-terror units were converging on one village, Longpont. Once in the village, they moved in, cautiously. The officers know the attackers have already killed two policemen, one executed in cold blood, and they fear what they will do if they are cornered. Officers blocked all roads to the village. This is as close as we can get, the road down to the village of Longpont, sealed off. The armed police we have seen in the area all day have converged on there, and that is where they are focusing the search. This local man said the police were going door to door, checking every house, so for a second night, France remains on its highest alert and the killers are still on the loose, but the net may be closing. At noon today much of this city came to a standstill, as did villages, towns and cities across France as people responded to the president’s call for a minute’s silence to remember the victims. This was the worst terrorist attack in France for half a century and the public response has been notable for the dignified determination shown by many tens of thousands, not to be intimidated. Our Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt, reports on the day the French mourned the loss of victims of terrorism. The deep bells of Notre Dame mark France’s day of mourning. At midday, hundreds of people stood in silence, with the only sound - rain on umbrellas. Strained faces remember the 12 people killed at the office of the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, yesterday. Many held the journalist’s pencil in support of free speech. They finished with applause for those who died in a terrorist attack. I feel we need to protect freedom in France. Some people want to break that and we have to fight for freedom. #jeSuisCharlie. I am Charlie, wherever you are in the world. This is a tragic event. And I am going to march on Saturday to show my defiance to murderers and evil fundamentalists. The French president, Francois Hollande, was at police headquarters. Two officers were killed in yesterday’s attack. More pictures emerged of the some killed yesterday. Including the only woman to lose her life. And today a photograph was released of the entrance to the room where the editorial meeting was taking place and where the gunmen opened fire. In Paris, there was another shooting. Early morning, police went to the southern suburb of Montrouge. A policewoman and a police colleague were shot by a man with an assault rifle. Heavily armed police units arrived as a search for the gunmen, and once again, residents in the French capital had witnessed shooting again on their streets. TRANSLATION: I heard three shots. I went down and saw a policewoman lying on the floor and someone was trying to resuscitate her. Someone went and called an ambulance. After the phone calls were made that to police officers were shot, ~ -- two - - two police anti-terrorist officers rushed to the scene and an investigation began as to what the significance of this was. The police do not believe there was a direct link with yesterday’s attack, but they have opened an antiterrorist investigation. The police woman later died of her injuries. In the face of these attacks, the French political establishment has tried to give a united response. Today the former French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was invited back to the Elysee Palace. TRANSLATION: Civilised people, Palace. TRANSLATION: Civilised people, whatever their conviction, should unite in the face of this fanatic barbarity.

It will defy its attackers by next week publishing a special edition with a print run of1 million copies. Tonight the Eiffel Tower dimmed its lights in tribute to those who had died. France has one of the biggest Muslim communities in Western Europe - some 5 million strong- and Muslim leaders have expressed fears that their people will face a backlash, despite condemning the attacks in the strongest possible terms and upholding the right to freedom of speech. Our special correspondent Fergal Keane reports on the response among the Muslim leaders. Banlieue - it means suburb. But it’s a word often loaded with negative associations. In the minds of some French, these estates can be a breeding ground for radicalism. Here in this northern suburb, Cherif Kouachi, one of the alleged attackers, lived quietly before becoming one of the most wanted men in France. His neighbours remember him as polite and kind. TRANSLATION: He was nice, correct and clean. And very helpful with disabled people. I saw him here every day. The last time was three days ago. There is shock here and amongst some Muslims I spoke to, a fear that attacks like this threaten their place in France. This woman was too afraid to show her face.

The challenge for the French government is notjust a security one. It is to make those who feel alienated, who owe no allegiance to the French state feel part of a French identity. Fergal Keane, BBC News, Paris. We learned that one of the brothers was certainly known to the authorities in France because he had been prosecuted in 2008 for trying top send fighters to Iraq. It now transspires tonight, the Americans are confirming that both brothers in fact were on a no-fly list. They had both been identified as potentially dangerous people. They are still on the run tonight. We will go now to Longpont, a village north-east of Paris. Damian Grammaticas is there with the latest on the hunt for us. Yes, the village of Longpont is up the road just behind me there. This is where today we have seen military helicopters circling in that village, teams going door-to-door and this evening moved into the forest next to it. Within the last hour a convoy, perhaps 30 police vehicles, has pulled out of here. So signs that they are scaling down the operation but in just the last five minutes we have seen police dog teams here, too. So what is certain - well what seems to be clear is that the robbery that happened, that hold-up at the petrol station, ten or I5 minutes down the highway, sources are saying to French media they are pretty certain that that was the two brothers who conducted that. Remember, police were looking at the CCTV footage. So they seem clear about that, but it seems also clear tonight that they don’t know exactly where those men they are hunting for are, despite the resources they are devoting to this. Thank you very much. Other European states have been reassessing the level of terrorist threat in their own countries. The truth, according to the head of MI5, in London, is that the terrorist threat is growing. Andrew Parker said tonight that it wasn’t possible to stop everything that might present a threat to the UK. Our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, is at MI5 headquarters in London tonight. This evening in a speech behind closed doors here at MI5, the head of the Security Service issued a warning of a growing, complex terrorist threat and one that his organisation is finding increasingly hard to cope with. It was a speech planned before yesterday’s attacks in a neighbouring capital but those shootings have brought home the reality of the UK threat. A visible and armed police presence at the Eurostar in London. Part of enhanced security at borders, ports and terminals, following the attack in France which the head of MI5 said ""was a terrible reminder of the intentions of those who wish to do us harm."" In his speech to a small audience, Andrew Parker revealed that in recent months alone police and MI5 have stopped three UK terrorist plots from which deaths would certainly have resulted. But, he added a stark warning, ""We cannot hope to stop everything"", he said. Mr Parker said that while the number of crude but potentially deadly plots has gone up, Britain still faces more complex and ambitious plots, including Al-Qaeda planning mass casualty attacks against the West. Syria and Iraq remain the largest source of the problem. At least 600 Britons have gone out there to become involved in violence, the MI5 chief revealed today. Some may come back a threat. Others here may simply be inspired by the message of those out there. Andrew Parker tonight said that his most serious concern was the growing gap between this worsening threat and MI5’s diminishing ability to deal with it. This, he said, was due to new forms of communication, especially over the internet which the state is finding it harder to intercept. But, are the Security Services looking in the right places? One of the men behind the Paris attacks was already known to the French authorities. Should they have kept closer tabs? That same question was asked after the Woolwich attack when two men who were known to MI5 killed Lee Rigby. And it was also asked after the july 7th 2005 bombings. One MP who overseas the work of Britain’s spies has concerns that lessons from these attacks in London about the need to check up on suspects have not been learnt and need to be. The processes that didn’t work as well as they should have done then, on this occasion, all these years later, still didn’t work as well as they should have done. And that’s why I think it’s a very urgent task that needs to be addressed. To prioritise the right people and investigate them in the right way? To prioritise the right people as well as the networks. At MI5, they are stretched at the moment. The pace in intense and tonight its head said his service and the whole country were facing what he called ""a long haul"" when it came to the terrorist threat. Well, we will have more from Paris a little later in the programme. Now back to London. There’s uncertainty over the General Election leaders debates tonight, after David Cameron said he wouldn’t take part unless the Green Party was included. He was speaking after the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom ruled the Greens were not a ""major party"". By contrast, UKIP has qualified for major party status, for the first time. Here’s our Political Editor, Nick Robinson. Rememberthis? Remember this? Well, don’t Rememberthis? Well, don’t take granted that you will see another TV leaders debate in this year’s general election. It’s not that they weren’t popular, 22 million watched some or all of the three staged in the last campaign. And the leaders who took part were mighty enthusiastic. Orat who took part were mighty enthusiastic. Or at least they were, all those years ago. I think television debates would help engage the public, answer some of the questions are part of the election, would help bring the election live in some way. Today, David Cameron sounded awfully like a man laying the foundations for a failure to agree on who should take part in this year’s debates. The big broadcasters have proposed including the Ukip leader as well as Labour and the Lib Dems. I don’t think it would be right to have some minor parties like the Liberal Democrats and Ukip, if you don’t have other minor parties like the Greens. The problem with that is that the TV Watchdog said today that it sees the Greens as a minor party, but thinks that Ukip’s recent election successes makes them a major one. Not surprisingly, the Greens know whichjudgement they Not surprisingly, the Greens know which judgement they prefer. Mr Cameron obviously has his own political interests, that I’m prepared to give him credit for a few nights in that we would be failing democracy if we did not have a chance to put our case in the debates. Adding another leader sounds simple enough. But if the Greens are added, the Scottish National Party will demand that they should be as well. That leads some to conclude that Mr Cameron’s real motive is to scupper the whole idea. This is a Prime Minister running scared of the TV debates, trying to chicken out. He shouldn’t be doing it. It is almost comic, the idea that suddenly out of no where there is a great alliance between the Greens and the Conservative Party. He is using the Greens as an excuse not to have a debate with Ukip, he is chicken, running scared. Are his rivals being too cynical? The Prime Minister made clear today he would be happy with no debate at all, at least during the election campaign itself. I think it would be good to get these debates done before the election campaign proper. I think the election campaign should be about travelling around the country, listening and talking to people, rather than sitting in a television studio. What he didn’t say is what his advisers tell him in private, that debates could be good for his opponents and very risky for him. Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, has unveiled a major restructuring plan aimed at restoring profits and taking on its rivals. It involves closing over Ao unprofitable stores and cancelling the opening of A9 more. Investors have welcomed the move. Tesco’s share price rose sharply in response - up 15%, the biggest one-day increase since 1988. Our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed reports. It’s Christmas, and we’re here to help every step of the way. The lights are flickering back on at Tesco. After years of miserable news, customers are returning to Britain’s biggest retailer. Price cutting and more staff in the shops has given the supermarket a Christmas lift. The man who runs the business told me things were looking a little better. We put more than 6,000 more colleagues in our store to be serving customers, and we got very strong feedback from customers that they appreciated that, that it improved the customerjourney. We invested in making more things available and we invested specifically in things they were most looking for at Christmas time. Selling a few extra carrots, parsnips and Christmas puddings might be very well, but that on its own is not going to be enough to turn around this business. Remember last autumn, the accounting scandal. There have been endless profit warnings and falling sales foI’ ITI8I’Iy VEBFS. To truly recover, Tesco needs to do something much more radical. That includes selling off it’s £2 billion data business and closing its final salary pension scheme. But the really radical change is store closures, like here in Andover, where there are 11 Tescos within 30 miles. One has already closed, and Tesco is now looking at A3 further shop closures in the UK. In the town centre, people told us theyjust weren’t shopping in the same way any more. Smaller shops, more often, I would say. I don’t do a big shop. I do notice a lot of people don’t any more. We don’t do big shops, no. We don’t do any big shops. just stuff we need, really. Tesco is going further, and abandoning store openings. Like this one in Chatteris, near Cambridge. It has been built but today it emerged it will never open. Plans for A8 other stores have also been shelved, sometimes to the anger of local communities. Stores we announced today we will be closing are stores which are very unprofitable and are not stores we can see a way of making profitable. And with, you know, a huge and heavy heart, because of the impact that will have on colleagues and some of the communities in which the stores are, I have had to take the difficult decision. job losses are likely to follow, but Mr Lewis said front line staff will be protected. Tesco did say it would lower prices, after similar announcements by ASDA and Sainsbury’s. It’s going to be a new price war, as Britain’s biggest retailers fight it out for our custom. Oldham Athletic have pulled out of their attempt to offer the convicted rapist Ched Evans a return to professional football. The club said the decision not to sign him was taken after ""enormous pressure from sponsors and threats to staff. Ched Evans apologised this afternoon ""for the effects of his actions"", but said Oldham had been influenced by what he called ""mob rule"". This report from our Sports Editor Dan Roan contains some flash photography. Leaving home with his fiancee this morning, Ched Evans’ hopes of a return to the game were about to be dashed. A deal with Oldham Athletic, collapsing amid a storm of rancour and opposition. Proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club, and continued to be a divisive influence. As a consequence, the deal could not go ahead. We deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to ourfans, sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain. 83 days after he left prison, this afternoon came a first show of contrition by Evans towards the victim he wasjailed for raping. In a carefully worded statement, the 26-year-old said, whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned. Tonight, the head of the players union risked further controversy, by appearing to compare the case to the Hillsborough tragedy. He maintains his innocence? He wouldn’t have been the first person to have been found guilty, to have maintained their innocence and then be found right. We are talking about things in football, we know what was alleged to have happened at Hillsborough and it has come unravelling and we find it was very different to how it was portrayed at the time, indeed by the police at the time. Despite his goal-scoring ability, Evans has now been turned down by a host of clubs and tonight blamed what he called ""mob rule"" for the breakdown of his move to the League One side. The fact this protracted signing ended amid vicious threats aimed at staff here only underlines just how divisive the issue of Ched Evans’ future had become. A saga that’s done little for the reputation of his club, for football, and for certain sections of society. But sponsors who threatened to withdraw their investment in the League One club are now pleased. We’re glad that this is the decision that’s been arrived at. It might have taken a few days to get there, but we’d rather it took time and came to what, for us, would be the right decision. And so, one of the most controversial deals football has ever seen is finally off. Evans, left facing a future in the footballing wilderness. Let’s go back to our top story, and events in France. Well, at the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo, the profound shock and grief is mixed with defiance. The surviving team is producing a new edition with a print run of1 million copies, instead of the usual 60,000. But there are concerns that, faced with growing threats and violence, the press and media around the world are, in effect, censoring themselves to minimise any risk. Caroline Wyatt considers where the line is drawn between freedom of speech and causing offence. Today, Britain’s 3 million Muslims have felt under scrutiny, about their reaction to the killings and what they think about showing cartoons that caused offence to many Muslims. Islam avoids the use of any image of Prophet Muhammed, revered in Islam for delivering the Word of God. Any attempts to do picked him, to make a caricature, or have an artistic impression, it is always going to be flawed, because he is the epitome of duty in the human form. -- flawed, because he is the epitome of duty in the human form. -- beauty. At this mosque, in Birmingham, worshippers said those that carried out the killings in the name of God did not represent them. It is not in defence of our Prophet. Our Prophet would have been crystal clear and unequivocal in condemning any such action. That is not in the name of Islam at all. Muslims are sick of having their faith hijacked Islam at all. Muslims are sick of having theirfaith hijacked in having their faith hijacked in this manner. Minor ~ -- But many still criticised the decision to publish the cartoons. You know you’re going to offend so many people, why would you do that? It is like me going to my next-door neighbour and spitting outside her doorstep. The laws of the land that protect everybody’s freedom of worship are also the ones that protect freedom of speech, and that includes the right criticise, question and debate all religions, even, sometimes, the right to satirise them. It was the principle that the editor of Charlie Hebdo and his staff died for. This was Stephane Charbonnier, defiantly holding Stephane Charbonnier, defiantly holding up the issue, when their offices were firebombed as a result. In the UK, most newspapers decided not to republish the cartoons today. The previous attacks have had a bad effect on what newspapers in Britain and elsewhere in Europe are prepared to publish. In a sense, they have achieved a victory that I feel very uncomfortable about, they have had the effect of censoring us and something is publishing the sort of things we want to publish. The question many here and across Europe will be reflecting on is how to balance liberty with respect, without allowing extremists to silence the debate. With me tonight is our Europe editor Gavin Hewitt. All of the expressions of unity and solidarity we have heard, how robust are they? I thought one of the most moving images today were the lines of religious leaders from different faiths standing together and declaring unity. That, of course, is the big question. Will these attacks cause further divisions or bring people closer together? On the political front, people closer together? On the politicalfront, we had here today President Hollande meeting with his political foe, President Hollande meeting with his politicalfoe, Nicolas Sarkozy. But there was a rather different tone from the leader of the far right, Marine Le Pen. She said it was time France woke up to the threat of Islamic extremism and fundamentalism, and that denial was no longer a possibility. We hear echoes of those arguments, notjust here in France, but they are taking place are very vigorously, particularly in Germany. I think when these attacks are over, the big question will be, what will be the lasting impact Western Mark will it be to have brought some of these communities closer together? Or will it actually have some more divisions and have division communities further apart? That is the big question here. Gavin, thank you very much. That is all from Paris tonight. There are continuing updates on what is going on with that massive manhunt north of Paris, on BBC News online and the BBC News Channel. Now it is time tojoin the news teams where you are.

What happened yesterday was truly a disgusting and barbaric act. There is no two ways about it. I came to basically show my respect to those people that lost their lives. It’s really sad actually, and that’s the main reason why I came today. It’s not - main reason why I came today. It’s not - these people come in and killed people in the name of Is la. It is very upsetting to see people hUack It is very upsetting to see people hijack our religion in such a disgusting way when it is actually a religion of peace. I think it is important to show solidarity and our compassion with the victims and theirfamilies and compassion with the victims and their families and people all over the world and also to say that - whatever these criminal people did, it is definitely not in our name. It is more offensive for me, as a Muslim for them to do such a thing in the name of Islam, rather than any cartoon or any caricature. Let them do what they want to do, there is no compulsion, but this is definitely not the way to respond. Inside the Embassy a condolence book, signed by the Home Secretary and the Mayor of London. I have been really touched by all the support we have had from Londoners. Obviously from the top level, Her Majesty the Queen, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition sent us very nice messages of support but also from ordinary Londoners who have sent us so many nice messages of support and took part in vigils. It was very much appreciated. Across London it was a minute that paid tribute to the 12 lives lost. Sigh frens Scotland Yard to South Kensington.

London has been described as France’s sixth city with an estimated 250,000 French people living here. Today they marked the tragedy as if they’d beenin they marked the tragedy as if they’d been in their home country. It was big devastation. We were devastated. It was a sad day, not only for France but I think for the whole world. Because, if you take liberty of expression, what else do you have? A public book of condolence will open at the French Institute tomorrow at lunch time. Until then people have been finding their own way to express twhar grief and sorrow. It’s been revealed a man who collapsed after being assaulted outside a social club in Guildford, died from head injuries. lI6-year-old Richard Stroud was pronounced dead in hospital early on Sunday. He was one of three men assaulted outside the club. 32-year-old Matthew Boyd has been charged with his murder. Luton Airport has launched a £100 million plan to boost the number of passengers who use it to 18 million by 2026. The airport’s already seen passenger numbers increase by 8% last year - after introducing 15 new destinations. Ten new routes have been confirmed for this year. Plans for Greenwich power station to provide cleaner, cheaper energy for London’s tube network and 20,000 homes have been unveiled today. The proposals are part of City Hall’s pledge to reduce pollution levels. Karl Mercer has this report. OK Mr Bond, it’s curtains for you! If only all power came at the push of a button. This morning at least, the Mayor had nothing standing in his way. Take this baby up to 900 revs! That would be cool! These current turbines and engines are the back-up in case of a power cut on the tube. They haven’t been used for years. This is it. The gas turbine. The plan now is to put six new greenerturbines in, which will eventually power parts of the Underground. It could power about 13% of the tube. That is the ambition, which is huge. The tube takes as much juice, as much of the energy, electricity as the whole of Leeds, by the way. So, this is the future. What we are going to do is put in clean, green, gas-fired power, ultimately hoping that it will be renewable. This currently disused hall is where the new turbines will go. You can see why this was called a cathedral of power when it was built back in 1906. It is hoped that heat from the turbines could now warm up to 20,000 homes. We want to get the power from the station to local homes. You know, it’s great that it puts 13% of electricity in terms of emergency to keep the tube going. You know, CCTV, ventilation. But actually, it has got so much more, you know, potential, for taking energy into people’s homes. And everybody knows the cost of energy. Work will begin here in April, with the first power being generated from 2017. A new lease of life in the hall that used to power London’s trams. Crystal Palace’s new manager, Alan Pardew, has spoken of his determination to take the club out of the relegation zone. Pardew is the Premiership side’s fourth manager injust over 15 months. It’s been a long time since I played here. I like to think I’m coming back as a better manager than I was as a player. Hopefully we can go on a run that gets us at least to safety. Well that’s it for now from me. Let’s find out what the weather is up to with Louise Lear. A wet start but it got better. A bit of everything today and a similar story for tomorrow. Clouding over, there will be outbreaks of light, patchy rain by the end of the afternoon. We have rain through the night but we start off tomorrow on a cloudy note. Lovely sunshine by the middle of the day. Make the most of it. The cloud returns. Outbreaks of showery rain move in from the north throughout the afternoon but an incredibly mild afternoon, 11-146789 all change as we move into the second half, though, as Saturday brings some wet and wind which weather. We could see gusts of winds to 55 miles per hour first thing on Saturday morning and some of the rain really heavy. It sweeps away rather sharpish by lunch time on Saturday. All change yet again. Westerly winds swing around to a north-westerly. It is actually going to get colder on Saturday as the day continues. But hopefully the sunshine will compensate, highs of 6-8. Let’s look at the outlook - Sunday looks cool and crisp and here is more detail with the national forecast. We have unsettled and turbulent weather on the cards for the next week or so. The imminent focus will be very strong wind. We have wind warnings issued from the Met Office. You can see where they are, across much of Scotland into the far north of England, the far north of Northern Ireland, too. Yellow warnings in first and amber warnings in the areas where we are likely to seat strongest wind gusts. The strong winds are down to an area of low pressure that has been rapidly deepening over the past 24 hours, as it moves towards the north of the UK. So tight isobars bringing gusty conditions. We have rain around and hill fog for Scotland, moving quickly hill fog for Scotland, moving quickly west to east. But it is the strong winds that will cause most of the problems as we head through the early hours of Friday. We could see the winds gusting as much as 100 miles per hour across some places in the north of Scotland. More typically around 70 to 80 miles per hour gusts possible right across the central belt of Scotland through around about four or 5.00pm. But the winds will tend to ease for most places once the sun comes up. At 8.00pm. Some sunshine across Scotland and Northern Ireland. Wintry showers and windy conditions in the north-east. Around Wales, a quiter start to the day. After the overnight wind and rain, temperatures still in double figures. It will be a Bustery day but some sunshine on offer. A lot of dry and bright weather for many central and eastern areas, but the next batch of the rain in the west later in the day. This rain could be heavy for the hills of western Scotland down towards Cumbria as well. To the south of that, drizzly, 9""âY well. To the south of that, drizzly, grey and mild, around 1-14. But breezy wherever you are. Now the mild air in charge on Friday won’t be hanging around too long. We have a cold front approaching from the north-west and that will introduce much colder air as we look forward into the weekend. For Saturday, some squally winds and weather associated with that cold front. Then we are left in the clearer, brighter, fresher conditions but a return to wintry showers. Some snowfall on the hills. Even a little snow at lower levels and iciness in the north-west. Brighterand levels and iciness in the north-west. Brighter and drier towards the south-east. For Sunday another fairly breezy day. Some sunshine in the north and east, more in the wet weather towards the north-west. Temperatures on the cooler side.

Our hashtag is BBCQT, follow us at BBC Question Time. Text comments to 83981, and use the red button to see what others are saying. Our first question is from Andrew Burgess, please. Is there anyway to stop the type of attack that happened France? David Davis? Iam afraid the short answer is no. In a free society, people are going to be able to get around, moved in an unfettered way. And to make the sort of monstrous surprise attack we all saw in the last couple of days. It is notjust in a free society. If you look at places like Russia, where they have massive controls on the population, you still have Chechen terrorist attacks happening. So the answer is no. I think the first thing to say is that we should recognise that what we should not do is to react to them in the belief that we can stop them. The simple truth is that they are trying to do a number of things, create a monstrosity that will attract attention, dominate headlines and so on, trying to make us behave in a certain way. Trying to make us behave in a way which is alien to our culture, give up ourfreedom, habeas corpus, privacy, give up the things that people desperately do to stop this sort of attack. I am afraid the terrible answer is no. It does not mean we cannot defeat their ideology, their ideas, their barbarian approach, but to make any country completely safe is beyond the reach of any government. APPLAUSE And do you think in any way publishers should modify what they publish? No, not for one... Ifl publishers should modify what they publish? No, not for one... If I had been able to orchestrate one reaction to yesterday, I would have wanted every single editor in every newspaper in Europe and the rest of the world to agree to carry their cartoons on that day. APPLAUSE Because you BECAUSE YOU CSI’] BECAUSE YOU CAI’] SEE, OI’] Because you can see, on Twitter and in the commentary that has gone on in the background, people saying we must not be frightened of this. But people also saying, but if we do it, we put ourselves at the front of the queue to be killed. I think it is really important we stand together a really important that when we say we stand shoulder to shoulder with the French, we mean it and show it in what we do. The person in the middle. I am a Muslim and really very angry about not many Muslims out there speaking. It is shocking what happened yesterday and more Muslims need to come out and condemn what happened. You can’t have a small community representing 2 billion people. It is important that Muslims come out and condemn what happened. APPLAUSE julia Hartley-Brewer. julia Hartley- Brewer. I wholeheartedly with David that if only the newspapers had not bottled it, as they did today. I understand why they bottled it. That would be part of a way of stopping future attacks having an effect. There will always be some nutters who are going to try and kill people, and sometimes they will succeed. In a way, in a free society where people can walk freely into offices and shopping centres, it is extraordinary that we have not seen more atrocities and greater atrocities. That is some small mercy. But we have to accept the fact that we are allowing these attacks to actually affect us. While we can’t prevent them, we need to prevent them from affecting us. The ",,

We’ll have a full weather forecast in half an hour. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC news at One. The japanese Prime Minister has condemned as ""despicable"" the latest threat by Islamic State to kill one of his countrymen. Militants said yesterday they’d execute Kenji Goto within 24 hours, along with a jordanian pilot, if an Iraqi woman being held in jordan isn’t released. This morning, jordan said it would be willing to hand over the woman in exchange for the pilot, but no mention was made of the japanese hostage. Our correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes sent this report. As the new deadline set by Islamic State approached, people gathered for a candlelit vigil outside the Prime Minister’s office in Tokyo. Speculation has been swirling here that a deal may be close to free japanese hostage, Kenji Goto. There is also a deep anxiety that time is running out for the japanese journalist. Today, his mother made another heart-rending plea for her son to be saved. TRANSLATION: Dear Prime Minister, please save my son’s life. Kenji only has a little time left. All responsibility is on me. This all follows the release of a new video of Mr Goto with new demands. Islamic State saysjordan has until this afternoon to release this Iraqi suicide bomber from jail, or two hostages will be killed. One is Mr Goto. The other is this jordanian fighter pilot who was shot down and caught by Islamic State last year. In Amman, japan’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Yasuhide Nakayama, refused to give any indication of whether a deal is close. ""It is an ongoing situation,"" he says, ""so I cannot comment."" ""We are doing everything we can to gain Mr Goto’s freedom"". The jordanian government is now in a pretty impossible position. If it does not release convicted suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, Islamic State will kill both hostages. If it does release her, Islamic State says it will hand over Mr Goto, but it has made no similar promise about the pilot- only not to kill him. For manyjordanians, that is a very bad deal. Forjapan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, these are also very tense times. If Mr Goto is killed, manyjapanese people may blame Mr Abe and his policy of supporting the US-led war against Islamic State. Well, our Middle East correspondent Yolande Knell has just arrived injordan. You have just been talking to the family of the jordanian pilot held by Islamic State. What did they tell you? I was with the relatives of Moaz al-Kasasbeh as new of-- news of the latestjordanian government statement came through. It gave them some hope of a remaining steamy cautious start the latest video that come from Islamic State does not even talk about freeing this young pilot, only about sparing his life. At the moment, we still don’t have a response from Islamic states themselves in relation to what the jordanian officials are now saying. When I spoke to the father of this pilot, he told me his son must be released at any price. He also questioned the role his son was playing in northern Syria in the bombing campaign against Islamic State. He said in his view, jordan should not be part of the US-led coalition. What is really worrying for thejordanian government now is thatitis for thejordanian government now is that it is a view you are finding more and more on thejordanian streets. Thank you forjoining us. Well, with me now is our security correspondent Frank Gardner. Western governments have made a big play of not giving into Islamic State demands but it looks like jordan well. There’s a lot of pressure onjordan jordan well. There’s a lot of pressure on jordan from pressure onjordan from the Americans, who don’t publicly, at least that is their policy, along with Britain, make substantive concessions to kidnappers. But I think some people would say this is a double standard because you look at the man who was released by the Taliban a few months ago in return for the release of five senior Taliban commanders from one can obey. It is difficult tojordan. They are in the Western camp, part of the US-led coalition against Islamic date, but many of their people don’t understand why they are taking part. -- people don’t understand why they are taking part. -- Islamic State. Back to Sajida al-Rishawi, who they want out, she is a failed would-be suicide bomber. 65 people died when other people in her group detonated explosives. On the one hand, you have the relatives of thejordanian pilot asking for him to be let go but it would be interesting to hear what the relatives of those victims have to say. Thank you forjoining us. NHS bosses have issued new guidelines to some hospitals over when they can declare a ""major incident"" or crisis. The new rules, issued by West Midlands NHS, include 17 criteria - drawn up after a spate of hospitals recently announced ""major incidents"" because of pressure on bed spaces. Our political correspondent Chris Mason has more. In the political foreground again. The NHS is once more grabbing attention. Our hospitals in the West Midlands being put off declaring they are struggling by new rules? Can he explain why new guidance has been issued to some hospitals making it harderfor them to been issued to some hospitals making it harder for them to declare a major incident? Let me answer that very directly. The NHS in the West Midlands, without any instruction from the Department of Health or from ministers, issued a statement about major incidents. In an e-mail exchange seen by the BBC, a senior manager says the enhanced criteria effectively stop trusts calling a major incident. A senior doctor adds, ""it strikes me as an attempt to dampen down the heat and media attention"". Declaring a major internal incident allows a hospital to flag up that it is struggling, to prioritise emergency care, and seek help from neighbouring hospitals. But the government insists it is a decision taken locally and not by them. So this is the question: Have NHS managers been lent on by their political masters? There has been no political pressure. It is disappointing some of the doctors in the West Midlands think that is the reason for this. This is absolutely a local initiative in the West Midlands, to help hospitals and the wider health community to do the best they can for patients. This is not the end of it, though. The Health Secretary has been caught the parliament to explain what is going on, too. MPs will spend much of the rest of the day debating the NHS. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor, Norman Smith. You have got more details of these guidelines that have been issued. It has been a bit like pit bull prime Mr’s questions, today, the ferocity of the exchanges over the issue. In the last few minutes, Labour have issued more from this 86 page dossier, issued by the West Midlands NHS, setting out the criteria before hospitals can declare a major incident. One section seems to suggest that clinicians should take account of the possible political and media reaction. Let me read you the section which comes under the headline Politics, and it asks health bosses to consider, "" is their political involvement or excessive media coverage? Is there a requirement to bolster or reassure public confidence? Is there a risk of reputational damage?"" In other words, think about the likely media reaction if you declare a major incident and the politics of the situation. On the face of it, this would all seem a clear win the Labour on their chosen theme of the NHS. But the thing is I’m on my scent is Labour’s offensive on the NHS is beginning to become snarled UP NHS is beginning to become snarled up and slowed down because of one word: Weaponised. Again and again, Mr Cameron challenged Mr Miliband in the Commons, whether it was true that he had told Nick Robinson that he wanted to weaponised the NHS as an issue. Until Mr Miliband can come UP an issue. Until Mr Miliband can come up with an answer to that charge, it seems to me that it will be hard for him to hit home on the NHS. Thank you forjoining us. Ambulance response times in Wales have hit their lowest point ever, according to new figures this morning. Last month, just over 42% of the most urgent calls received a response within eight minutes. That’s compared with 51% in November, and well below the target of 65%. Here’s our correspondent Hywel Griffiths. The emergency service, in need of urgent help. Winter always brings extra pressure on paramedics, but in Wales, the Ambulance Service has just had its worst ever month. It has probably been the most difficult period in the last six weeks that I have known in nearly 30 years. Simply because of the volume of people, we are seeing, many of whom are quite sick. And the time delay in being able to respond to them. lI92-year-old Gwen Charles, the delay was excruciating, after she fell and broke her hip in the garden, with no amulet is responding. It was two and a half hours before they moved, they came and moved her. She was on the floor. She was cold and damp. We had to put blankets on her and use hot water bottles. When life is endangered, the target for ambulance crews in Wales is to reach 65% of patients eight minutes. In November, performance fell tojust patients eight minutes. In November, performance fell to just 51%, and patients eight minutes. In November, performance fell tojust 51%, and in December, a record low, just 42.6% of calls. In some parts of Wales, less than 30% of emergency calls got a response within eight minutes. The Ambulance Service say that is not acceptable but point to a record number of calls. This is not the only part of the country struggling at the moment. Infact, 11 ofthe UK’s 14 Ambulance Services are failing to reach their targets. The CoUege failing to reach their targets. The College of paramedics say the problem is notjust growing demand but a shortage of staff. The frustration is that they are outside the A&E Department, with quite sick patients for an hour or two in the most extreme cases and all they can hear is the control centre asking for people available for series called. That adds to being Guy Thys of staff. In Wales, more money has been promised for emergency care, but with the number of 999 calls increasing, there is no sign of the pressure easing on the front line. Greece’s new Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras has told his first cabinet meeting that the country will not default on its debts. The leader of the left-wing Syriza government said he wanted to reach a fair and mutually beneficial solution with the Eurozone on Greece’s multi-billion pound bailout. Lets talk to our correspondence in Athens. A conciliatory tone from Alexis Tsipras but how does this square with his essential anti-austerities message? It is a difficult balancing act. To a certain extent, an olive branch was extended from Athens to Berlin and Brussels today. Alexis Tsipras said they would not get into a mutually destructive clash but they will not continue a policy of subjugation. An attempt to balance his defiance against austerities, a desire for a cut in the debt with a reassurance to his Eurozone colleagues that he would soon be walk away and stop answering the phone. That has not reassured the stock market in Greece. It is down by 10% today. What is likely to come out of this is a classic Eurozone fudge, in which neither side wants to lose face. Possibly, Greece’s loans could have a low interest rate or possibly a longer repayment period. But I don’t foresee any attempt or desire in northern Eurozone countries to write off a massive chunk of Greece’s debt. Certainly not the 150 billion euros that he is pushing for. Ultimately, both sides want Greece to stay in the Euro which is the strength of his negotiating position but it might come down to a game of who will blink first in the end. Apple has announced an $18 billion quarterly profit- that’s almost £12 billion - making it the biggest profit ever made by a public company. The firm says it’s down to record-breaking sales of the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus. For the first time, sales in China were higher than those in the United States. Our business correspondent Emma Simpson reports. This is the new iPhone. They are the latest Apple devices with bigger screens and better technology. These mobiles are not cheap but they are selling like hot cakes, driving Apple’s record profits. Injust three months, it sold a total of 75 million iPhones. That boosted quarterly revenues by nearly a third, to £49 billion. Astounding results from Apple today. It really is remarkable that they could even physically ship as many iPhone for a macro as they did, 74.5 live. Think about the logistics of getting them to all those different places. They are rapidly catching up with the biggest player, Samsung and a few years ago, that was on thing Kabul. In China, they could not wait to get their hands on the latest iPhones which has boosted profits. It is also quite a turnaround in Apple’s fortunes in this crucial market. TRANSLATION: Ijust want fortunes in this crucial market. TRANSLATION: I just want to play games. All the mobile phones are similar nowadays. The iPhone attracts me because of its functions are playing games. TRANSLATION: It is now the era of Apple, it has conquered the world. This company has been making the equivalent of £5 million worth of profit for every hour of the day. It is swimming in cash. But these incredible figures will raise yet more questions about how much tax Apple pays and where. It is already the world’s most valuable company, worth £429 billion. If you want a comparison, thatis billion. If you want a comparison, that is nearly doubled Denmark’s total economic output. But as Apple’s profits soar, the spotlight could well switch to its finances as well as its phones. Our top story...

The blizzard which narrowly missed New York yesterday has dumped up to a metre of snow across other parts of north-eastern America. Large areas of New England are struggling to cope with the heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions. Some areas are at risk of flooding and there are winds of more than 60 miles per hour. In New York, the mayor has denied over-reacting after a ""potentially historic blizzard"" failed to hit the city. Our correspondent, Ben Geoghegan, repoorts. Notjust wind, notjust Not just wind, not just water, snow and ice covering everything. Elegant houses in Massachusetts look more like Frosty Toons after temperatures plummeted.

I am glad we had some advance warning and I think that will help us in terms of our ability to get out of it early. In Boston, 80 miles an hour winds caused power cuts to homes and businesses. One resident shot this video of her front garden as it disappeared under a blanket of snow. The storm pushing its way up the north-east coast has left people digging theirway the north-east coast has left people digging their way through deep banks of snow. Eight states declared an emergency and imposed travel bans. School closures in New York meant a family day out in Central Park. The subway was closed for the first time in its history because of snow. The weather was not nearly as bad as predicted and the mayor has been forced to explain himself. Which you rather be prepared or not prepared? Safe or not safe? I would always on the side of safety and caution. Snow still lies in thick piles. In some places people will be thankful that this time the weather forecasters got it wrong. And we’ll be live in Boston later in the programme. Figures analysed by the BBC show that the amount spent in England on social care for each person aged 65 and over has fallen by 20%. Social care experts say it shows the huge pressure the system is under. Today, the BBC is launching an online calculator to help you work out the costs you might face in later life. Our Social Affairs Correspondent, Alison Holt, has more. Hello. Have you woken up? Bill Galley is 71 years old and has dementia. His wife, Viv, had to give up work four years ago to care for him. I came home one day and he had put the kettle on the cooker, so the kettle was melted to the cooker. Well... Well. .. That was it, Ijust That was it, I just had to That was it, Ijust had to stop work then. Like many people, she had little idea of the costs of care. They had savings, so at first were not entitled to local authority help. Paying for the extra support they needed has drained those savings in a way that has shocked her. When eventually we ran out of money completely, the social worker got Bill reassessed, and they now give us the full money, which is £1,700 a month. When Bill took ill, we had £46,000 in our savings. I thought, ""We’ll be fine, we’re all right,"" you know? But itjust goes. That is care at home, but in residential care, bosses also say few people realise that many of them will not qualify for council help. People will find that there are top-up payments to make sure the cost of care is being covered and good quality care can be provided, and certainly there is a wide range of costs across the country, and a very wide range of fees that local authorities will PaYÂ of fees that local authorities will pay, with no obvious logical root to the differences. For most of these pensioners, care costs are not something they have thought about. I guess I’ve got my head in the sand at the moment. I really haven’t thought about it. It would break my heart to sell mY It would break my heart to sell my house and leave nothing to my children. No, you’re pulling against me, aren’t you? Councils say they are chronically underfunded. In turn, the government says it has put more than £1 billion extra into social care in the last year alone. Whatever the arguments, families like the Galleys cope largely on their own for a long time. Sadly, in the last two weeks, Bill Galley has died. His family still wanted their story to be told. And Alison is with me now. Allison, let’sjust go back to Allison, let’s just go back to those figures I mentioned at the start, which is that local councils in England are spending 20% less per person than they were ten years ago. That sounds alarming. It gives us a picture of what the pressure from an ageing population does to social care spending. If I talk you through what that means in real terms, what we did is we went back to 2003 and looked at council spending and the population of 65 and over at that point in time. At that point, the amount being spent per person was 1188. Roll forward ten years and you do the same calculations. It was a full of 20%, £951. Also a 17% increase in the ageing population. The council say they are underfunded. The Government says it is putting money in but managed to be closer work between Health and Social Care Bill it is worth saying all the different nations within the UK are facing extra pressures from an ageing population. The care calculator has helped. The idea behind this is it explains the systems in the different parts of the UK. You put in your postcode and it gives information local to you. Take time to have a look and explore it and see what information it has about the costs of care and how it works. Well, you can find out more about the BBC Care Calculator at bbc. co. uk/ca re. The former rock star, Gary Glitter, who’s accused of indecent assault against three girls between 1975 and 1980, has broken down in court. Gary Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was asked about images of child abuse which were found on his computer. He denies the charges against him. More than a million adults in the UK may be wrongly receiving treatment for asthma, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It’s set out draft guidelines for doctors and other health workers in England, after finding that almost a third of people being treated for the condition weren’t actually showing symptoms. Our Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. Over four million adults in the UK are currently receiving treatment for asthma, an irritation of the lungs that causes small airways to become inflamed and narrow, making it difficult to breathe. But new guidance from the NHS watchdog NICE suggest that too many people are getting the wrong diagnosis. Many diagnoses of asthma are made on the basis of a history alone. We are saying it is very important that before a doctor makes a diagnosis of asthma, they have done some tests to ensure that asthma is what is causing this child or adult’s wheezing and breathlessness. NICE suggests that some people may have had asthma in the past, but that nearly a third of patients are no longer showing signs of the condition. That means more than a million adults in the UK could be wrongly receiving treatment. Conditions such as bronchitis and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder, also known as COPD, can display similar signs and symptoms to asthma. The point of the guidelines is to align not only on family history but clinical tests like this in order to build a more accurate picture. Some doctors are concerned that some patients may get the wrong message about risks associated with asthma. Three people a day die from asthma. From a review of asthma deaths published last year, it has demonstrated all these cases pretty much are avoidable. In a third of cases, they were hardly on any treatment at all at the time of death. What we do not want to happiness for asthma patients to taking treatment. The possible side effects of using an inhaler are greatly reduced compared with decades ago. Patients should consult their GP if they have concerns. Asthma UK says it is still under diagnosed and that eight out of ten patients are still not getting the correct basic care. Should they stay, or should they go? The future of a family of beavers in Devon will be decided today. They’re the first to be living in the wild anywhere in England for 500 years, but opinion is divided about them. The dams they build mean trees are felled and land is flooded, but they can be beneficial to other river residents. Our correspondent, Sarah Ransome, is in Ottery St Mary. Yes, and the fate of those speakers is the talk of the town is lunch time, in Ottery Saint Mary. What locals want time, in Ottery Saint Mary. What locals wa nt to locals want to know is if their new local residents can remain on the river bank. It is not entirely clear where this colony of beavers came from. Campaigners want them to stay. They are very important. They should be here. They have not been here for 400, 500 years, but they are back now and it gives us the opportunity to study the impact they have on a low land English landscape. That is a unique opportunity. In this footage, you can see how effective they are at gnawing their way through trees and bushes close to their adopted home. There were plans to track the colony and transfer them to a wildlife park. It was argued they were not the native species and could carry a disease lethal to humans. There was concern that the damage they could do to habitats. This was chiselled in probably less than an hour. Locals here have taken their new neighbours to heart. Natural England is meeting to decide if the beavers can stay on the river bank. Campaigners are hoping this new colony can remain where they have chosen to call home. We should get the results of that meeting later on this afternoon. Locals want a happy ending to this particular tale of the riverbank. Our top story: Fears grow for the safety of the japanese hostage held by Islamic state militants. japan has said it is willing to engage in a prisoner swap. Ina moment, In a moment, we will get a full national weather forecast, followed by the news where you are. But first, the day’s sport. Chelsea are through to the League Cup final but are waiting to see if their striker Diego Costa faces any punishment, after he appeared to stamp on two Liverpool players at Stamford Bridge last night. The FA will ask the referee, Michael Oliver for his observations, although he took no action last night. Costa could be found guilty of violent conduct. jose Mourinho says it was accidental. Branislav Ivanovic headed the winner in injury time for the only goal of the night as Chelsea went through 2-1 on aggregate. Cheslea will play the winners of tonight’s semi between Sheffield United and Tottenham, with Spurs leading 1-0 after the first leg. After Chelsea’s win, much of the focus centred on Costa’s actions. There was no need to do it. That is the sad thing. He’s a top-class player. He is clever enough if the officials don’t see it. But it is a shame because he’s an outstanding player, a top player and he does not need to do it. I don’t know what you understand by stamping. I think that maybe you are already influenced by, I’m going to use a word that gets me in trouble, but I think this time I cannot be punished by saying that there is a campaign on the TV with a certain pundit that is saying Diego Costa’s crimes. He must be nuts, the 9UY Costa’s crimes. He must be nuts, the guy that is saying that. There’s a surprise candidate for the Fifa presidency. The former World Footballer of the Year, Luis Figo is going to stand against Sepp Blatter. Figo says he has the required backing of five national associations and wants to clean up the organisation’s image, saying, ""If you search Fifa on the internet, you see the first word that comes out: scandal, not positive words."" He is one of five candidates expected to challenge Blatter in the May election. The England fast bowler Stuart Broad has apologised after making a comment about the UK minimum wage on Twitter. He posted ""I’ve heard if you earn minimum wage in England you’re in the top 10% earners in the world. #stay #humble."" He later deleted the post. ~ I was problem be a bit misguided, but it up there but I genuinely did not mean it in any other way that obviously being amazed by the numbers. That was it. I was a bit surprised about the size of the reaction it got. But I have apologised and everyone can see it on Twitter. There was an astonishing climax to cricket’s Big Bash T20 tournament in Australia. The Perth Scorchers looked sure of victory, needing two off the last four balls. But the Sydney Sixers’ Brett Lee, in his last over before retirement took two wickets in two balls. It was so nearly the fairy tale end to an incredible career. A hat-trick with his final delivery would have won it. The match was tied but the Perth batsman Yasir Arafat scrambled through for a single as Sixers fumbled the run-out. Scorchers the winners as they retained their Big Bash title. World No1 Novak Djokovic is into the semifinals of the Australian Open. He beat Canada’s Milos Raonic in straight sets. He only took the first on a tie-break but the four-time champion never looked back, taking the next two 6-4, 6-2. Each time Djokovic has made it to the final four, he’s taken the title. He faces the defending champion, Stan Wawrinka next. The American teenager Madison Keys has reached her first Grand Slam semifinal after beating Venus Williams in three sets. Next up is the other Williams sister, Serena. That’s all the sport for now. Back to you. Well let’s get more on that severe weather that’s hitting parts of America’s east coast. Our correspondent Gary O’Donoghue is in Boston. Gary, conditions are pretty serious, there. Actually, this is a big improvement, family enough, on what we had yesterday. The snow stopped falling in the early hours of the morning. It is very cold here, we are looking at about 8 degrees below freezing, centigrade, and with wind chill, possibly down to -20. Temperature will be a big issue but things are getting back to normal in a funny way. Traffic is back on the streets, and the driving ban that was imposed by the Governor and the mayor in Boston has been lifted. You can see people going about their business to a large extent. There’s a lot of snowploughs still out on the streets, clearing the snow, a lot of blowers. There’s one blowing snow out of the way over there. Things are gradually getting back to normal but schools are still shot, for example. The airport is opening, the trains are running, with some kind of service. A gradual return to normality. You say that, as we know, some criticism of the authorities for perhaps being overly pessimistic in their forecast will stop is it fair? Of course, New York did not get it in any sense as badly as it thought it would. Much less snow than they thought they were going to get which led to quite a lot of criticism, notjust of the mayor, build a lot of criticism, notjust of the mayor, build Abbasi, yesterday, they said they may have got something is wrong but what they mainly said was that they failed to explain to people that weather forecasts are just that, forecasts. They cannot absolutely predict things. The storm took a slightly different course. In Massachusetts, we got pretty much what we were expecting. A couple of towns and cities here, towards the east, 36 inches of snow, which is quite a lot. In Boston, we had 27 inches. It has been pretty bad in Massachusetts but frankly, they are used to this sort of thing. Thank you forjoining us. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Tomaz Schafernaker. We are going to have snow as well. But we are a hardy nation so I’m sure we can cope. At the moment, cold air is invading the UK. You can see on the satellite picture, the motion of the cloud coming out of the north-west. This is a cold front and everything behind it is cold air from the far north Atlantic. Strong winds across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England and you can see snow showers coming in. The Met office has issued an amber warning that snow could become troublesome in the next 18 hours. It is already impacting the rush-hour. Commuters, beware. This is what it looks like at about 5pm. I don’t think snow will be a major issue for this evening’s rush hour at least, not widely but still the warning is enforced so be prepared for some disruption in some places. That is for Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. For Wales and the south-east, ifanything, mainly sleep with some clear whether a round as well. Through tonight, the snow showers come in with more of a punch. It will be hit and miss. It is not one coherent area of snow, not one large area sliding down the country. It is very hit and miss so some places won’t get any snow at all. You can see the subzero temperatures across the north of the country. Across the hills of Scotland, possibly up to 15 centimetres, six inches. Then maybe five centimetres in some places across Northern Ireland, even down to town is a little bit lower down. Hit and miss across the North of England, Yorkshire getting some snow but south of that, we are not anticipating major problems. As we go through the weekend, we are expecting more snow flurries and heavy bursts of snow coming in from the North. They’re that in mind if you are travelling through Saturday and Sunday. On Thursday, you can see some snow showers moving a bit further south and the further south they go, the more likely they will turn to mucky rain, sleet, very unpleasant. In the north, more snow showers. This is what it will feel like, apart from the Channel Islands, who will feel a tropical1 degrees above freezing. Right into the weekend, from the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic on it is going to feel bitterly cold. When the wind comes from the north, we tend to get snow on the western side of the country and the East. I’m sure everyone will be doing that, tweeting. If you want to send us a picture, we all with love to see a bit of snow. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Fears grow for the safety of the japanese hostage being held by Islamic State militants. jordan says it’s willing to engage in a prisoner swap with IS. That’s all from us.

The money spent on social care for people aged 65 and over in England has been cut by 20% in the past decade, according to official figures analysed by the BBC. The drop in money allocated to councils for supporting people at home or in residential care has come as the number of older people has increased by 17%. And unlike the NHS, people have to pay towards these services. Our social affairs correspondent Alison Holt has the details. This is news that Mary Pike has been waiting for. I am happy to have a look. A social worker thinks she may have found a new care home for her 93-year-old mother. Margaretjones 93-year-old mother. Margaret jones doesn’t 93-year-old mother. Margaretjones doesn’t want to move, but she is funded by her Local Authority and the home sent a letter before Christmas saying the money the council pays doesn’t cover costs They are looking for a top up fee for the state residents to stay there, and they were looking for us to pay an extra £125 a week which we couldn’t afford. What was your first reaction when you read that letter? Well, the colour drained I have to say, she has been there six years, and it is her home. And for lady of that age now, looking to move, is obviously very unsettling. The home is oak tree court. It told the 13 council funded residents that they would have to leave, or pay the top UP would have to leave, or pay the top up fee. In Mrsjoan’s case that was in addition to the a £75 paid by Somerset Council for her nursing care, the home hasn’t commented fur. With the population getting older and social care budgets under pressure the discussions are happening in many other places. The BBC has analysed official figures on social care spending for older people in England over the last decade. Since 2003, the number of people aged 65 and over has increased by 1.4 million, of people aged 65 and over has increased by1.4 million, up 17%. But despite early rises, over ten years real terms funding for old peerms care has fallen by 6 percent. In 2003 nearly £1200 was spent for each person who has reached their 65th birthday. By last year, that had fallen tojust 65th birthday. By last year, that had fallen to just over £950. Down, nearly 20%. One of the biggest things we have to look at is the staffing. At this care home they say the fees councils are paying mean it is a struggle to meet major costs such as staffing We need more staff pershirt. We need to spend more on training and we To need to pay more. So care costs will only rise, so I don’t see that we can cut any further without damaging the reputation and the quality of care we give to people. The Care Minister says the Government has put an extra 1.1 billion into social care in the last year alone, but he acknowledges the pressures. All parties need to come together, this year, in a nonpartisan review of both NHS and care budgets, engaging the public, about how we sustain the system, how we bring the system together. As for Margaret jones she we bring the system together. As for Margaretjones she has now moved we bring the system together. As for Margaret jones she has now moved to another care home. Somerset council says it is finding new places for all those unable to pay the top up fee. So the big worry for many people is how they’re going to pay for their care when they’re old, and today the BBC has launched a guide to help work out the costs. The BBC’s care calculator uses your postcode to explain the system in detail and estimate costs in your area, in England a new £72,000 cap on care costs is being introduced in 2016. And to work out how it affects you, if you are considering residential care for example, the site will can ask you do you own your own home? What savings do you have? And what is your income? So for example, if you are a widow living in Middlesbrough, with a house worth £160,000, 30,000 worth of savings and a pension a week, the calculator estimates you may pay £137900 over five-and-a-half years £137900 over five-and-a- half years before £137900 over five-and-a-half years before the council steps in. The total exceeds the care cap of 72,00 pounds, because it includes the cost of food and lodging, which you will have to pay in a residential home. But remember, people will less money will get more help. You will find lots more information if you go to the website. And Alison is here now. Terrible stories, any indication things are going to improve any time soon? We keep seeing stories time and time again like that, is there any indication for what you found out that things are going to get better? Well, it is a sign of the pressure, it is a sign of the pressure that people are feeling at every level of the system, so the short answer is no. There is no obvious sign of that easing up in the nearfuture, the population is ageing, so that is not going to go away. While many of us will have fit and active later year, the number of people with complicated medical conditions who need support is increasing. Now, all the political parties are saying that the route out of this is better integration of health and social care. The arguments are going to lie in how they each achieve that. As we have been hearing, there are changes on the way. But they will help a small number of people or they will help some people who have very high needs. So, let us be clear about this, it is not going away quickly and it will be there as a problem for whoever forms the next Government. jordan says it’s willing to do a deal with so-called Islamic State to free a jordanian fighter pilot captured by the extremists. It has offered to free an Iraqi woman, jailed for her part in a suicide bombing, in exchange for him. IS has issued a deadline, threatening to kill the airman and a japanesejournalist, Kenji Goto, if jordan doesn’t release the woman. That deadline has now passed. Here’s our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. The hostage, jordan’s capture pilot Muath al-Kasaesbeh and a japanese film-maker Kenji Goto, both threatened with beheading by Islamic State. The pilot’s father has been pushing his Government to give in to demand for a prisoner swap. When he joined the Air Force we never knew we would bejoining other countries to fight outside thejordanian borders, tojoin the to fight outside thejordanian borders, to join the coalition borders, tojoin the coalition is not in our interest. It is not our war. Injapan, there war. In japan, there have Injapan, there have been protests there, urging the Government to do a deal. Kenji Goto’s mother has made a last minute appeal to save his life. Dear Prime Minister, please save my son’s life. Kenji only has a little time left. Islamic State wants this woman released. Sajida Rishawi. A would be suicide bomber whose belt failed to detonate ten years ago. Her accomplices murdered 60 people in Amman, forthe Her accomplices murdered 60 people in Amman, for the jordanian authorities this has been a difficult dilemma, releasing Sajida Rishawi would look like giving in to terrorism and could encourage more hostage taking. It would be a huge boost to Islamic State, which operates just across jordan’s borders with Iraq and Syria. And it could jeopardise jordan’s relations with its US allies, with whom it has been carrying out air strike, but on the other hand there is public support for rescuing the pilot and manyjordanians are unhappy about their country’s actions against Islamic State. I spoke to a kidnap expert from the company Terra firma who asked to remain anonymous, believesjordan remain anonymous, believes jordan can remain anonymous, believesjordan can afford to give up its proper If jordan were to give up, Sajida Rishawi, thenjordan would be giving UP Rishawi, thenjordan would be giving upjust that, just Rishawi, thenjordan would be giving up just that, just a suicide bomber, and there are many of those. If, however, jordan were to give up a bomb maker, in one of their prison, then I think that would be a very different question indeed. The quantum of risk of doing that, of giving up a bomb maker would be much greater. The jihadist of Islamic State have been calling the shots in this stand-off, they are fully aware of how their beheadings shocked the world. This crisis is likely to encourage them to kidnap yet more hostages. The former pop star Gary Glitter broke down in tears as he gave evidence in his trial for child abuse. Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was asked about child pornography images which were found on his computer. He denies ten charges of indecent assault against three girls between 1975 and 1980. Our correspondent Daniela Relph reports from Southwark Crown Court. Her report does contain flash photography. Arriving for a day where his evidence would be challenged and tested. Gary Glitter or Paul Gadd as he is known here, today faced questions about a past crime. In 1997 an engineerat questions about a past crime. In 1997 an engineer at this store in bliss toll found pornographic images of children on his computer while servicing it. The former pop star went on to admit downloading the image, and served a jail term. Under cross-examination byjohn Under cross-examination by john Price QC Under cross-examination byjohn Price QC he was asked directly why he was looking at pictures of men having sex with young children. He began to sob, wiping away tears as he described his life being in a bad place back then. He was given time to compose himself in the d his life being in a bad place back then. He was given time to compose himself in the dock before telling the jury ""I am so sorry, it changed my life forever. I lost my honour, I lost my family, I lost my dignity."" He went on the say he could see the damage caused by these image, it has to stop. All this internet pornography of children, it has to stop. No doubt about it. Pushed by the prosecution on why he downloaded the images Paul Gadd told the court he mayjust have been curious. He said that he had been abused as a child, and was perhaps trying to work out his own feelings. The jury has heard details of the life of Gary Glitter, the successful POP life of Gary Glitter, the successful pop star, but also been told act the drink and money problems that came later. Today he denied by a liarer, the allegations against him, he said, but also been told act the drink and money problems that came later. Today he denied by a liarer, the allegations against him, he said, were damaging, and hurtful. -- liar. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. Two Israeli soldiers and a Spanish peacekeeper have been killed in an attack on an Israeli army convoy near the Lebanese border. The militant group Hezbollah says it carried out the attack. Israel responded by firing shells into southern Lebanon. The Scottish government has announced it will suspend plans for fracking while it carries out a full public consultation. Ministers say they need to carry out new work on the environmental and health implications of the controversial gas drilling technique. The newly-elected Prime Minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, has signalled his government will stand by its anti-austerity pledges, but will not default on the country’s debts. Addressing his first cabinet meeting, Mr Tsipras said he would negotiate with creditors over the £180 billion bailout. The foreman of a jury which convicted a serial killer has told the BBC he now believes the man is innocent. Colin Norris was jailed for life in 2008 for murdering four patients and attempting to murder a fifth at two hospitals in Leeds, where he worked as a nurse. The juror has come forward after an investigation by Panorama cast doubt on the science behind the conviction. Our correspondent james Cook has this exclusive report. They called him the Angel of Death, the serial killer who stalked the wards, another Harold Shipman stopped in his tracks. But did Colin Norris, now in his seventh year behind bars, kill anyone at all? This man does not think so. Paul Moffatt was the foreman of the jury which found him guilty. If this case was presented with this new evidence today, I don’t know how it would possibly get to court in the first place. That new evidence came to light last month, in this programme. Tonight on Panorama, the story of the nurse convicted of murdering four patients. The jury found Norris guilty of injecting these frail, elderly women with lethal doses of insulin. But advances in science since the trial suggest they may actually have died of natural causes. Paul Moffatt is the second juror to tell the BBC he thinks the guilty verdict was a mistake. Is Colin Norris a murderer? In my opinion, no. Why not? Simply because of the new evidence. All I’ve seen is one side of the story, the defence side of Colin, the programme. But from that evidence, it shows that a murder wasn’t committed at all. Never mind four and one attempted murder. That’s what it shows to me. If his s conviction is quashed, how will this case be remembered? It will probably be classed as one of the biggest miscarriages ofjustice in the British justice system. I don’t think there’s ever been a case where there’s been a serial killer who’s had his conviction quashed. I don’t think that’s ever happened before. Here in his home city of Glasgow, the long wait for Colin Norris’s friends and family continues, as the Criminal Cases Review Commission considers whether or not his case merits an appeal. The commission is reviewing the new evidence, but can’t say how long its investigation will take. There are relatives of the women who died who think the verdict should be upheld. But Paul Moffett says the nurse should now be released. That’s why I came forward, put my name forward. I felt it would be my duty to do that. And the jury foreman has a message for the man behind these bars. justice, he tells Colin Norris, will come your way. Our top story this evening: Cuts to spending on social care for the over 65s - down by a fifth in England the last 10 years. And still to come, why is the ambulance service Later on BBC London. A court hears about the highly dangerous post-mortem examination on the former KGB spy who died from radiation poisoning. And next on their shopping list, could Canary Wharf be the latest purchase for the Oatari’s, the biggest overseas investor in London? technology helping to cut this Scottish castle’s electricity bill. It isa It is a story of big business and bumper profits. Apple have reported the biggest profits of any public company in history. It made £12 billion injust three months last year between October and December. Welcome to the most profitable company in the world. Whether it’s Beijing, New York or London, Apple fans have once again turned out in their millions to buy the firm’s sleek and expensive products. But what is it about Apple that means the firm is now selling 34,000 iPhones an hour? I think they are extraordinarily nice people in there, that’s one of the reasons. Very good customer service? Yes. And it is an amazing machine. It is absolutely amazing. Young people more gravitate towards Apple, because they give the latest of everything, they are always on top of their game. This is the new iPhone 6... The launch of Apple’s new phone and good Christmas trading made it a record-breaking three months. Even seasoned Apple-watchers were impressed. It’s going to be hard to top the profitability and the success of the iPhone. Apple is truly the iPhone company now. North of 70% of its profits come from the sale of the phone. So, what’s behind the Apple cash machine? Apple made a £12 billion profit in the three months to December. More than the previous record set by Exxon Mobil. Apple could see revenues as high as 160 billion this year, bigger than the national income of Portugal, at £140 billion. It would take Tesco ten years to make a profit Apple makes in three months. One of their major success stories is China, where revenues are up 70%. Middle-class consumers see Apple as a badge of success. TRANSLATION: It is now the era of Apple. Apple has conquered the world. TRANSLATION: Ijust want to play games. All the mobile phones are similar nowadays. The iPhone really attracts me because of its functions for playing games. Apple customers are almost religious in their fervour for Apple products. That is why the US firm is opening 40 more shops like this one in China alone, but there are concerns. Many people say that Apple should pay more tax around the world. iPad sales are falling and competitors are snapping at Apple’s heels. I think the financial community will start to question things like why it is not paying more tax on its $177 billion cash pile. Why it is not maybe putting more to work in greater dividends, or anything in that nature. Next for Apple comes the Watch, which will be launched in April. just in case you are wondering about the huge scale of Apple’s profits, our report started 2 minutes and 45 seconds ago. In that time, Apple has made another £250,000. A doctor on trial for carrying out female genital mutilation - or FGM - on a woman in a London hospital, has been giving evidence today in his defence. Dhanuson Dharmasena, who’s 32, denies the charge and told the jury he was acting in the best interests of the patient. Ambulance response times in Wales have hit their lowest point ever, according to new figures this morning. Last month, just over 42% of the most urgent calls received a response within eight minutes - that’s compared with 51% in November, and well below the target of 65%. Hywel Griffith reports. The emergency service that needs urgent help. Winter always puts extra pressure on paramedics. In Wales, the Ambulance Service has just had its worst month on record, failing to reach more than half of emergency calls in eight minutes. 476-year-old jenniferjones, the 476-year-old jennifer jones, the wait for the 476-year-old jenniferjones, the wait for the ambulance over two hours. Suffering from pneumonia, she became unconscious. They few hours after reaching A&E, she passed away. You have to have these questions in the back of your mind. Unless you have been affected by it, you don’t understand how serious these figures are. After years of failing to reach targets, the Welsh Ambulance Service has appointed a new chief executive. She says the growing number of 999 calls means some patients must expect long weights. We prioritise resources... Can you justify it? It does mean there is a knock-on effect for less serious calls and people will wait longer than any of us would want them to. And that’s OK? It is not OK, absolutely not OK. But if you have somebody having cardiac arrest, and a less urgent call, you have to direct your resources to the more serious call. The pressure has clearly reached breaking point in Wales, with a number of emergency calls getting a response in eight minutes falling to a record low of less than 43%. But the problems are not unique to Wales. Targets vary across the UK, but 11 out of 14 Ambulance Services are failing to make the grade. The site of ambulances queued outside A&E suggests where many of the problems lie. When hospitals are full, paramedics cannot hand over patients. They are stood outside A&E departments, often with a sick patient, for an hour or two, in some cases, and they can hear calls coming out for serious calls. In Wales, more money has been earmarked for emergency care, but with demand growing every year, there is no sign of pressure easing on the front line. Beavers will be allowed to continue living wild on a river in Devon after the government agency Natural England gave the green light to a five year trial. They’ve made their home in the River Otter, near Ottery St Mary. They’re the first to be living in the wild anywhere in England for 500 years. Claire Marshall is on the riverbank. They may look very cute, but there are real concerns about letting them continue to live there? There are real concerns. I have to say, here in the village of Ottery St Mary, they are very welcome indeed. The local school even made up a song to say they are here and they are delighted about it. They live just two kilometres downstream from where we are now. They have helped to make a little bit of history today. They have provided a template for future licenses to be applied for. What this means is that other extinct species could potentially be reintroduced. You could see licences for the lynx or even the Wolf being sought after. It is a little family, but it has created a huge impact. This is a content and free family of beavers. These pictures, shot last summer, were the first conclusive proof they were living wild on the River Otter. It is official, as long as they are free from disease, they can stay. It is a family of around nine, including at least three young. Extinct for almost half a century, this is a glimpse of what they could create. In the middle of that, there will be a chamber. This is a reserve, and the beavers have transformed what was once a little stream. This is a good thing, something that should have been done a long, long time ago. A logical and rational decision, based on facts and evidence. It is great to know they are welcoming them back today. This decision has implications, notjust for this little Devon Valley, but for the whole of England. There are people who loathe beavers and what they do. They see the habitat they create as disruptive to wildlife, particularly fish, and particularly Ainger is. -- particularly fish, and particularly Ainger is. -- dangerous. Here in the United States, growing beaver populations can cause what is being called epidemic destruction. Tell us why they should not be released into the wild in England? When you look at the way that beaver numbers can increase over time, we just cannot predict and think through what the impact on the landscape of that kind of population number will have, and the damage to fish stocks and infrastructure. A similar trial in Scotland is already underway and results are due soon. It is a mystery how this family got here. But if this five-year trial goes well, perhaps other extinct species will be brought back into the wild. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Alex Deakin. We have seen a dramatic change today. It started off pretty wet, but the problem tonight is colder air across as but the problem tonight is colder airacross as an air across as an snow falling. The Met Office has this amber warning in force. It means be prepared for problems. It’s in force across large parts of Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland. Even on low levels we could see five or ten centimetres of snow over the hills, 15 centimetres of snow as the showers continued to pile in across northern Britain through the night, blown in by a strong wind. Wintry showers further south, more of a mixture of rain, sleet and snow. We could wake up to a covering almost everywhere, as temperatures drop down too close to or below freezing. Ice is the risk across parts of Scotland. A greater problem is the snow. Not blanket coverage. These are snow showers we are dealing with. These amounts, five or ten centimetres, likely in some places. Ten miles away you could barely see a flake. Very much hit and miss. We are expecting problems through the night and through the morning, as snow showers continue. Even further south we will see some flurries of snow. The showers tend to fade through the day was off there will be some decent spells of sunshine. Even if you don’t get the snow, you will see temperatures of two or 5 degrees, add on the wind and it feels subzero. So, that wins tomorrow. They are still blowing on Friday. Not as many snow showers around, certainly at first. There could be a covering in the morning. There will still be snow showers in Scotland, blown in by a northerly wind. That is with us for the weekend. We are not done for the potential problems. A continued risk of snow and ice. If it is snowing where you are, good information on travel disruption and school closures on your local radio. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me and on Tonight on BBC London News. Flooded tunnels leave 1,000 trains cancelled in six days of chaos for commuters.

Yesterday didn’t have enough drivers, it is a different excuse every week. I’ll be late for my kids again so it is a bit of a pain. It has been challenging, to put it mildly. Last Friday, a burst water main swamped the tracks in Clerkenwell tunnel between Clerke nwell tunnel between Farringdon and Clerkenwell tunnel between Farringdon and St Pancras. The line had to be closed and only reopened on Tuesday. But today the tunnel was still not watertight, which affects the signalling. Overnight, the central section of the Thameslink line will have to be shut again. The rail operator says it is losing patience with Thames Water and a number of leaks have been fixed already. However, water continues to seep into the tunnel. There are 200,000 journeys a day on Thameslink. Closing the line means trains get separated from depots and drivers, and that means disruption. Since Friday, we’ve had 1,000 trains cancelled, we’ve had 133 hours of delays to individual trains, each of which can carry up to 750 people. The service has not been good enough. And that has been because of a burst water main and leaks. We want this sorted out, the patience of our passengers has run out, so has hours. Network Rail says it will be giving a Thames Water million pound compensation bill while it says it is trying to find the source of the water. It is impossible to predict at the moment. We are working round the clock. So passengers might be delayed tomorrow as well? They may be, yes. We are working round the clock. It is very difficult to put a timeline on this. This new rail franchise has had a poor start. Readers will be wondering when the frustration is going to end.-- wondering when the frustration is going to end. -- commuters will be wondering. Well, Nick Beake is at Farringdon now. How’s it looking? Tonight there are more cancellations and delays here, both for commuters travelling south down to Brighton, but also people trying to travel north towards Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, too. As Tom mentioned, the problem has been caused north of here between this station and St Pancras. There are delays at St Pancras this evening. It is hoped that at 9pm when they are able to shut this stretch and try to identify the problem, where the water leak has come from, that might ease the pain for commuters. At the moment, it doesn’t look like there’s an easy solution. There’s an irony because over my shoulder you’ll see some of the crossrail work that is going on here. This place is central to the future future of London’s Underground and the transport system in the capital but it seems at the moment that aching infrastructure is causing real problems. One other thing to mention, you might not use this Thameslink but for bus passengers, there are more headaches ahead. Next month, it has been confirmed there will be 321+-hour strikes. Earlier this month, there was a walk-out because Unite members from different companies say they are walking out about the disparity about pay.

The family of a man from Wembley who suffered a broken neck and brain damage following his arrest outside a club in Bedford say they are angry that the officers involved haven’t been suspended, despite being investigated by the police watchdog. 21-year-old julian Cole is now in vegetative state following the incident in May 2013. His mother says they’ve already waited 20 months for answers and are still no closer to getting justice. She’s spoken publicly for the first time to Tarah Welsh. julian Cole was happy, chatty, and had lots of friends. A sports science student at Bedfordshire University, he had hopes of being a PE teacher, something that will I’IâVâI’ i’I8ppâI’I FIOW. He was left paralysed and brain damaged after being arrested. julian smiles, but he never talks to me. He never answers me back. Hejust lies there. He isjust there. After being asked to leave this Bedford club with his friends, julian returned to ask for a refund. Police were called and reportedly pinned him down to the ground. His spinal-cord was severed. His neck broken. Two club doorman and six police officers are under criminal investigation by the IPCC. Despite investigation, the officers haven’t been suspended or put on restricted duties. Now, a commissioner of the police watchdog has questioned that three times asking Bedfordshire police to reconsider. But the Force insist that their own standards department is satisfied they can continue. No one is above the law in our country. Of course those officers shouldn’t be going to work and should be suspended until we know the results of the investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has no teeth, no spine, and should be abolished and replaced with an organisation that has the power to actually find answers and make things happen. So far, nothing has been done. And they carry on with their lives. And julian is there, in a care home. We have to take care of him. Nothing has been done for him. They are going on with their lives butjulian is there. Bedfordshire Police won’t comment while the investigation’s ongoing. The IPCC has apologised, put more staff on the case, but says it has been a complex investigation. julian’s family say they’ve already waited 20 months. They can’t change their son’s condition but they do need answers. It’s an area some people haven’t even heard of. Sandwiched between Willesden junction and Park Royal in the west of London, Old Oak Common is about to secure its place in people’s minds. The government has given the green light for it to become home to the largest regeneration scheme in the capital. Despite the promise of 24,000 homes and 55,000 jobs, there are still concerns as to just how much it will really benefit local people. Katharine Carpenter reports. Now a tangle of railway lines and industrial land, Old Oak Common has been earmarked for regeneration. This is the mayor’s fission, Canary Wharf for the rest, which does that this part of London what the Olympic Park has done for the East but at nearly 1,000 hectors straddling three boroughs, this scheme dwarfs them both and will have a rail super hub for HS2 at its heart. These plans aren’tjust about hub for HS2 at its heart. These plans aren’t just about transport links. They are promising 24,000 new homes, 55,000 newjobs to a vast swathe of West London stretching all the way up to the canal from Park Royal up to Stourbridge Park. What do they really mean for people who already live and work in the area? just around the corner on an industrial estate, this Garrard Shona is worried. There is six families making a living out of this place. And in August, when our leases terminated, they are going to be out of work. Because we aren’t going to relocate anywhere else. We are going to be on the dole. We travel to Harlesden, what do people here make about the promise of employment and housing? If it is going to give people more jobs and homes, then I am quite happy to embrace it. Ithink homes, then I am quite happy to embrace it. I think if it is going to provide more jobs, it is a good move. But it is all about delivering. It is a note of caution echoed by one local MP. The people here at the moment don’t want their environment ruined, they don’t want it to be turned into a mini Manhattan. They also want for their sons and daughters and an inadequate housing, they want to be able to afford to live in the area. Of course there will be some expensive stuff there, there will be a mix of developments. Generally speaking, that part of London, you’re in the area. Of course there will be some expensive stuff there, there will be a mix of developments. Generally speaking, that part of London, urine that sort of area, the prices of property are within most people’s reach. The Mayor’s office says a third will be social housing. We are after Park Royal where businesses are seeking reassurance they are not just an afterthought. There needs to be a lot to be sorted out in Park Royal, whether it be the borough thatisit Royal, whether it be the borough that is it or the DMC, I’m not too concerned. What we do see is that there is a central body coordinating the activity. It is clear this project will be full of challenges into the next 20 years. The public inquiry into the death of a former KGB spy has been told that his post-mortem examination was ""one of the most dangerous ever undertaken in the western world."" Alexander Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after radiation poisoning. Chris Rogers is at the Royal Courts ofjustice with more details. Well, this public inquiry into the death of the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko continues to produce compelling evidence. We’ve heard how he paid the ultimate price for his defection to London and his reported work for MI6 with at least two attempts on his life by trying to poison him with a radioactive substance. Today we heard how that led to the most dangerous postmortem known in the Western world. The Home Office pathologist explained how he and his colleagues had to wear specialist clothing to protect them and breathe nontoxic air through pipes because so much radiation was leaking from Litvinenko’s body. They found concentrations of polonium in his body, his system, his body had stopped producing white blood cells, his immune system broke down and he died of organ failure. We also discovered that at the last minute they took a blood sample that they made the discovery he had been killed by radiation poisoning. The two people accused of poisoning him remain in Russia where the government refuses to extradite them for trial in Britain. Many thanks. Pressures facing London’s A&Es over the winter have barely been out of the headlines. Most of the capital’s emergency units are struggling to hit the target of treating patients within four hours, and many are finding it hard to get enough full time staff. Tonight in the third of our series looking at the NHS frontline, Karl Mercer’s been speaking to staff at the A&E at St George’s in Tooting. Anyone who has been to one or anyone who works in one will tell you that London’s 22 A&Es are busy, and it’s no different here at St George’s in Tooting. Male priority, ETA six minutes. This unit sees around 350 patients every day, from major trauma victims, to those with more common complaints. I’m Dr Hussein, I’m one of the consultants. I’m just coming to review you and talk about your medical problems. Each week, some 80,000 Londoners will end up in A&E and when we filmed at St George’s, it was quiet. A lull, perhaps. It’s looking OK. The Fates have been kind to us this morning. A bus-load are going to arrive this afternoon, I’m sure, but we are well staffed, we are flowing everyone who is coming quite nicely so fingers crossed it should be quite fine. So, a quiet start to the day? We never says the Q word in A&E. It is a reasonable start to the day, absolutely. Hello, it’s me again. I’m going to take you to observations, all right? Blood pressure, heart rate. George’s, like other units, has recruited staff from overseas, like this man. This is going to go underneath your tongue. Thank you very much. Finding emergency doctors and nurses is a capital wide struggle, despite the attractions of the job. When it gets really, really busy, we need to prioritise a lot. So I think this is the key here sometimes. And for me, it is the best... The biggest challenge for me, to prioritise when it gets really crazy. A&Es are supposed to see and treat 95% of their patients within four hours. Here, like elsewhere in the capital, that can be difficult at times. Yesterday evening, we had a waiting room that was effectively standing room only. It was taking us anything up to two hours to get patients from the waiting room, having been triaged, making sure they’re safe, but actually getting them into cubicles to be formally seen was taking us anywhere up to two hours last night. And we were holding patients back, there were about ten patients who waiting for beds. That’s a common problem. You can only get patients in if you’re moving them out at the same speed. The rest of the hospital how they are behaving, how they are discharging, that affects us in terms of how we get backed up in the emergency department. And then what comes in through the door, so we get lots of trauma calls, lots of cardiac arrests, lots of people requiring more in depth treating and monitoring and it pulls the sources around. The Christmas rush may be over but it is still very much winter in London’s A&Es. Still to come tonight. 50 years since thousands lined the capital’s streets for Churchill’s funeral, we speak to some of the Londoners who were there. Canary Wharf is on the brink of being sold tonight to a foreign consortium, led by the biggest overseas investor in London, the Qataris. The price tag, over £2.5 billion. If the sale wins approval tomorrow, it’ll be the latest high profile purchase made by the tiny Arab Gulf state. Asad Ahmad has been looking at their growing portfolio here in the capital. Go back a few decades. This wasteland in the dock clans is now worth billions. The high-rise billions -- worth billions. The high-rise billions -- buildings of Kumari Warf have been the target for Qataris looking to buy even more of London. But why? According to the men in suits who know it’s because we have lots of different types of property here, or as they like to call it, capital. London is a transparent market. It is easy to buy assets here. There’s lots of diversity of capital and tenants in the buildings, which provides us stability, and good returns for investors. Canary Wharf is set to become anotherjewel in Qatar’s London crown. They own Harrods, the Olympic Village and The Shard. Making the most of London for sale is the Qatari Royal Family. They have Canary Wharf in their sights, and they need somewhere to stay. Seeing as Buckingham Palace isn’t up for sale any time soon, they are going to have to slum it here. They bought numbers one, two, three for £120 million. By the time they’ve done some essential home improvements, this building is going to be worth £200 million, making it London’s most expensive privately held residential property. But is this good for London, and the things Londoners stand for? Some have concerns that London shouldn’t be doing so many big deals with a tiny undemocratic Gulf state for these reasons. We have a very liberal society, they have a very conservative old-fashioned society conservative old -fashioned society which conservative old-fashioned society which operates under traditional Islamic law. They don’t treat their guest workers well. But money talks and the Qataris have lots of it which is why Canary Wharf won’t be the last thing on their London shopping list. Football, and after Chelsea’s success last night, we could see a London derby in the League Cup final at Wembley in March. It all depends on how Tottenham fare in the 2nd leg of their semi-final game tonight away to Sheffield United. Our sports reporter Chris Slegg sent this report. Tottenham had hoped to arrive here with more than a 1-0 lead from the first leg. More than 5,000 of their fans have travelled to South Yorkshire hoping to see their team book a place in the first cup final since 2009. That they have a lead at all was down to a fortuitous moment in the first leg where a needless penalty was conceded. That is all that separates them from the league one side. Under Nigel Clough they’ve knocked out five Premier league opponents from the two cup competitions injust opponents from the two cup competitions in just over a opponents from the two cup competitions injust over a year. Nigel Clough feels seeing what Bradford did against Chelsea in the FA Cup at the weekend, that also proves anything is possible. I think if anything it has alerted anybody now, Spurs and anybody playing lower league teams, don’t think it is going to be easy. That might have worked against us. This is Tottenham’s only route to Wembley, having been knocked out of the FA Cup by Leicester. They were 1-0 up, lest it equalised, and then a nightmare moment from their goalkeeper. He spilled one into the back of his neck to give Leicester the win. But Pochettino says he has plenty of faith in the Dutchman for tonight’s game. I am very happy with him. And nothing changes because in one game you concede a goal. Every player makes a mistake. It was unlucky. But our confidence is full. We have full confidence in him. So Sheffield United will no doubt look to put him under pressure. Spurs will hope to strike early and quite the 25,000 or so home fans inside a packed Bramall Lane tonight as they look to book a place in the league cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. 50 years ago this week, the eyes of the world were on London for the funeral of Sir Winston Churchill. Millions of people across the globe watched the event on TV, and thousands braved freezing conditions to line the streets of the capital. Ayshea Buksh has been to meet some of them. It seemed as if all of London had turned out onto the street. Everyone waiting to see the cortege go by. 'And, above all, her affection for her greatest son.' Churchill’s body lay in state for three days at Westminster. On the morning of the funeral, his coffin was carried along Whitehall towards the city St Paul’s Cathedral. And despite it being a cold and wintry day, thousands of people lined the streets. One of them was Barry Barnes. He came to London from Blackpool aged 17 and when he saw this footage on BBC London News, he thought he recognised a face in the crowd. It might be me. I don’t know. I would like to think it is. I was there. I was overjoyed, if that’s the right word, to get as close as I had and take a few photographs with a cheap little Insta Matic black and white camera. The filming Barry possibly features in is on permanent display at the Churchill War Rooms in Whitehall. I sat here watching his funeral once with Lady Soames, his youngest daughter, and I suddenly looked across, and I could see a tear in her eye. I realised, this isjust his daughter who’s watching this. It’s personal. And it really brought home to me how important and how... Personal it could be. And I think a lot of the nation actually felt the same way. Barry Walsh also has a personal memory. He and his friends from Westminster Boys Club in Pimlico spent all night selling newspapers along the route. We heard someone shout out that... ""He’s in the Strand!"" So, I had a few minutes before the cortege got here, and I sat down for a rest because we were very tired, quite cold, and fell fast asleep. When I woke up, all I could see going up Ludgate Hill was mounted soldiers and the tops of heads of mounted soldiers going up to St Paul’s. So, while Britain commemorates the man and his legacy, those who were on the streets of London to pay their respects to Churchill can also reflect on what they did or didn’t see. Time for a check on the weather with Thomas Schafernaker. You’ve been in a nice warm studio all day, I popped out at lunch time, it was cold with strong winds blowing. As far as the next couple of days are concerned, it will get colder and colder with some wintry showers, but get your warm coats out, fur coats out, this is what looks like on the satellite picture. We did have the cloud earlier on but the sky has brightened up and we have speckles of cloud am a little snow showers that were fleeting across the south-east. We’re not talking about much. Don’t expect a covering of snow tomorrow morning, you might get a little dusting and if anything it is going to be sleet, nothing more than that. The temperatures are pretty much what we’ve been used to over the last couple of weeks. We have had colder. Then we have a strong winds, and it is the winds that make it feel cold, and they are pushing along the wintry showers. That means sleet, snow, rain, and it looks like some of these will be hit and miss. This isjust a snapshot of these will be hit and miss. This is just a snapshot at about 4pm on Thursday. These showers of volatile and unpredictable. So the strong winds will continue, the cold winds through tomorrow evening as well, and again it looks as though we could be clipped by some of those showers coming in from the north. This is the low pressure that is going to be over us for some time. It is a cold glow which means there is a lot of cold air. And we have some weather fronts stuck in that low pressure which means we will have that cloud. Friday, not so many snow flakes, so it will be milder. After that into the weekend, it will turn once again a little bit colder. Back to you. OK, cheeky, thanks very much. The main headlines. Spending on care for people aged 65 and over has fallen by a fifth in England over the past 10 years, according to new analysis by the BBC. jordan says it’s willing to do a deal with so-called Islamic State to free a fighter pilot captured by the extremists. It’s offered to free an Iraqi jailed for her part in a suicide bombing in exchange. Tens of thousands of commuters on the Thameslink line are enduring a sixth consecutive day of disruption because of flooded tunnels at Farringdon. The station is set to close at 9 o’clock tonight. More on the day’s stories on our website. And I’ll be back later during the ten o’clock news. From all of us here, thanks for watching and have a lovely evening. Can I have a moment of your time? What I’d be looking for is some good, open, honest communication. The reason I support the Liberal Democrats is they work throughout the year, they don’t just turn up to try and get your vote at election time. I’ll vote for someone by something they’re going to do, rather than what they say. I like Nick Clegg. I think out of all of them, the top three, he seems like the most genuine. Whether you like them or not, I think if they get a job done, that’s what you need. My values are to support those that are less privileged than I am, and I don’t think that the Conservative Party stand for that. On their past record, I think Labour would ruin our economy. I think the British political system is about the finest in the world, if I’m honest. There are a few naughty boys... I think people will be undecided this time round, very much so. I want a fairer, safer society, one which I and my family and my friends can be happy in, and a country that I can be happy to be a part of, on an international level. Over the coming months, you might have campaigners coming to knock on your door. You may think you’ve heard it all before. You may not know where to turn. Or you might already have decided. But if you open your door to us, we will listen to what you have to say and make a difference. Britain needs a Liberal voice in government, one that will stop the Conservative and Labour parties when they go too far. We’d cut less than the Conservatives and borrow less than Labour. Getting the balance right, working every day to make sure we have a stronger economy and a fairer society, so that everyone, whatever your background, can have the opportunity to get on in life. This is going to be a long campaign with a lot of noise from the political parties. But when we knock on your door, we want to listen to what you have to say, so that you can decide what is right for you, yourfamily and your local community.

Hello and welcome to your Wednesday One Show with Alex jones and Matt Ba ker. Yes, the so-called ""ground war"" has started in earnest as political campaigners up and down the country knock on doors to try and convince you to vote for them. So we’ve sent two One Show reporters out to one of the most hotly contested seats in the UK to see just how hard it is. The signatures they collect during the show will determine how tonight’s programme ends. More on that in a moment. joining us tonight is a man who isn’t afraid of confrontation. And, a woman for whom a knock on the door means an arrival of a different kind. It’s award-winning documentary maker Ross Kemp and Call The Midwife’s Helen George. Have you had people at your door? I have. I’m awkward. I want to to be polite and engage with them. Ross, you have done this? I have, quite a lot over the years. I can’t say for which party. It’s interesting that the reaction that you get. Particularly when, I did it when I ",,

IS issued a deadline threatening to kill the airman along with a japanese journalist. jordan offers to free an Iraqi women jailed for her part in a suicide bombing in return for the airman - his father pleads for leniency. TRANSLATION: I ask Islamic State to treat my son in a humanitarian way as they are Muslims and he is a Muslim. We’ll be analysing the dilemma forjordan and its unprecedented public offer to the extremists.

Calls for restraint as an attack by Hezbollah leaves two Israeli soldiers dead on the border with Lebanon.

Flooded tunnels mean more problems for Thameslink passengers. And the man left in a vegetative state after being arrested. His family want the officers suspended. Good evening. jordan says it’s willing to do a deal with so-called Islamic State to free a jordanian fighter pilot captured by the extremists. IS has issued a deadline, threatening to kill the airman, Maaz al-Kassasbeh, and a japanese journalist, Kenji Goto, ifjordan doesn’t release an Iraqi woman, jailed for her part in a suicide bombing in 2005 in which 60 people were killed. That deadline has now passed. Here’s our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. The hostages - jordan’s captured pilot, Maaz al-Kassasbeh, and a japanese film-maker, Kenji Goto, both threatened with beheading by Islamic State. The pilot’s father has long been calling for a prisoner swap. He doesn’t believe his country should be fighting IS. TRANSLATION: When hejoined the air force, we never knew we would be joining other countries to fight outside thejordanian borders. The join the coalition is not in our interests, it is not our war. In japan, there have been protests there urging the government to do a deal. Kenji Goto’s mother has made a last-minute appeal to save his life. TRANSLATION: Please save my son’s life. Kenji only has a little time left. Islamic State wants this woman released. Sajida al-Rishawi’s accomplices murdered 60 people in Amman. Forthe accomplices murdered 60 people in Amman. For the authorities, this has been a difficult dilemma. Releasing Sajida al-Rishawi would look like giving in to terrorism and could encourage more hostage-taking. It would be a huge boost to Islamic State which operates just across jordan’s borders with Iraq and Syria. And it could jeopardise jordan’s relations with its US allies with whom it has been carrying out air strikes. On the other hand, there is some public support for rescuing the pilot and manyjordanians are unhappy about their country’s actions against Islamic State. I spoke to a kidnap expert who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of his work. He believesjordan can afford to give up its prisoner. If jordan was to give up Sajida al-Rishawi, jordan would be giving UP al-Rishawi, jordan would be giving upjust that, a al-Rishawi, jordan would be giving up just that, a suicide upjust that, a suicide bomber. If, however, jordan were to give up a bomb maker in one of their prisons, that would be a very different question indeed. They are starting to lose hope that he will ever come back alive. Frank Gardner, BBC News. Our correspondent, Yolande Knell, is in the jordanian capital Amman for us tonight. It’s under pressure from the US and also from its own people? That’s right. It is a very sensitive moment injordan. There are a couple of big demonstrations by relatives of Lieutenant Maaz al-Kassasbeh, some of them outside the Royal Palace, thatis of them outside the Royal Palace, that is where King Abdullah met the wife and the father of this 26-year-old pilot. He tried to give them assurances that the government is doing all it can to secure his release. We have seen so many rumours circulating, that it’s been very frustrating for the family. They are found themselves in despair one minute, then picked up by hope the next. So, ultimately, all that’s happening here is going to play out to have a big role in shaping domestic, political opinion, but also, of course, strategically forjordan and how it deals with Islamic State militants and how it determines its future in the US-led coalition. Thank you. The money spent on social care for each person aged 65 and over in England has been cut by 20% in the past decade, according to official figures analysed by the BBC. The drop in money that councils spend on supporting people at home or in residential care reflects a 17% increase in the number of older people. And unlike the NHS, people have to pay towards these services. Our social affairs correspondent, Alison Holt, has the details. Is there a couple of numbers then for me to ring... This is news that Mary Pike has been waiting for. I’m happy to go and have a look. A social worker thinks she may have found a new care home for Mary’s 93-year-old mother. Another one of her there. Margaret jones doesn’t want to move but she’s funded by her local authority and the home sent a letter before Christmas saying the money the council pays doesn’t cover costs. They’re looking for a top-up fee for the state residents to stay there and they’re looking for us to pay an extra ÂI25 per week, which obviously we couldn’t afford. What was your reaction when you read that letter? Well, the colour drained, I have to say. She’s been there six years. And it’s her home. And for a lady of that age now, looking to move, it’s very unsettling. The home is Oak Tree Court in Wellington. It told the 13 council-funded residents that they’d have to leave or pay the top-up fee. In Mrsjones’ case, that was in addition to the £575 a week paid by Somerset Council for her nursing care. The home hasn’t commented further. With the population getting older and social care budgets under pressure, the sort of hard, financial discussions taking place here in Somerset are happening in many other places. The BBC has analysed official figures on social care spending for older people in England over the last decade. Since 2003, the number of people aged 65 and over has increased by1.lI million, up 17%. But despite early rises, over ten years, real terms funding for older people’s care has fallen by 6%. In 2003, nearly £1,200 was spent for each person who’d reached their 65th birthday. By last year, that had fallen to just over £950, down nearly 20%. One of the biggest things we’ve to look at is the staffing... At this care home in Yorkshire they see the fees councils are paying mean it’s a struggle to meet major costs such as staffing. If we want higher standards, we need more staff per shift, we need to be spending more on training, and we need to pay staff more, so care costs are only going to rise. So I don’t see, as a care provider, that we can cut any further without damaging the reputation and the quality of care we give to people. The Care Minister says the Government has put an extra £1.1 billion into social care in the last year alone. But he acknowledges the pressures. All parties need to come together this year in a non-partisan review of both NHS and care budgets, engaging the public about how we sustain the system, how we bring the system together. As for Margaret jones, she’s now moved to another care home. Somerset Council says it is finding new places for all those unable to pay the top-up fee at Oak Tree Court. Alison Holt, BBC News. Well, today, the BBC has launched a online guide to help work out the costs of care. In England, it also calculates how people will be affected by the introduction of a £72,000 cap on care costs in 2016. For more information go to bbc.co.uk/care. It’s a story of big business, bumper sales and giant profits. Apple - makers of the iPhone and iPad - have reported the largest profits of any public company in history. It made an eye-popping £12 billion in just three months last year - between October and December. But today’s mega-profits have once again raised a difficult issue - should the company be paying more tax? Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, has the story. Welcome to the most profitable company in the world. Whether it’s Beijing, New York, or London, Apple fans have once again turned out in their millions to buy the firm’s sleek and expensive products. But what is it about Apple that means the firm is now selling 34,000 iPhones an hour? I think they’re extraordinarily nice people in there, that’s one of the reasons. They’re very good at customer service? Yes, and it is an amazing machine, it is absolutely amazing. Young people are more gravitated towards Apple because they give the latest of everything and they are always on top of their game. This is the new iPhone 6... The launch of Apple’s new phone and good Christmas trading made it a record-breaking three months. Even seasoned Apple watchers were impressed. It’s going to be hard to top the profitability and the success of the iPhone. Apple is truly the iPhone company now. 75% of its profits come from the sale of the phone. just how big is the Apple cash machine? Apple made a £12 billion profit in the three months to December, more than the previous record set by Exxon Mobil. Apple could see revenues as high as £160 billion this year, that’s bigger than the national income of Portugal at £1lIo billion. It would take Tesco ten years to make the profit Apple makes in three months. One of their major success stories is China, where revenues are up 70%. Middle-class consumers see Apple as a badge of success. Apple customers are almost religious in their fervour for Apple products. That’s why the US firm is opening Ao more shops like this one in China alone. But there are concerns. Many people say that Apple should pay more tax around the world. iPad sales are falling and competitors are snapping at Apple heals. Pressure on technology firms and their tax arrangements is coming from the very top. Mr Speaker, let’s close loopholes, so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in America. Apple insists it follows all the rules and points out it’s one of America’s biggest taxpayers. But investors still say there are questions to answer. I think the financial community will start to question things like why it’s not paying more tax on its $177 billion cash pile. Why it’s not maybe putting more to work in greater dividends, or anything of that nature. Next for Apple comes the watch, which will be launched in April. just in case you were wondering about the huge scale of Apple’s profit - my report started 2 minutes and A5 seconds ago. In that time, Apple has made another £250,000. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. The new government in Greece has given the clearest signal yet it will press ahead with the anti-austerity policies that swept it to power at the weekend. It’s called a halt to the privatisation programme demanded by the EU and IMF as part of the multibillion pound bailout, though it has pledged not to default on the country’s debt. Our economics editor, Robert Peston, is with me. Robert, there have been further heavy falls on Greece’s financial markets today? How serious is it looking? Pretty serious. They don’t want to default, want to stay in the euro. Those who lend to Greece, investors, aren’t sure it can honour those apparent commitments. Therefore, billions and billions of euros are being withdrawn from Greek banks because if Greece were to go for a new currency, that would collapse in value. Anybody who has money over there would lose a fortune. Now, when money is withdrawn the central bank has to step in and provide emergency support. That con strains what banks can do. They can’t lend as much. Therefore, this very fragile recovery, which has started in Greece, may well be snuffed out. It’s all looking extremely messy. The governor of the Bank of England has had something to say about it He has. He hasn’t weighed into the Greek crisis. He is concerned about the flatlining of the Eurozone economy. What he has really done, which is remarkable. He said that austerity in the Eurozone has gone too far. He wants to see more borrowing by Eurozone countries, more spending. It’s an implicit criticism of Germany. For the longer term he wants new mechanisms put in place so the likes of the German economy, very strong, can bail out weaker economies. Why is he weighing in to what many people would say is not his business, we are not in the Eurozone? The problem is that what happens in the Eurozone, its mess, does affect us. It is our major trading partner. It’s probably the big risk to global prosperity right now. He feels he has a mandate I imagine the Germans will be wishing he will hop off. Robert. Thanks very much. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. The former pop star, Gary Glitter, has broken down in tears while giving evidence at his trial in London for alleged sex offences. Glitter- whose real name is Paul Gadd - was being asked about images of child abuse which were found on his computer. He denies 10 charges of indecent assault, against three girls, between 1975 and 1980. A public inquiry into the death of the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, has heard that his body was so radioactive that the post-mortem examination was ""one of the most dangerous ever undertaken."" Mr Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium in London just over eight years ago. A doctor accused of carrying out female genital mutilation, or FGM, on a woman in a London hospital, has been giving evidence today in his defence. Dhanuson Dharmasena said that he regarded the practice as ""abhorrent"" and saw ""no medical justification"" for it. He denies the charge. The foreman of a jury which convicted a serial killer has told the BBC he now believes the man is innocent. Colin Norris was jailed for life in 2008 for murdering four patients and attempting to murder a fifth at two hospitals in Leeds where he worked as a nurse. The juror has come forward after an investigation by BBC Panorama cast doubt on the science behind the conviction. Our correspondent, james Cook, has this exclusive report. They called him the Angel of Death, the serial killer who stalked the wards, another Harold Shipman stopped in his tracks. But did Colin Norris, now in his seventh year behind bars, kill anyone at all? This man doesn’t think so. Paul Moffitt was the foreman of the jury which found Norris guilty. If this case was presented with this new evidence today, I don’t even know how it could possibly get to court in the first place. That new evidence came to light last month in this programme. 'Tonight on Panorama, the story of the nurse convicted of murdering four patients...' The jury found Norris guilty of injecting these frail, elderly women with lethal doses of insulin. But advances in science since the trial suggest they may actually have died of natural causes. Paul Moffitt is the second juror to tell the BBC he thinks the guilty verdict was a mistake. Is Colin Norris a murderer? In my opinion, no. Why not? Simply because of the new evidence. I mean, all I’ve really seen is one side of the story, like the defence side of Colin, the programme, but from that, the evidence shows that a murder wasn’t committed at all, never mind four, or one attempted murder. That’s what it shows to me. If Colin’s conviction is quashed, how will this case be remembered? miscarriages ofjustice in the British justice system. Here in his home city of Glasgow, the long wait for Colin Norris’s friends and family continues as the Criminal Cases Review Commission considers whether or not his case merits an appeal. The Commission is reviewing the new evidence, but can’t say how long its investigation will take. There are relatives of the women who died who think the verdict should be upheld, but Paul Moffitt says the nurse should now be released. Like I say, that’s why I came forward, put my name forward, Ijust felt it would be my duty to do that. And the jury foreman has a message for the man behind these bars. justice, he tells Colin Norris, will come your way. james Cook, BBC News, Glasgow. Two Israeli soldiers have been killed in an attack on an army convoy near the Lebanese border. The militant group Hezbollah says it carried out the attack. Israel responded by firing shells into southern Lebanon. A Spanish peacekeeper died in the exchange of fire. The UN has called for ""maximum restraint to prevent an escalation."" Our Middle East correspondent, Orla Guerin, is in Beirut. How likely is this to escalate further? There is a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety about what would follow. These two sides, Israel and Hezbollah, went to war in 2006. There is a lot of concern internationally about anything that would bring about a reputation of all of that. An airstrike took place inside Syria earlier this month. It killed six Hezbollahs, a senior figure and an Iranian General. Hezbollah would retaliate. It blamed Israel. It struck back today. The question is, will it feel it has evened the score enough? The other big unknown is what will the full-scale of Israel’s retaliation be? The Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been making characteristically tough statements. He has been meeting senior security officials tonight. He is facing an election in March. If his troops get bogged down here in any kind of prolonged engagement that could be costly at the polls. Hezbollah, for its part, is very committed, fighting in Syria on behalf of the Assad regime. There may not an interest for either side to escalate. It’s a volatile region, a combustible mix. The danger exists that an escalation could happen even if neither side really intends that. Orla Guerin, thank you. It’s the mysterious death that has gripped Argentina and led to a crisis for its government. State Prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead in his apartment last week, just hours before he had been due to testify against President Cristina Kirchner and other senior government officials. Mr Nisman had been investigating Argentina’s worst terrorist attack - a bombing at a jewish centre in 1994 - which killed 85 people. He had accused the government of a cover up. Tonight, on the eve of Alberto Nisman’s funeral, his family and supporters are gathering for a wake. Wyre Davies reports from Buenos Aires. Alberto Nisman knew that his life might be in danger, but said he was looking forward to testifying in Congress on his damning report into one of the worst crimes in Argentine history. Hours before he was due to take the stand, Nisman was found dead in his Buenos Aires flat. 85 people died when the jewish cultural centre, or AMIA, was destroyed by a huge car bomb in 1994. Suspicion long focussed on Iranian involvement, but Nisman went further, accusing senior Argentine officials of seeking to absolve Iran of any blame in exchange for lucrative trade agreements. President Kirchner went on the offensive, rejecting Nisman’s conclusions. She said it was part of a plot to undermine the government by Argentina’s powerful internal security service, which she vowed to dismantle. Still seeking justice for those killed in the ‘94 attack, Argentina’s jewish leaders accused the President of self interest, showing little concern for the dead prosecutor or his investigation. TRANSLATION: This was the first of many such global terrorist attacks, followed by 9/11, London and the recent case in France. So if there’s no justice in this case, there’ll be impunity to continue. At the luxury apartment where Alberto Nisman’s body was found, police investigations are continuing. A Congressional committee looking into Nisman’s report denounced the failure of government officials to appear before them since his death. Many questions remain unanswered. Why was his security team absent and was the prosecutor suicidal, like the government initially claimed? He was not depressed. He was convinced of what he was doing. And, he said to me, that if he have in his hands all this proof, he had to present it. leading him a gunn. He only did so because he said Nisman could no longer trust his bodyguards. This is a country where many people have lost faith in their government and many institutions.

Goodbye. Tonight on BBC London News: A thousand trains cancelled since Friday. Flooded tunnels mean a sixth day of problems for Thameslink passengers. We are all paying our rail fares. We are all paying our railfares. I need to get home. The man left in a vegetative state after police arrested him. His family want the officers suspended.

Your local and national weather’s coming up. Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. Thameslink says its rail services will be disrupted until at least tomorrow night- because of a flooded tunnel at Farringdon. The line brings people into the City from Bedford to the north and from Brighton and Sevenoaks to the south. Today was the sixth day in a row of delays - caused by burst water pipes. Around a thousand trains have been cancelled since Friday and part of the route is shut for emergency repair works. As our Transport Correspondent Tom Edwards reports, Thames Water now faces a multi-million pound compensation claim. Day six and more delays and cancellations for Thameslink passengers. Those that use the line have had a dreadful time recently. And tonight has been no different. It is not suitable, the trains aren’t suitable. Every week it’s a different excuse. On Monday, they don’t know it was the pipe. Yesterday, they didn’t have enough drivers. There were faults on trains last week. It’s a different excuse every week. Late for my kids again. It’s a bit of a pain at the moment. It’s been challenging, to put it mildly. Last Friday, a burst water main swamped the tracks in Clerkenwell Tunnel between Farringdon and St Pancras Stations. The line had to be closed and only re-opened on Tuesday, but today the tunnel was still not watertight, which affects the signalling. Overnight the central section will have to be shut again. The rail operator says it is losing patience with Thames Water and a number of leaks have been fixed already. However, water continues to seep into the tunnel. There are 200,000 journeys a day on Thameslink. Closing the line means trains get separated from depots and drivers and that means disruption. Since Friday, we’ve had a thousand trains cancelled, we’ve had 133 hours of delays to individual trains, each of which can carry up to 750 people. The service is just not good enough. And that’s been because of a burst water main and then four further lea ks, we believe. We want this sorted out. The patience of our passengers has run out. So has ours. Network Rail says it will be giving Thames Water a £1 million compensation bill while it says it is trying to find the source of the water. It is impossible to predict at the moment. As I said, we are working around-the-clock. Passengers might be delayed tomorrow as well? They may be, yes. As I say, we are working around-the-clock. It’s very difficult to put a timeline on this at the moment. This new rail franchise has had a poor start. Commuters will be wondering when the frustration is going to end. Tom Edwards, BBC London News, Farringdon. Nick Beake’s at Farringdon now. What’s Thameslink saying about when this will be fixed? Well, they are saying it is very much in the hands of Thames Water. I don’t think a huge amount of people would have been filled with confidence tonight after the water company said it was unable to put a timeline on when this problem would be fixed. just to recap where we are: The stretch of the line from here to St Pancras will be closed all of tomorrow as they try and work out where this water is coming from. There will be a revised timetable on the rest of the Thameslink service. The best bet is to go online and see how that will affect your journey. They are working overnight to fix this. But we are not getting positive vibes that it will be fixed any time soon. We have also learnt tonight that five trains have been damaged because of water and the operating company is saying that when they are in a position to run a full service again, there will be cancellations and shorter trains. Away from the trains, not great news for people who use the bus? That’s right. There will be three more 24-hour bus strikes. They will be next month on the 5th, 13th and the 16th of February. Of course, earlier this month, there was a bus strike and there was widespread disruption across the capital. Some drivers are angry that there is a disparity when it comes to pay. Drivers from different companies across the capital get different salaries. They want there to be a uniform pay and conditions deal done across the capital. TfL said that is simply unworkable. It would cost £100 million to implement and they have criticised that decision to take industrial action. Thank you. The family of a 21-year-old from Wembley who was left in vegetative state after being arrested say they’re angry the officers involved haven’t been suspended. julian Cole suffered a broken neck and brain damage following the incident in May 2013. His mother has spoken publicly for the first time about the case to Tarah Welsh. julian Cole was happy, chatty and had lots of friends. A sports science student at Bedfordshire University, he had hopes of being a PE teacher. Something that will never happen now. He was left paralysed and brain damaged after being arrested and his family still have no answers about what happened. He only smiles but he never talk to me, he never answered me back. He’sjust laid in there. It is just hell. After being asked to leave this Bedford club with his friends, julian returned to ask for a refund. Police were called and reportedly pinned him down to the ground. His spinal cord was severed, his neck broken. Two club doormen and six police officers are under criminal investigation by the IPCC. Despite the investigation, the officers haven’t been suspended or put on restricted duties. Now, a commissioner at the police watchdog has questioned that three times asking Bedfordshire Police to reconsider. But the force insists that their own standards department is satisfied that they can continue. No-one is above the law in our country. Of course, those officers should not be going to work and should be suspended until we know the results of their investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has no teeth, no spine, and should be abolished and replaced with an organisation that has the power to actually find answers and make things happen. So far, nothing has been done. And they carry on with their lives and julian is there in a care home, we have to take care of home, nothing has been done for him. They are going on with their lives, butjulian is there. Bedfordshire Police won’t comment while the investigation’s ongoing. The IPCC has apologised for the amount of time it’s taken and says it’s put more staff on the case, but says the investigation has been complex. julian’s family say they’ve already waited 20 months. They can’t change their son’s condition, but they do need answers. Tarah Welsh, BBC London News.

Most of the capital’s emergency units are struggling to hit the target of treating patients within four hours - and many are finding it hard to get enough full time staff. Tonight, the third in our series looking at the NHS frontline. Our correspondent, Karl Mercer, hears from staff at the A&E at St George’s in Tooting. Anyone who has been to one, or anyone who works in one will tell you that London’s 22 A&Es are busy, and it is no difference here at St George’s in Tooting. This unit sees 350 patients every day, from major trauma victims, to those with common complaints. I’m going to review you... Each week, some 80,000 Londoners will end up in A&E. When we filmed at St George’s it was quiet, a lull perhaps. It’s looking OK. The fates have been kind to us. The bus-load will arrive this afternoon I’m sure. We are well staffed. Everyone is flowing through quite nicely. We should be fine. A quiet start to the day? We never say the Q word in A&E! Hello, Peggy, it is me again, yeah? George’s has recruited staff from overseas, like this man. This is going to go underneath your tongue. Perfect. Thank you. Finding emergency doctors and nurses is a capital-wide struggle despite the attractions of the job. When it gets busy, they need to prioritise a lot, so I think this is the key here sometimes. And it is the best- the biggest challenge for me is to prioritise when we get crazy. A&Es are supposed to see and treat 95% of their patients within four hours. Here, like elsewhere in the capital, that can be difficult at times. Yesterday evening, we had a waiting room that was standing room only. It was taking us anything up to two hours to get patients from the waiting room, having been triaged - and we make sure they are safe - to get them into cubicles to be seen was taking us up to two hours and we were holding patients, ten patients in the department who were waiting for beds. That is a common problem. You can only get more patients in if you are moving them out at the same speed. The rest of the hospital, how they are behaving, their discharges, that affects us a lot in terms of how we get backed up in the emergency department, and what comes in through the door, so if we get lots of trauma calls, lots of cardiac arrests, lots of people who require more in-depth treating and monitoring, it pulls resources around. The Christmas rush may be over, but it’s still very much winter in London’s A&Es. Karl Mercer, BBC London News. And continuing our series on the Frontline NHS, tomorrow we look at how the elderly are cared for in the capital. It’s time for me to wish you a very good night. And hand you over to Philip Avery for the weather. You gave the game away. Riz is wondering about her footwear for tomorrow. I’ve gone for the warmth myself. A dull start today. It brightened up very nicely. You will see further north the wintry mix is already there. Closer to home, if anything falls from the skies, there could be a wintry nature about it. Simply because those temperatures are going to dip away. We will be down at 1 or 2. Perhaps you thought it might be a bit lower. The saving grace is the strength of the wind. Once you step out in it tomorrow, it will be right through you like a knife! There is the possibility later in the day that the showers will turn more wintry. Especially over the high ground. Then we are off and running into the start of Friday. Friday, I think, they will be more watery than wintry. Alex will be along in a moment with more about the wintry weather. I have to tell you, it is going to stay cold. The wind will flick around towards the north and that will make it chilly for all. A dramatic change in our weather over the past 24 hours.

It is not everywhere. This is snow showers we are dealing with. Somewhat hit-and-miss. We will see these amounts in some places. Five miles away, you may not see much more than a few flakes. Snow is a problem. Ice is a hazard as well. There could be some snow on the Moors. It should brighten up here. There will be sunny spells through the day. There will still be a bitter wind and plenty more of the snow showers. By the afternoon, the snow is confined to the hills and mountains. There will be some sun, but it will feel cold. Add on the wind, it will feel sub-zero. That cold wind continues to blow tomorrow evening and continues to bring the risk of some sleet and snow.

The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has stepped up his attack on Labour over the economy - saying victory for the opposition at the General Election in May could plunge the country into "" real poverty."" Speaking to the BBC, he insisted the NHS was safe in Conservative hands, after claims from Labour that the health service couldn’t survive five more years under the Tories. This report from Matt Cole. The battle lines are being drawn and the fight to control the election campaign agenda has begun. Labour is determined to talk about health, the Conservatives the economy. The Prime Minister this morning insisted cuts planned by his party for after the next election were not ideological, but said £12 billion must be trimmed from the welfare budget if big across departmental savings were to be avoided. Mr Cameron also had this warning for boaters. As I see it, we have four months in this year to save Britain’s economic recovery, it is all at risk from a group of politicians who have learned nothing from the last five years and who will borrow, spend and tax all over again, putting us back to square one. In 1992, focus on the economy one day perjohn Major and Cameron is trying to repeat the trick, claiming Labour would spend an extra 13 billion paying interest on the national debt by 2020. The Prime Minister said a number of things about dead today and what you see are desperate claims from a desperate Prime Minister-- about debt. For him to start talking about labour, if we get in, increasing people’s taxes when he has done that 20 times in the course of this Parliament. The Tories are not the only party going back to the future to win this election. Like Tony Blair in 1997, Labour to win this election. Like Tony Blair in1997, Labourwants Blair in 1997, Labour wants to weaponised the NHS to win the election, with acclaimed the Health Service would be unrecognisable if David Cameron wins in May. It says under the Tories, nearly half of the key NHS targets in England have been missed, there is a staffing crisis and it is harder to see a GP. On health, Ukip has today hinted it would cut NHS middle managers is elected and the Liberal Democrats have proved, they say, they can protect public services. MPs return to the Commons tomorrow to begin the last leg of this Parliament but it is clear all mines will now be focused on the divisive issues that could win them a seat back here in May. Matt Cole, BBC News. The search has resumed for the crew of a cargo ship found overturned off Caithness. Helicopters, lifeboats and shoreline rescue teams are looking for eight people who were on board the Cypriot-registered Cemfjord. Its upturned hull was spotted by the crew of a ferry in the Pentland Firth yesterday. This report from Kevin Keane. The first possible clue to what went wrong, a small zodiac boat washed up onto the shore this morning on the island of South Ronaldsay. It is not clear if this is from the Cemfjord, but coastguard teams are down focusing on this area of Orkney in their search for more wreckage. We are looking to cover any possibility is that if anything has fallen off his vessel, these are the likely areas, whether it is a dingy, whether it is a person who is likely to have made it to the land, this is the nearest point of land to the last known position of the vessel. The capsized freight carrier is still where it was first discovered almost 24 hours ago. The ship’s last known location on Friday was ten miles east of weather bow of the ship now sits above the water line. It is a large area to cover and the Pentland Firth is notorious for its hostility. The swell from the see clearly shows the difficulties these rescuers still face. The Aberdeen ferry which found her had already been delayed by bad weather. There was a sombre mood among passengers who had disembarked. We actually saw it, yes. She saw it first and she said, look, as ship, Andrew and I turned and said, I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe it, there was a shift. The water at the time, you could tell it was cold, it was a rough sea, you could tell the people who were on board were possibly going to be in severe trouble. Every available crewmember was outside on the neck searching for broke, but I don’t think they could find anyone. On this second day of the operation, the intensity of the surge has increased further, but coastguard say hope of finding any survivors continues to fade -- search.

The Hoegh Osaka had just left the port, bound for Germany, when it hit a sandbar known as Bramblebank near the Isle of Wight. Robert Hall is there. Clearly, it is still in a critical position on that sandbank? Yes, that is right, something like a 45 degrees list and what the salvage teams don’t know is whether that cargo has shifted and if it has, and there could be several hundred, if not a thousand cars on there, and the weight is helping to keep the ship on that bank, it is a real problem. The other thing you see from here is the size of the vessel and the hazards facing the rescue teams last night. We have some pictures taken by the RNLI during the operation to get those 25 crew members of macro. -- the operation to get those 25 crew members of macro. -- off. Luckily, the weather was calm last night but because of the size of the vessel and the drop to the water, they had to be careful to make sure no one was hurt but fortunately, everyone was of safe and sound. Now the headache starts, how do you move this massive vessel off sandbank and the other question is how did it come to be there in the first place? It’s course out of Southampton should have taken it around the end of the bank away to my left and then turning left again to the Open sea but somehow, after it made that term, it veered off course, and that is something we may have answered when there is a press conference later today. As far as salvage is concerned, we weight, high tide has come and gone with no appreciable difference so it may be a few days before they can move it. Robert Hall, thank you.

Prince Andrew is due to return to the UK today - embroiled in allegations that he had previously had sex with an underage girl. Last night, Buckingham Palace issued a second statement strenuously denying the allegations. Our royal correspondent Peter Hunt is with me now. And so Prince Andrew is returning to a media whirlwind? Yes, Ithink And so Prince Andrew is returning to a media whirlwind? Yes, I think his holiday may not have been a relaxing one, free of distractions. He took the decision on the ski slopes yesterday for Buckingham Palace to release this unprecedented second statement that the allegations are without foundation. It is unprecedented because the default position is usually to say no comment. He is heading back to the UK, still on holiday and not seen in public for some while, but his mother, the Queen, was seen this morning. She is in Sandringham on holiday and was seen going to church. Mother and son are likely to talk in the coming days, likely in person or on the phone. Officials working for Prince Andrew are keen to stress he is not in hiding, he is innocent and it will be business as usual, but Prince Andrew faces a number of challenges. There is the risk of potential of further drip drip allegations emerging in the states and this once again puts focus on thejudgement states and this once again puts focus on the judgement of Prince Andrew and his friends, his links with the convicted jeffrey Epstein, showing he was guilty of a very poor choice of friend. Peter, thank you. That is porno, you can see all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel-- that is all for now. Buckle up and hold onto your seats. Over the next three minutes or so, I am going to take you on a weather roller-coaster ride, although you may not know it but at the start of the week, things start on a positively benign, quiet note. Not much sunshine across the south-west, it is firmly mild, but come further north through the Thames Valley, part and West of England, some of the fog is lingering and it is stubborn and where it hangs around, temperatures struggled to get much above freezing. Northern Ireland, the fog has been replaced by cloud, cloudy for western Scotland and eastern Scotland holding onto some brightness butjust Scotland holding onto some brightness but just 2 degrees Scotland holding onto some brightness butjust 2 degrees in Aberdeen. For eastern Scotland and eastern England tonight, initially a touch of frost, but that won’t last very long. Mild air starts to wafting from the south-west and with it, a blanket cloud with his back the Mr Underhill fog -- it, a blanket cloud with his back the Mr Underhill fog -- with hill fog, but a much milder weather. We start the new week with high pressure over the near confident and weather fronts to the West. In between, this squeeze in the isobars a south-westerly wind, and mild wind, which tends to pump up in the country through the day and a of cloud and hill fog, particularly in the West. The best chance of any brightness, east of the Pennines and East of Scotland but double figures for many others. Monday night and into Tuesday, we keep a south-westerly wind, it stays mild and cloudy and damp but out West, this weather front moves into the picture. A cold front will bring heavy rain across Northern Ireland and western Scotland and for a time, cold enough to bring some snow over northern Scotland. Cooler and fresher behind it but again, for most, Tuesday is fairly mild, cloudy and damp, ten or 11 degrees across parts of the South. So fairly benign and gentle to start the week, relatively mild, but I promised you a roller-coaster and it starts midweek, becoming increasingly wet and windy and it all starts because of this area of low pressure way up to the north-west. This weather front sliding towards us, notice the tightly squeezed isobars, the winds are increasing as well. Initially acquired and mild start in eastern areas but the rain will spread its way in in western parts, particularly strong and gusty over the Pennines and the Scottish mountains, bear it in mind if you are travelling anywhere during Wednesday. Wednesday night into Thursday brings this weather front erratically southwards and eastwards, taking the rain with it. Behind it temporarily opens the floodgates to some colder air, spreading in through Thursday and cold enough for showers in north-western areas, particularly western Scotland, to be wintry even to fairly low levels. Elsewhere, it can take awhile to lose the rain from the south-east but then a bright day, fairly cool and fresh the most of us. But then trouble is brewing again in the Atlantic in the form of low pressure. As we move towards Friday, it is likely to be developing, making it a forecasting headache in terms of where it will go but it could very close to the far north of Scotland with extremely is strong winds, storm force winds, some outbreaks of rain heavily in the West and I’ll feel to the weather.

The opposition calls his comments ""desperate"" and says the NHS in England will be ""unrecognisable"" if the Conservatives return to power in May. We’ll be examining how the campaign will develop over the next four months. Also tonight: Hopes fade for the eight sailors missing after their cargo ship capsized and sank off the coast of Caithness. In the sort of weather conditions they would have been in, they would have been battened down with all the doors shut. If they had capsized quickly they would have had no chance to get out. The BBC understands the convicted rapist, Ched Evans, is in talks to join Oldham Athletic. And it’s emerged that the car transporter beached on a sandbank near the Isle of Wight was run aground deliberately. Good evening. The main political parties have begun the New Year drawing the battle lines ahead of the general election in May, with the NHS and the economy centre stage. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said today that Britain had four months to save the economic recovery. Labour put the focus on the health service saying it couldn’t survive five more years under the Tories. Our Political Correspondent, Chris Mason, reports. MPs are back here at Westminster tomorrow, but the election campaign is already underway. Labour is determined to talk about the health service. The Conservatives - the economy. In a BBC interviewed this morning, the Prime Minister’s central message was clear- a strong economy is vital and only the Tories can deliver one. As I see it, we have four months in this year to save Britain’s economic recovery. It is all at risk from a group of politicians who have learnt nothing from the last five years who will borrow, spend and tax all over again, putting us right back to square one. If that kind of stuff rings a bell, remember this? It was 1992 and the Conservatives focusing on the economy. just look at their adverts. David Cameron is heading down the same road now, claiming Labour would spend an extra £13.5 billion on paying interest on the national debt by 2020. Rubbish, says Labour. The Prime Minister said a number of things about tax, a number of things about debt today. What you see here are desperate claims from a desperate Prime Minister. For him to start talking about Labour, if we get in, increasing peoples’ taxes, when he has increased taxes more than 20 times in the course of this Parliament. The Tories aren’t the only party going back to the future to fight the election. 24 hours to save our National Health Service... Like Tony Blair in 1997, expect plenty from Labour on the NHS. It says under the Conservatives nearly half the key NHS targets in England have been missed. Claims there is a staffing crisis and says it is harder to book a doctor’s appointment. Ukip says the NHS is likely to need more money but has too many middle managers and the Liberal Democrats say they have proved they can protect public services. So, here we go then. The debates, the rows, the adverts, the arguments. And they are onlyjust beginning. And Chrisjoins me now. Only a few days into the New Year and already the campaigning is under way. It is the shape, I think it is the tone and volume of the campaign. No one will predict the outcome of this election. It is that close. Even those who are veterans of those watching political campaigns. When you ask them who will win, they scrunched up their face and had you ask them who will win, they scrunched up theirface and had met they actually don’t have a clue. Not only is the battle between Labour and Conservatives looking close. You have the Scottish National Party looking confident, the same with the Green party. The Labour leader will be in Salford tomorrow for his big set piece speech of the year. He said it is a once in a generation fighter. Whilst Labour sources say they could be outspent by the Conservatives, they think they can outnumber the Tories in the key seats by a similar amount. The Tories will send out Cabinet big hitters tomorrow in a press conference. They will say there has been some official Treasury number crunching that suggest Labour will have to borrow more money than they currently say would be necessary. Labour say it is not the case. Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems will say, voted Lib Dem, get a coalition. You will be excused for thinking this election was this Thursday, not 17 weeks on Thursday. The reason Westminster is counting down, they know power is slipping away from the politicians. The search for the missing crew of a cargo ship found capsized off Caithness has been suspended after no sign was found of the eight people who were on board. The Cypriot-registered vessel was spotted yesterday by the crew of a ferry in the Pentlands Firth - but has now sunk. Craig Anderson reports. Two rescue helicopters resumed the search for survivors at the wreck at first light this morning. Five local lifeboats were also involved in the mission, but they were stood down this afternoon. The grim assumption is the boat went down so quickly, none of the eight-man crew had time to escape. The sort of conditions they would have been in, they would have been battened down with all the doors shut. If they capsized quickly, they would have had no chance to get out. A small Zodiac inflatable boat that washed ashore on Orkney could have come from the vessel. So shoreline search teams have been concentrating their efforts in this area. We are just looking to cover possibilities that if anyone has made it off this vessel these are the likely areas whether it is a the likely areas where, whether it isa dinghy or whether it is a person, is likely to have made it to the land. Late this afternoon it was confirmed with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency that she had disappeared beneath the waves of the Pentland Firth. Rescue teams had reached the ship in treacherous seas late yesterday, but could find no sign of life. Passengers from the ferry which first spotted the stricken vessel was shocked at what they’d discovered. I couldn’t believe it. There was the ship. The water at the time, you could tell it was cold, it was a rough sea. Every available crewmember was outside searching for folk. With all realistic hopes now gone that anyone would be found alive, the search now becomes a recovery operation and it will fall to experts from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch to try to establish exactly why the vessel went down so quickly without so much as a Mayday. The BBC understands that the footballer Ched Evans, who’s been convicted of rape, is in talks to join the League One club Oldham Athletic. He’s been trying to return to football after being released from prison in October. Last month Oldham denied reports they were about to offer him a contract, or the chance to train with them. Here’s our Sports Correspondent, Natalie Pirks. Asa As a convicted rapist on licence, Ched Evans’ chances of getting back into professional foot ball had started to appear bleak. But Oldham athletic could be about to prove when one door closes, another opens. Last month the club denied it wanted to sign him and today it has been unavailable to comment. The player’s union said a return could be announced tomorrow. He wishes to return to society as a footballer, but he needs an employer willing to take him on. He needs to show 100% commitment to that. If they wish to sign him as Ched Evans, the footballer, they need to get on with it. Ched Evans always maintained his innocence and an enquiry into his conviction is underway. When Sheffield United wanted them -- conviction is underway. When Sheffield United wanted them -- him to train with them, they pulled the offer when 160,000 people signed a petition against the idea. Now another petition has been cited saying his lack of remorse is a reason Oldham athletic should not sign him. In 2007, they signed Lee Hughes at the he signed heart of a six-year prison term for causing death by dangerous driving. -- half. Locals around boundary Park are split on whether the club should sign a can big did criminal. It will divide people’s opinions. It will be quite sensitive, but he is a good footballer. Supporters should vote whether they want it or not. It is UP whether they want it or not. It is up to the owners. If they want to sign him, they can but at least we have another member of the team. It is a big gamble for them to sign such a player. I don’t know what to think. When he scores his first goal, how many people will cheer? If fans don’t, the board will after four consecutive defeat and they are desperate the goals and an available striker is a solution they can ill afford to overlook. It’s emerged tonight that the car transporter beached in sand near the Isle of Wight was run aground deliberately to save the ship and her crew. The owners said the vessel, the Herk Osaka, had begun listing badly soon after it left Southampton, bound for Germany. From the scene, Robert Hall reports. She should have been well on her way to Bremerhaven. This evening, the Hoegh Osaka is beached and immoveable Alongside one of the UK’s busiest shipping channels. alongside one of the UK’s busiest Move closer and there is clear evidence of the emergency which unfolded late last night. Lifeboats verged on the bank after the captain took the decision to ground the vessel. They made the decision to ground her on the bank. This showed great skill and seamanship. These ships are regular visitors to Southampton and pilots underscored vessels help them navigate a challenging route into and out of the port. North of the Isle of Wight, the ships followed a channel around the sandbanks. The Herk Osaka had made her final turn and may be at risk of capsizing. When you get up close you get a sense of the problems. She is listing at about A5 degrees, lying on her side on top of the bramble sandbank will stop inside, cargo may have shifted and that will mean refloating hair may be more difficult. They will have to wait for the right tide and weather conditions. As crowds gathered on shore, maritime experts did what they could to assess the task. It is currently too dangerous to board the ship. Inside its giant hole of 500 tonnes of fuel oil and construction machines. We will have to make a decision at some stage whether we retain the fuel on board during the refloat attempt whether we may have consider removing some of the fuel before the actual refloat. The weather is due to deteriorate in a couple of days and tug boat may be needed round-the-clock to hold the Herk Osaka in position and prevent further damage until the salvage plan is ready. Now for some of the day’s other news. The London hospital treating the nurse who is seriously ill after contracting Ebola says there is no danger to staff or patients. Pauline Cafferkey’s condition remains critical tonight. She was infected while working in Sierra Leone and diagnosed in Glasgow a week ago, before being transferred to an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital. More than 8,000 people have died during the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. A six-year-old boy is in hospital with life-threatening injuries after a plane crash which killed his parents. Lewis Tonkinson and his wife Sally, who were from Warwickshire, died when the plane came down near Popham in Hampshire. Police investigating the murder of a woman in Cardiff on New Year’s Eve believe the suspect could have fled to Tanzania. Nadine Aburas, who was 28, was found in a hotel room. The man she was with, Sammy Almahri, is thought to have left the UK before her body was discovered. The Duke of York has returned to the UK from his skiing holiday in Switzerland, amid attention focused on him after an American woman claimed in legal papers she was forced to have sex with him whilst underage. The allegation has been strongly denied by Buckingham Palace. Our Royal Correspondent Peter Hunt is at the Palace and joins us. Peter how will the Prince be dealing with this now? Tonight, he is in Windsor, he has returned from a holiday that probably wasn’t that relaxing. It was on the ski slopes yesterday Prince Andrew took the president decision to issue two denials in two days. Unprecedented because the position is usually to say nothing. His mother, the Queen, was seen this morning at the church at Sandringham. In the coming days, he will talk to his mother, his lawyers and advisers. They insist he has done nothing wrong and it will be business as usual. But Prince Andrew does face challenges. His judgement and choice of friends have once again been called into question and he cannot control what happens in America. There could be fresh allegations and potentially it could inflict damage on Prince Andrew and the monarchy. Thank you. Some five million retired people could be able to swap their monthly pension income for a cash lump sum under plans proposed by the Pensions Minister. Steve Webb wants to extend changes being made to annuities, which pay a fixed regular income in retirement, to existing pensioners. But as our business correspondent joe Lynam reports, the plan faces a number of hurdles. And annuity is the regular income you get when you retire. Up to now you have been forced to swap the money you have saved up during your working life for this fixed, monthly payment. From this April you don’t have to buy an annuity when you retire. You can spend your savings on what you want. Now the pension Minister wants to go further by allowing up to 5 million people, already getting their pension, to cash it in for a lump sum. Many people will have a state pension, a company pension and an annuity as well. They should have the choice to go on as they are or convert some of the income into a cash sum, spend it on their home, their grandchildren or a holiday. It should not be the government telling them what to do with their money. Those retired people who prefer a cash lump sum to an annuity or monthly amount for life, shop around for the best quote from life insurance companies willing to buy out an annuity. ' could be subject to a medical checkup. All going well, you get your cash lump sum and the firm gets your annuity instead of you. Not everybody thinks it will work. There are risks for the investors, they could be offered a poor deal. It may not make sense for people to cash in their annuities. not make sense for people to cash in theirannuities. It their annuities. It is a long way from becoming reality and may be too complicated to work effectively. The Minister is hoping to build an all-party consensus on his plan before the election. If it fails he wants to make it a manifesto commitment for the Lib Dems should they find themselves in a new coalition after May. With all the sport, here’s Olly Foster at the BBC Sport Centre.

There were delays at Stansted Airport this morning after passengers arriving on a Ryanair flight went through the wrong door after it was left open by mistake. Passengers on the flight from Lisbon then had to be processed by security at departures, causing long queues. There’s now an investigation into what happened. Recording equipment that would have been used at the world famous Abbey Road studios in Stjohn’s Wood by The Beatles to produce some of their most famous music - is being used once again to meet the growing demand for vinyl records. Gareth Furby has been to meet the music enthusiast in west London - behind the idea. Pete Hutcheson is in love with the sound of vinyl records. So much so, he has now set up a company producing exact reproductions of rare classical recordings. Now back on sale at a premium price. £300. Original of this, £2000. This is £300. The reason we are remaking these records in the way we are is in order for people to enjoy the records as they would have been heard in the day. All this is possible because of a collection of antique machines tilt up in the studio in Westbourne Grove, West London. This is a Danish all valve cutting system made in the early 60s. The tapes we are cutting from were recorded in the 50s. We want to play them back on the original equipment through all the original circuitry. When we got it it was in a bad state. Now rebuilt, it works perfectly and the records, once cut and printed are selling. Even second-hand vinyl can command a high price. Why is vinyl, new and old, becoming popular again. price.

Egypt’s highest court has ordered the retrial of three Aljazeera journalists, who’ve spent more than a year in prison on terrorism-related charges. The men, including the former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, were given long prison sentences last year- in proceedings that have received international condemnation. Relatives said they were disappointed that the men were not released on bail. From Cairo Orla Guerin reports. £9VPt’s Egypt’s highest court gave its verdict today in a case which has been condemned around the world. After the briefest of hearings, it ordered a retrial ordered jailed Al jazeera journalists. Here they are at an earlier hearing, Australian Peter Greste, Egyptian Canadian Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed who was Egyptian. They were not brought to court for the ruling. A disappointed -- They were not brought to court for the ruling. A disappointed -- it’s disappointed their relatives, including Peter’s father.

Police in China are investigating how a stampede during New Year celebrations in Shanghai led to the deaths of 36 people - with dozens more injured. It happened just before midnight as huge crowds packed the city’s historic waterfront. From Shanghai, john Sudworth reports. On the morning after, this floral tribute was brought to the scene. Shanghai’s New Year disaster has left the country in shock and facing difficult questions. State media is calling it a wake-up call. Taking just 20 minutes or so before midnight, these photos show the police struggling against the sheer weight of the crowd, unable to rescue or treat those caught in the deadly crash. The authorities appear to have been caught off-guard, despite the fact that this year’s celebration, because of public safety concerns, had already been scaled back to keep crowds to a minimum. At hospitals across the city, relatives of the dead and injuries faced a distressing wait for news. Ijust want to faced a distressing wait for news. I just want to know what is going faced a distressing wait for news. Ijust want to know what is going on inside the hospital. Many relatives asked to go inside and asked the hospital to give us a list of the injured, including the conscious and unconscious ones, but no one got back to us.

Two people - a woman in her 80s and a man in his 60s - have died in a house fire in Deptford in south-east London. The fire brigade says members of the public attempted to rescue the victims from the blaze. Our correspondent Ben Geoghegan is there now. Ben, what do we know about what happened? The police forensic officers and other investigators are still here at the house, trying to work out what caused this fire. Several neighbours rang the fire brigade when they saw what was happening. At one point, apparently the house was engulfed in flames from the ground floor to the roof. Neighbours we have spoken to say there were flames coming out of the windows that gave onto the garden. A very serious fire. At one point, two members of the public went into the building but were unable to reach the people inside. Later on, the Fire Brigade recovered the bodies of a woman in her 80s and a man in his 60s. Some neighbours here are very upset. They said a woman has lived here for a long time it was well-known well liked. It is not the only tragic fire to have happened overnight. A 37-year-old man died in what some witnesses said was a fireball on the fourth floor of a block of flats in Plymouth. Thank you.

Surgeon behind a pioneering operation says he hopes to eventually get everyone out of wheelchairs. It was one of the biggest victories of 2014. It looks like a medical miracle. Derek, paralysed from the waist down when he was stabbed four years ago, walked again this year. A pioneering operation transplanted cells from his nasal cavity into his spinal-cord, encouraging nerves to regrow. When there is nothing, you can’t feel almost half of your body. You are very helpless and lost. When it begins to come back, it’s like starting afresh, as if you were born again. This image, just a snapshot of the decades of research behind a breakthrough, show spinal nerves in green are going through a red bridge of the transplanted cells. To make sure Derek’s recovery was not a phenomenal one off, the team behind it plans to repeat the operation. My dream is in this patient and the next, to see much more effective recovery of the motor function, enabling them to walk independently. This is still very much an experiment. The team does not want to raise false hopes not looking for volunteers. They will select patients with a specific type of injury to be part of the study. More hospitals, including one centre in London, will also test and into that -- test and independently assess the technique. This is not the final cure. It’s enough to get everyone trying out the different centres. We will have succeeded when people are taken out of our hands and do it. I hope we will get everyone out of wheelchairs. I think we have got a key that may get us a long way towards that. The UK is now a leading centre for degenerative medicine.

Egypt’s highest court has ordered a re-trial of three journalists from the Al-jazeera television network. The men have been in prison for more than a year on terrorism-related charges. The three, including the former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, were given long prison sentences last year provoking international condemnation. From Cairo, here’s Orla Guerin. jailed forjournalism. Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed. These images were taken during their first trial. Human rights groups say they should be released immediately and not tried all over again. The journalists were not in court for the brief hearing. The verdict was a blow to relatives who hoped they would get bail. But Peter Greste’s parents said he would stay strong. Producer Mohamed Fahmy tweeted from hospital where he has had surgery for an old injury.

Lawyers say at the first hearing they will apply for bail. This was Peter Greste on the streets of Cairo just before his arrest, reporting on a protest where the Muslim Brotherhood. It is now banned and repressed under Egypt’s authoritarian leadership. We know he will read the positivity and he won’t you downcast. He has held out so well so far, we are confident whatever distance we still have to run, we will all get her to the finishing line. Yeah. Cairo views Al-jazeera, owned by Qata as a mouthpiece for the Brotherhood. Many believe Peter Greste and his colleagues were targeted because of Doha’s support for the Islamists. But there are indications the case will be resolved sooner or later, not least because images like this have damaged Egypt greatly. And we can speak to Orla Guerin in Cairo. In terms of the timescale, we do have some more information to night? There is another possible avenue for resolving this case. Two of the families, Peter Greste eyes-macro family and the family of Mohamed Fahmy, have applied for deportation. This would be possible under a new law. It looked like it was tailor-made for this case. Under this, foreigners convicted of an offence here or are on trial can be deported to their home country. For Peter Greste, that would be Australia and for Mohamed Fahmy who holds Egyptian and US citizenship but it does not help the third victim, Baher Mohamed. But it is an avenue the families are exploring and say they are hopeful about. Thank you for now. Rail companies have agreed to adopt a new code of practice to ensure passengers are told about the cheapest available fares, after admitting that ticket machines don’t always offer travellers the best deal. It’s claimed that some passengers have been paying up to £100 more than necessary for their journey. Our correspondent Daniela Relph reports. Buying a train ticket can be baffling and expensive. Changes are aimed to ease confusion and save money. Self-service machines are often the most convenient way to buy a train ticket but they show the most expensive fares and not the range of prices. When you use one of these machines, it does not give you the best option to begin with. Ido find it’s complicated, I try to go and see my daughter at university. I just give up and drive. The reforms mean customers will have two automatically be offered all fares. From March, self-service machines must be labelled to warn it cheaper prices might be available at the ticket office. Many passengers don’t realise these machines do not always offer the best fares. The changes are aimed to ensure everyone knows how to get the cheapest ticket. Take a journey from Leeds to Birmingham. If you are buying from a Northern Rail ticket machine, a first class, any time return to Birmingham cost £271. But at the ticket office, a first-class off- peak return is EIZI9 30, a deal not offered at the self-service machine and one back can save you £121. Not all passengers have the flexibility to book tickets I2 weeks in advance. Some people have to turn up at the station and buy tickets from vending machines. If they are not being offered the cheapest there, the question needs to be asked, why not? There is concern the changes will drive people to the security of buying at the ticket office at a time whenjobs there buying at the ticket office at a time when jobs there are time whenjobs there are at risk. It will see an increase in workload for the ticket office staff. Staff want to provide the public with the best service but they are doing it at the backdrop with cuts across the network. Rail companies have welcomed the changes and say they are working hard to ensure ticket machines are easier to use. And the guarantee of the cheapest ticket possible will benefit rail passengers, as some face a new year rise in ticket prices due to be announced tomorrow.

They did that with this spectacular strike. The champions went further ahead. With Manchester City in control, Sunderland found renewed purpose. First jack Rodwell struck back before Adam johnson stunned the champions by levelling from the penalty spot. There was one further twist, a fifth goal in 16 frantic minutes. Frank Lampard showed why Manchester City have extended his contract by scoring the winner to give the blue half of Manchester are happy New Year. The red half began the day to put a difficult 2014 behind them. It was Stoke City who scored first. Peter Crouch with the header and Ryan Shawcross with the touch.

Three young British singer songwriter ‘s with the three bestselling albums of 2014. The top ten for the year is entirely British for the first time ever. In the first five years of the chart, only one British act had a number one and that was Tommy Steele. What has changed? It could be as simple as they are great albums by talented artists. Ed Sheeran, 1.8 million albums. Sam Smith has had a fantastic year. Notjust here, he is the only artist in the world to sell a million copies in the US and the UK. It is an incredible achievement for an artist 12 months ago, we had never even heard of. But it is not all about the new. Also in the top ten, the final album from Pink Floyd, the biggest seller of the year on vinyl. And while album sales do continue to fall, Ed Sheeran has proved the right act can still sell in old-fashioned quantities. Not bad for someone who says he only makes albums so that he can play live.

Tens of thousands of revellers welcomed in the New Year in Edinburgh. Scotland’s largest street party, Broadcast to an audience of over a billion. There were a few arrests for minor offences, and high winds caused the cancellation of sterling’s concert. Organisers here say it was a successful, say start of the New Year. The profile it gives to Scotland as a tourist destination is very important. This year we have seen an increase in international visitors, and visitors from over 70 countriesjoined us at Edinburgh’s Hogmanay. The celebrations continued this afternoon down the water. Edinburgh’s Lord Provost was among those who took a dip. It was really, really cold, but good fun. It was a fun thing to do. It wasn’t as cold as I thought it would be. Good fun. This Loony Dook is one of many daft events happening around Scotland, bringing in thousands of pounds for charities as well as drawing in the crowds. The good-natured atmosphere enhances Scotland’s reputation as a great place to bring in the New Year in style.

Egypt’s highest court has ordered a retrial of three journalists from the Aljazeera television network. They’ve been in prison for more than a year, convicted of collaborating with the banned opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood.

Their new trial is expected to begin within a month in a Cairo criminal Court. Lawyers say at the first hearing they will apply for bail. This legal case has a political backdrop. Aljazeera’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt views the channel, owned by Qatar, as a mouthpiece for banned Islamist. This was Peter Greste on the streets of Cairo just before his arrest, reporting on a Brotherhood protest. The award-winning reporter, daring to tell both sides of the story.

Give us a sense of what happens next. What are the options? The first thing on the agenda is this new trial which we believe will start within weeks. The hope is, on behalf of defence lawyers, that it will proceed more quickly than the original trial. There is a degree of caution. Peter Greste’s father said this evening, look, the first trial was flawed, condemned internationally, and we know it was unfair, and we have no guarantee that a second trial will not proceed along the same lines. There is another avenue being investigated by the families, and that is deportation. This is possible for foreign nationals convicted of offences in Egypt, or who are on trial. That is under a new regulation brought him back in November. At the time, it seemed tailor-made for this case. This would apply to Peter Greste, who is Australian, and also to the Canadian journalist. Both families have said they have a ready applied to the 30s here to have the men deported back to these foreign countries, where they could again be put on trial. We don’t know if the requests will be accepted. This is new territory. That is one possibility. A last possibility is that when legal proceedings conclude, if the men are not acquitted, the president could step in and issue a pardon for all three. He has suggested in the past that that was under consideration. Thank you.

The London Assembly’s Conservative leader says now is the time to be honest about what he calls the scandal of the wasted millions. Legacy is the last thing that was thought of. It was all about the Games and the reputations of politicians. That is the problem and the difficulty for a police involved with it to say, you know, we got it wrong. Spending too much money in the wrong time at the wrong place. Recently, the public body set up to oversee the regeneration of the park has confirmed another £35 million to convert the stadium into a football ground and another EMO million to help create a complex on the site with housing, retail and arts institutions. We have a beautiful park. Excellent facilities, a pretty good shopping centre but we are waiting for some of the jobs centre but we are waiting for some of thejobs and of the jobs and the affordable housing to come to the area. That is what the community was promised. In a statement it t the London development corporation Only in 20 or 30 years will we know as Londoners if it has truly delivered. Two people, a woman in her eighties and a man in his sixties, have died in a house fire in Deptford. The fire brigade says members of the public tried to rescue them. Charlotte Franks has more. Forensic officers and Fire Brigade investigators, trying to work out what caused this devastating fire that left two people dead. When I come I see sparkles, windows smashing and dark, black smoke. I came out of my front door. I saw there was a lot of people outside, a lot of smoke and flames. Several neighbours apparently rang the Fire Brigade when they saw what was happening, and two members of the public went into the building but were unable to reach the people inside. Later, the Fire Brigade recovered the bodies of a woman in her ‘80s and a man in his ‘60s. The victims’ next of kin are currently in the process of being informed and the police say that they are awaiting the results of the investigation. Thousands of people took to the capital’s streets for the New Years Day Parade today. The theme was London On The Move and it featured a collection of vehicles from the capital’s past from steam engines to classic cars. Chris Rogersjoined the crowds. In the 1980s, the streets of London were quiet and deserted on New Year’s Day. Happy New Year London! Then someone came up with an idea for an American-inspired New Year’s day Parade. It is now into its 29th year, breathing life into the capital. WE COTTIE âVâI’y YEBI’. Every year? What brings you here every year in the pouring rain and freezing cold? The parade! The pouring rain we come. We’ve never been here to see this and we’re looking forward to it. It’s absolutely wonderful. Everybody coming together, the marching bands. The youngsters always smiling as they come past. This year’s theme, London on the Move. Celebrating the past, present and the future of transport. The entertainment? Provided by America’s traditional parade bands. We have been in London for three days now. We thought we would make the most of it and come to the New Year’s Day Parade. So, the first time in London for 30 years, from North Wales. The first time for the kids as well. What are you looking forward to most today? I am looking forward to the band and the dancing. Wonderful, so far. Yeah, and it’s the same with everything. Like if you see the Trooping of the Colour. There is always something in London. Always. You’re obviously a very proud Londoner. I know. A very proud Londoner. And happy New Year to you too! Amateur treasure hunters have uncovered one of the biggest hoards of ancient coins ever found in Britain. A group using metal detectors found more than 5,000 perfectly-preserved Anglo Saxon coins buried in a lead bucket in a field, near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. The coins will be examined by the British Museum. If the coins are legally treasure,thefinders could share treasure,the finders could share a windfall of up to £1 million with the landowner. Well that’s it from me. But let’s take a look at the weather now. Nick Miller’s here. Nick. Despite the sunshine tomorrow, the temperatures will be lower. There is a chill in the breeze. It is windy, cloudy and wet without breaks of rain working through the night. Gusty winds but at the end of the night, that pushes away and the skies clear and the temperatures come down but not until the end of the night. When we are up and about in the morning, most of us will be greeted by the sunshine. Staying that way. There will be a chill in the breeze, bringing the temperatures down for many into single figures. The weather is up and down over the next few days. On Saturday, it is back to mild by wet with rain. On Sunday it is dry but colder again. What about the rest of the UK? What a start to 2015. Mild across the board. One or two places getting up to 15 Celsius. But the mild air does not last long, to be replaced by something colder. Tomorrow offers a different feel with colder air. And a different look to the day. It could be wet and wind windy for some. In the next hour, there could be gusts of rain up to 60 miles an hour. Clearing from the south-east, then behind it clearing skies, dropping temperatures and for the north of the UK showers over the hills of Scotland. By the end of night, temperatures dipping into the single figures across the board. In the morning we have the wintry showers across Scotland. Moving quickly, given the strength of the wind. There may be sleet and a rumble of thunder. Some wintry weather in Northern Ireland. Most of us getting off to a pleasant day. A little on the chilly side but with sunshine to compensate. Warmer on the south coast, less cold at eight Celsius. A bright and a breezy start for many. Keeping it windy over Scotland. Blowing a gale for some. The showers tend to fade in the middle of the day but keeping the strong winds going. More rain, sleet and snow on the way for later on. Temperatures dropping by south-easterly degrees in comparison to today. The first part of the weekend, we have to change the script to wet and windy again. By the end of the afternoon, the rain will have cleared. Then changing again. # Oh, I wanna play darts with somebody ",,
194,BBC1 London,21-jan-2015,Joins BBC News,01:40,260 mins,True,"a mixture of rain, sleet and snow, most of the snow falling over the hills, particularly in the Peak District. Further North - the far North of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland seeing sunshine at times. Still a few more wintry showers, especially in the North West, and again it will feel pretty cold out there, too. But as we run through the night and into Thursday, the drying-up process continues, the rain, sleet and snow mix continuing to slowly peter out. A lot of cloud around, but where the cloud breaks we’ll see a frost, particularly across the Northern half of the UK, but also some patches of freezing fog as well. Nothing to move those, no wind to shake things up, so that will linger through the morning, any of that fog, but most places will probably start off grey and cloudy. We should see it brightening up, particularly in the South East with some sunshine. Maybe the North East of Scotland, but for most it will be another cold and drab sort of day. Signs of change in the North West later with some rain coming in. A more significant change, really, on Friday, because we’ve got some more isobars on the chart- an indication that we’ll have some stronger wind, and these weather fronts are going to bring cloud and this time mostly rain. Now, it’s moving slowly down towards the South East. The morning should be dry here and may be quite bright and still quite cold for a while, but temperatures slowly climbing to 7 to 9 degrees. That weather system out of the way, really, on Friday night. Next one racing in from the Atlantic, but on Saturday we’re in between two weather systems. A ridge of high-pressure across the UK. Still a lot of dry weather. A lot of sunshine, particularly for England and Wales. For a while, some sleet and snow showers in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Those should fade away as cloud increases. Quite a stronger wind and it will feel colder for the start of the weekend, but probably only briefly. The next weather system racing in - a deep, low well to the North of us, but some stronger winds are likely during the second half of the weekend. South-westerly winds blowing in rain this time. Some quite heavy rain in the North, and with temperatures possibly getting into double figures in Western Scotland and Northern Ireland, there’ll be some significant snow melt as well, so the threat of some flooding. We’re into the milder air on Sunday because the jet stream is further North, but the jet stream is going to buckle and dive its way southwards again on Monday, drawing down some colder air. And that’s going to be a theme, really, through next week, very similar to what we’ve had for most of the winter. A day or two of something milder, wetter, windier, and a day or two of something a little bit colder and possibly a little bit wintry, but it does look more changeable, more unsettled and more windy next week. The strongest winds and the wettest weather are likely to be across the North West of the UK. It shouldn’t be quite as cold as we’re seeing right now - those temperatures closer to average. themes that he will hit night is vindication, he will take credit for that recovering economy, in excerpts released, he says that the verdict of them.

This is 2009, the president is in his first State of the union. This was him last week. It always takes your tour, those before and after, what is the bottom line? Two years left, what does he have to do? He has a lot to do like Ronald Reagan did. Going into the seventh year of his presidency, he is a bit older than President Obama. What he was able to do is convince the country that his economic programme worked. That is exactly what President Obama has to do tonight, convince people that the recovery is sustainable and can be broadened to everyone, everyone can share in this bounty. It is because of the work that he did over the last six years. Ronald Reagan was able to make that cell, he came on to the speech with a 60% approval rating as well. He can convince them that the programme worked. -- rating as well. He can convince them that the programme worked. -- sell. One of the most prestigious hospitals in Boston was on lockdown. The chaos from above, inside, a gunman opened fire, targeting a surgeon. Tonight, officials warned it could have been worse, those medical workers had trained for it. Boston police received the call. A doctor shot and injured at one of the city’s most prestigious hospital. They were telling us to get down and get to the elevator. It was pretty scary. Police said the suspect had asked for the doctor by name when he entered the hospital. A cardiac surgeon shot twice. Injuries said to be life-threatening. Something in the past upset this man to come looking for this particular doctor. The hospital does not have metal detectors, but they do have active drills. Violence at places of healing is unfortunately one of the hidden dangers. In Minnesota, a patient armed with a metal bar went on a rampage. The incident caught on camera.

The trial of the accused gunman is now getting under way. You will remember that look. He was virtually unrecognisable as his parents now plead for their son’s life. Today"", james Holm ‘s looked more like a coUege james Holm ‘s looked more like a college student used to be. Even laughing with his attorneys, a different look than this. 12 people were killed, 70 injured. Now a 27-year-old is one of the few mass shooters to ever face trial. The first of 7000 potentialjurors began reporting today. He had met he was the gunman, but his attorneys say he was insane. Many believe justice comes only with the death penalty. Not all. My niece will never walk again. She is 26 years old. This woman’s niece is now paralysed. Her six your old daughter was killed. For her, he death penalty will bring fresh pain and appeals. I would like to see him locked up with no possibility of parole. He did monstrous things. He is a monster. The parents hope there are some will be spared. But picking 12jurors But picking 12 jurors will take months, opening statements are not expected until May at the earliest. Thank you. We move onto that bridge collapse in Ohio. A construction crew killed, a driver injured. Concrete plunging in an instant. Tense moment overnight along the highway in Lots of concrete and machinery plummeting onto the highway after this overpass collapsed. It wasjust after It was just after 10:30pm that the overpass was being demolished as part of the widening project when it somehow gave way. Acer might truck driving underneath crashing into the crumbling concrete. The driver miraculously surviving with just minor injuries. But a construction worker was killed. Authorities now working to figure out how an ordinary demolition turned deadly. It is a routine operation for the most part. We have done it on other projects. Virtual records show the overpass was in decent shape and was rated 84. But in 2013, more than 66,000 deficient temperatures were found across the country. Traffic is now halted as crews work to clean up the scene. At this point it is still unclear exactly when the stretch will reopen. Authorities say there are thankful this did not happen during the rush hour. Now to that store and on the move. -- storm. Let us get straight to the chief bit urologist. Let us talk timing.

The home burning to the ground. The family missing for a time. Tonight, federal investigators are trying to determine what started an inferno at this Merrylands mansion. Firefighters still extinction hotspots after the fire brought this 16,000 square feet mentioned to the ground. There are six people unaccounted for. Visiting Sunday night, believed to have been inside during the blaze, or missing. The construction of the house contained a lot of heavy materials. From here you can still smell the smoke. The fire is still smouldering. Nearly 40 hours after it began. The fire reported at 3:30 a.m.. Experts say that more than half a car overnight, spreading fast. They were the most generous and loving people. At the gates, a makeshift memorial. This family waits for word of their loved ones. Street to the index. Pope Francis offending a lot of Catholics.

Finally, we know throwing birthday parties is expensive. But how far is to fight in train to get back money when children do not show UP back money when children do not show up as Denmark after this five-year old bail on his friend’s Earth Day party in England, his father found a brown envelope in the school back.

I am understanding of her losing money. In the end, Alex probably will not be invited back next year. See you tomorrow night. We have snow falling across parts of the country. A smothering of frost for others. There could be disruption tomorrow morning, so stay tuned to the latest weather updates. We are talking about mostly eastern Wales, around the Midlands and also northern England. We could see a few centimetres of snow lying on the ground, so it could be slippery on the roads. What is happening right now is we have an area of low pressure, and a weather front slicing the UK here. It’s to the east where we have the colder air. It is quite a volatile situation. These areas of rain, sleet and snow are very hit and miss. It isn’t one big, coherent area of snow or rain. It is very broken up. That is why we are seeing these localised areas of snow. First thing in the morning it is eastern Wales, the Midlands and northern England, the Peak District, to the south, we are talking about rain with snow mixing in maybe across the North and South Downs, the London area. We don’t expect snow to settle further south across the country. Another area to point out is Northern Ireland and the south-west of Scotland as well as the lowlands, could be wintry weather here first thing with temperatures very close to freezing. What’s going to happen through the course of Wednesday? For many of us, the story says it all, it is a grey day with a wintry mix of weather. There will be sunshine around for sure. The best of the weather is eastern Scotland, the Borders, Newcastle and Edinburgh could be a fine day but cold. These are the temperatures we could get, for some of us, not far off freezing through the day, and it is balmy in Plymouth, seven degrees, relatively speaking. Mist and fog on Thursday morning with frost too. Sunshine in the afternoon. A cold day again. Thursday and Friday, we start to see the cold air pushing away and this milder Atlantic air is going to filter in, so things are going to - at least they look as though now - turn a little bit warmer with Atlantic winds coming from the west and pushing in some weather fronts. As well as slightly milder conditions, less cold, I should say, there will be a little bit of rain once again. That’s it. Bye bye. Welcome to this BBC News special. We have live coverage of President Obama’s state of the union address. Injust a few minutes, the President will deliver his state of the union address to the American public and the world. But this year the President faces a new challenge, with Republicans controlling both the House of Representatives and the US Senate. Tonight we expect to hear about a number of issues ranging from the economy to combatting Islamic State. With us throughout the night is Alexis Simendinger, White House correspondent for Real Clear Politics. We we re We were just saying we couldn’t believe it was a year since the last one. It seemed to zip I! How much did he get done over the past year, and how much will he get done over the next year? From last year’s speech, he got maybe two initiatives stun, legislatively. Out of the roster of things all presidents propose at the beginning of the year. What is so dramatic this year is that he is facing a Republican-controlled Congress top at the other interesting thing is he seems to have quite a burden on his shoulders. Untilthe mid-term shoulders. Until the mid-term elections shoulders. Untilthe mid-term elections he did terribly, and now he feels liberated. His poll numbers went up, and the White House said it wasn’t so much liberation as much as it is this forceful vision for the middle class. The idea of being defeated in November, his poll numbers have gone up and it didn’t set him back, and he is mixing executive power and legislative power, and we will see that tonight. Even if he comes out of this with a laundry list of things he wants to get done, and not many get done, a lot of the State of the Union speech is about optics and atmosphere on how the President presents himself. We are led to believe that this will be less about a laundry list and more about values and vision. I did a quick scan of the first couple of pages in his speech, in about that 10th paragraph he talks about it not being partisan. And by the 25th paragraph is talking about control. There is a lot of that Obama language in this. A lot of uplifting language. I think the President will try to appeal to America and say, listen, you are playing a part because of the policies that have been put in place. You are doing a good job, and thatis place. You are doing a good job, and that is something you should keep on doing. It is squarely aimed at the people in the middle stock yellow when you are giving a speech when you are heading into your 70 and you want to give a victory walk about the veteran economy -- want to give a victory walk about the veteran economy -- 70 year, and you want to argue optimism, vision, and the view of America. 75% of Americans put themselves in the middle class and self identify as that. Is really talking to most of the country. They call this date night, don’t they? When the Democrats and Republicans try to act like they are friends before they pick up the cudgels and do battle. That happened one year, the Democrats are in smaller numbers this year. They get to self select their seats. They don’t have assigned seats, so we will see whether they sit in tribes or whether they mix together. Here is a fun fact. Some of the members of Congress will have waited for three hours in order to sit right next to the Isle whether President will come down -- the Isle whether President will come down -- aisle. You would think they would have better things to do for three hours, but they want to sit there having a good seat. It is not just the senators and Congress who are there tonight, Michelle Obama is flanked by people she has invited. A couple of LA police people she had invited for the work they are doing in that community. They want those symbols to be there, ordinary people who have come to the capital because of the work they are doing in the country. You are talking about how presidents like tell stories, and since Ronald Reagan’s speech we have seen presidents bring guests to the first Lady’s box. These show examples of what they consider success, orachievements. examples of what they consider success, or achievements. As you point out, there are also members of the cabinet. The transportation Secretary will be there, Anthony Fox. He is offsite in a secure location with the nuclear codes and Secret Service protection. I was speaking to someone who was offsite a few weeks ago, and he said you go to this location about 100 miles outside Washington, and you go into a bunker and outside Washington, and you go into a bunkerand you a bunker and you can the whole scenario of their being an attack on Congress while you are there. The president of the United States! The president of the United States being introduced for his sixth State of the Union address. There are people who have been waiting for hours with that vantage point. I suspect they know they will get to shake the hand of the President, and they also know they will be on camera. They will be on camera, they get the kisses, and when he is done they will crowd around him to get his autograph on their programme. We will see them at the beginning and at the end. This is a slow progress until he reaches the rostrum and delivers his State of the Union address. You can read his lips. How are you? Is calling them all by name. He knows everyone much better than when he first started, but he has a whole lot of newcomers to get through. Then he greets all the members of the cabinet and the Supreme Court justices, and he moves up to sit in front ofjoe Biden and john Boehner in order to front ofjoe Biden and john Boehner in orderto give in order to give the address. We will hear tonight, often when people are watching the State of the Union address from around the world, they often wonder where the world will feature in their speech. Sometimes we hear almost nothing. Under President Bush, after the axis of evil line in the State of the Union address, foreign policy dominated. I suspect there will be more on foreign policy tonight in the light of Paris attacks on there might have been had this been given a month ago. We know that President Obama spoke to the French president today by phone. These discussed a whole range of issues, and I think you are right. Usually, foreign policy comes at the end of the speech, and this helps to tell the story about American leadership abroad. And he knows that Republicans who control Congress are very interested in talking to him about these issues. It is also six months ago when the American people were not talking about Islamic State, or ISIL, or ISIS, orwhatever about Islamic State, or ISIL, or ISIS, or whatever acronym you want to give that organisation that has been responsible for such a people in turmoil, and the execution of hostages in Syria and Iraq. Guy we know that tonight, President Obama will ask Congress to vote on a resolution to authorise the use of force that is already under way to neutralise Islamic State in Iraq. That might be something they will get out of the speech. It seems to be the least controversial. I wonder if we will hear much about cyber security. There was the hack of Sony late last year, the hacking on Facebook last week. That is a major issue, and now the President is arriving to deliver his State of the Union. APPLAUSE Thank you! Thank you. Members of Congress are have the height privilege of resenting TU the president of the United States. -- to you. Thank you so much. Mr Speaker, Mr Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans. We are 15 years into this new century. 15 years that dawned with Terra touching our shores, that unfolded with the new generation fighting to Long and costly wars, that sort of vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been and still is a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, Tonight, after a breakthrough year forAmerica, our economy Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. APPLAUSE Our unemployment rate is now lower thanit Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis, more of our kids are graduating than ever before, more of our people are insured than ever before. APPLAUSE And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we have been in almost 30 years. APPLAUSE Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain, and we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. APPLAUSE America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this. The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. At this moment, with the growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production, we have risen from recession free to write our own future than any other nation on earth. It is now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come. We accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well, or will we commit ourselves to an economy which has rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and react, dragged into costly conflicts that strained military? Will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another? Orwill we factions and turned against one another? Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. In the months ahead, I will criss-cross the country, making a case for those ideas. So, tonight, Iwant to country, making a case for those ideas. So, tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices were for us. -- for us. It begins with our economy. Seven years ago, Rebecca and then of Minneapolis were newly weds -- Ben. She waited tables, he worked construction, theirfirst She waited tables, he worked construction, their first child, jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America. And it doesn’t get much better than that. If only we had known Rebecca wrote to me last week what was about to happen to the housing and construction market. As the crisis worsened, Benz business dried up, so he took what jobs worsened, Benz business dried up, so he took whatjobs he could find, evenif he took whatjobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time -- Ben’s. Rebecca took out student loans and in rolled in community coal and retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And slowly it paid off. They bought their first home. slowly it paid off. They bought theirfirst home. They their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebecca got a betterjob and then a raise. Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night. It is amazing, Rebecca wrote, what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are strong, tightknit family who has made it through some very hard times. We are a strong, tightknit family who has made it through some very hard times. America, Rebecca and Ben’s story is our story. They represent the millions who have worked hard and sacrificed and retooled. You are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I store in on the steps of this capital and promised to rebuild the economy on a new foundation -- stood. It has been your resilience, your effort, that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and bring newjobs to our shores and over the last five years our businesses have created more than 11 million newjobs. APPLAUSE. We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. America is number one in oiland protect our planet. America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008, and thanks to lower gas prices and higherfuel standards, the and higher fuel standards, the typicalfamily and higherfuel standards, the typicalfamily this year and higherfuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump. APPLAUSE. We believed we could repair our kids for a more competitive world and today our younger students have earned the highest maths and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. More Americans finish college than ever before. APPLAUSE. We believe that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin and encourage fair competition. Today we have new tools to stop taxpayer funded bailouts and a new consumer watchdogs to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. In the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. APPLAUSE. At every step, we were told our goals were misguided, too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead we have seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade. The deficit has been cut by two thirds. The stock market has doubled and health-care inflation is at its lowest rate in 50 years. APPLAUSE. This is good news, people. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE. So, the verdict is clear: Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. These policies will continue to work as long as politics don’t get in the way. We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns and fiscal showdowns. We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health-insurance or unravelling the new rules on Wall Street, or read fighting last titles on immigration when we have got to fix a broken system. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it, they will have earned my veto. APPLAUSE. Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay that at any time since 2007. Here is the thing, those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t screw things up. That the government doesn’t halt the progress we are making. We need to do more thanjust do no harm. Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. APPLAUSE. Because families late Rebecca’s still need our help -- lake. She and Ben are working as hard as ever. They have had to forego vacations and new cars so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday night pizza, that is a big splurge. Basic childcare forjack and Henry cost more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hard-working Americans, Rebecca ha rd-working America ns, Rebecca isn’t hard-working Americans, Rebecca isn’t asking for a handout. She is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances. And to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizen schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet, tools needed to go as far as their efforts and dreams will take them. That’s what middle-class economics is. The idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot. When everyone does their fair share. Everyone plays by the same set of rules. APPLAUSE. We don’tjust want everyone to share in America’s success, we want everyone to share in America’s success, we wa nt everyone to contribute to our success. APPLAUSE. So, what does middle-class economics require an ourtime? So, what does middle-class economics require an our time? -- in our time? First, it means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. It means helping folks afford childcare, college, healthcare, home, retirement, my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. APPLAUSE. Here is one example: During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority. This country provided universal childcare. In the day’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. APPLAUSE. It isn’t a nice to have, it is a must have. It is time to stop treating childcare as a side issue or as a women’s issue and treat it like the national economic priority thatitis like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. APPLAUSE. And that is why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle-class and low income family with young children in America by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3000 per child per year. APPLAUSE. Here is another example: Today, we are the only advanced country on earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. 43 million workers have no paid sick leave. 43 million. Think about that. That forces to many parents to make the gut wrenching choice between the PGY the gut wrenching choice between the pay cheque and the sick kid at home. So, I will be taking new action to help states adopt these on their own. And when it was on the ballot in November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. That’s the right thing to do. APPLAUSE. It’s the right thing to do. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. APPLAUSE. This is 2015. It’s time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they have earned. APPLAUSE. And everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimal a Jaya still refuses to raise the minimal a jaya say this, if you believe you can work full-time and support a family less than $15,000 a year, try it. If not, vote to give millions of hardest working people in America a razor. -- a raise. These ideas would make all people rich, would relieve every hardship, thatis rich, would relieve every hardship, that is notjob the of government. To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and realise that investing in the workforce is in their company’s long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers are voice. But, you know... Things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And that’s what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do. Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of Gls to college, trained at best workforce in the world. We were ahead of the curve. At other countries caught on, and in a 21st-century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in threejob openings will By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in free. We still live in a country where too many bright, striding Americans are pushed out of the education they need. It is not good for them, and it is not smart for our future. That is why I am sending this Congress are bold new plan to lower the cost of community college... To zero. APPLAUSE Keepin Keep in mind, 40% of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out, some are older and looking for a betterjob. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt. Understand, you had to earn it. You have to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community couege are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America. So two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. Let’s stay ahead of the curve. And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt is not derail any one’s dreams. Thanks to Vice Presidentjoe Biden’s wonderfuljob to upgrade our system, we are connecting community college is with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, nursing, Robotics. Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CPS and UPS and offer more educational opportunities and paid a pretty ships. Opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education. As the new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American dream they helped defend. Already we have made strides towards ensuring that everyone has access to the highest quality care. We are slashing the backlog but had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need. And we have two help veterans to transfer their skills into existing jobs. A programme by Michel andjill Biden, almost Michel and jill Biden, almost 700,000 Michel andjill Biden, almost 700,000 veterans have been able to get a newjob. APPLAUSE So, every CEO in America, if you want somebody who is going to get something done and done right, hire a veteran. APPLAUSE Finally, as we get a train our workers we need the new economy to keep churning out high wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work and Europe, japan and, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 newjobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are millions of Americans that work in jobs that didn’t exist ten or 20 years ago. jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla. No one knows for certain which industries will generate jobs of the future, but we do know we want them here in America. We know that. That is why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere. A place where businesses want to locate and hire. Houthi first century infrastructure is needed. Modern ports and bridges, fastest trains, and the fastest internet. Congress is to agree on this, so let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline, let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create almost 30 times more jobs every year and make country stronger for the generations to come. Let’s do it. Get it done! Let’s get it done! 21st-century business, including small business, it needs to sell more American product overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. exporters tend to pay their workers higherwages. But higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest growing region. That would put our workers are now businesses at a disadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field. That is why I am asking both parties to give me authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe, that are not just free but are also there. It is the right thing to do. -- fair. ~ Iam the I am the first want to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that is why we have gone up to countries that break the rules at our expense. 95% of the world’s customers live outside our borders. He can’t close ourselves from those opportunities -- we. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they are actively looking to bring jobs back from China, so let’s give them one more reason to get that done. 21st century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want a country that eliminated polio and mapped the human gene to lead a new era of medicine. One that delivers the right treatment at the right time. In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this has reversed a disease once thought impossible. Tonight, I’m launching a new medicine initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes, and to give all of us access to the personalised information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. I intent to support a free and open internet, to help its reach to every community. And help folks build the fastest network so the next generation of innovators have the platform to keep reshaping our world. I want Americans to win the race for the kind of discoveries that unleash newjobs. Turning sunlight into liquid fuel. Creating revolutionary prosthetics were veteran who gave arms to his country can play catch with his kids again. Pushing out into the solar system, notjust Pushing out into the solar system, not just to visit Pushing out into the solar system, notjust to visit but to stay. Last month we launched a new spacecraft as part of the new re-energised space programme that will send American astronauts to Mars. In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. Good luck, Captain, make sure you Instagram it! APPLAUSE The truth is when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there is bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everyone else does as well. But for far too long, lobbyists have used loopholes allowing some corporations to pay nothing, while others pay too much. They have riddled it with breaks that wealthy people don’t need, and cracking down on a class people who do. So let’s reward those who invest in America. -- middle-class. Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let’s simplify the system and that a small-business owner of file based on her actual bank statement, instead of a number of accountants she can afford. Let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top 1% to avoid paying taxes on their accumulate wealth. We can use that money to help poorfamilies pay the childcare and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans try to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. We can achieve it together. Helping hard-working families make ends meet, giving them the tools they need for good paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it is where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger, a yearfrom now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead. Of course, if there is one thing this new century has taught us it is that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. Ourfirst duty work here at home from challenges beyond our shores. Our first duty as commander-in-chief is to defend the US. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headphones instead of using our heads, when the first response to challenge is to send a military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflict, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That is what our enemies want us to do. I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy. When we leverage our power with coalition bill, and don’t let our fears blind our power with coalition bill, and don’t let ourfears blind us don’t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents. That is what we’re doing right now, and the globe it is making a difference. First, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists, from the streets in Pakistan to Kabul. We will continue to dismantle their networks and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly, to take out terrorists who pose a threat to us and hours. At the same time, we have learned costly lessons over the last 13 yea rs. costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we have trained their security forces who have now taken the lead and we have honoured our troop sacrifice or supporting that country’s first democratic transition. Instead of sending ground forces overseas we are partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa. To deny it safe havens to terrorists threatening America. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping the advanced of ISIL. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East we are leading a broad coalition including Arab nations to degrade and destroy this terrorist group. APPLAUSE. We are also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere to stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission I passing a resolution to authorise the use of force against ISIL. We need that authority. Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We are upholding the principle that bigger nations cannot bully the small. By opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine’s democracy and reassuring our Nato allies. APPLAUSE. Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions, with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence, with frontline states, Mr Putin’s aggression it was suggested was a display of strategy and strength, that’s what I heard from some folks. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters. That’s how America leads, not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. APPLAUSE. And on Cuba we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. APPLAUSE. When what you are doing doesn’t work for 50 years, it is time to try something new. APPLAUSE. And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere, it removes the phone its use for restrictions in Cuba, stands UP use for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values and extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. This year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. APPLAUSE. As his Holiness, Pope Francis has said, diplomacy is the work of small steps. These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Grose is back where he belongs. Welcome home, Alan, Iam glad you are here. APPLAUSE. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we have halted the progress of its nuclear programme and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a conference of agreement that prevents a nuclear armed Iran, secures America and our allies including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed. And I can keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. New sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails. Alienating and America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear programme again. It doesn’t make sense. And that’s why I will veto any new sanctions that threatens to undo this progress. APPLAUSE. The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort. And I intend to stay true to that wisdom. Third, we are looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century. No foreign nation, no hacker should shut down our networks or invade the privacy of our American families, or invade the privacy of our Americanfamilies, especially American families, especially our kids. APPLAUSE. So, we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. Tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks come combat identity theft and protect our children’s information, that should be a bipartisan effort. APPLAUSE. If we don’t act, we leave our nation vulnerable. If we do, we can protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the world. In West Africa, our troops, around the world. In West Africa, ourtroops, our our troops, our scientists, our doctors, nurses, healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. APPLAUSE. I could not be proud of them. And I think this Congress for their support of their efforts -- prouder. Thejob is not yet done and the world needs to learn this lesson to build eight more effective global effort to prevent future Pandev -- pandemics and eradicate extreme poverty. In the Asia-Pacific, we are modernising hell we trade, -- how we trade, how we participate in non-proliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge, no challenge, poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. APPLAUSE. 2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record. Won here doesn’t make a trend but this does -14 of the 15 warmest years on record have fallen on the first 15 years of this century. I have heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they are not scientists, that we don’t have enough information. Well, I am not a scientist either, but you know what? I know a lot of really good scientist at NASA and that our major universities and the best scientist in the world all tell us that our activities are changing the climate and if we don’t act forcefully, we will continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heatwaves, dangerous droughts and floods and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe -- scientists. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. APPLAUSE. And that’s why over the past six years we have done more than ever to combat climate change from the way we produce energy to the way we use it. That’s why we have set aside more public lands and waters that any administration in history and that’s why I will not let this Congress in danger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our effort. I am determined to make sure that American leadership dries international action. APPLAUSE. that American leadership dries internationalaction. APPLAUSE. -- international action. APPLAUSE. -- drives. internationalaction. APPLAUSE. -- drives. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement, the US will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution and China committed for the first time the limiting their emissions. And because the worlds two largest economies came together other nations are stepping UP together other nations are stepping up -- world’s. In offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we have got. And there is one last pillar of our leadership, and fats the example of our values. -- that’s. As Americans, we respect human dignity even when we are threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. It is why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It is why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That is why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do but ultimately because they will make us a far. -- safer. APPLAUSE. As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. APPLAUSE. As Americans, we have a profound commitment tojustice. So, it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open at present that the world condemns and terrorist’s used to recruit. -- use. Since I have been president we have worked responsibly to cut the population in half. Now it is time to finish thejob population in half. Now it is time to finish the job and I won’t relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. It is time to close want -- It is not who we are. It is time to close want-- Guantanamo. As Americans we cherish our civil liberties and we need to hold our limit if we want to operation from other countries and industries to fight against terrorist network. While some have moved on from the debates of our surveillance programmes, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard with the recommendations privacy advocates to increase transparency and build safeguards against potential abuse. We will issue a report on how we are keeping our promised to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy. Looking to the future, instead of the past -- Looking to the future, instead of the past-- promise. Making sure we match our power with diplomacy. And use force wisely. Putting coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. -- building. Leading always with the example of our values. That’s what makes us exceptional. That’s what keeps a strong. That’s why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest standards. Our own. You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there was no Liberal America or conservative America, black America or white America, but a United States of America. I said this because I had seen it in my own life. In a nation that gave someone like me a chance. Because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs. Because I made Illinois mY and customs. Because I made Illinois my home. The state of small towns, rich farmland. One of the worlds great cities. A microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and independents, could people of every ethnicity at every faith, share certain bedrock values -- world’s. Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It has held up this proof and notjust my own floors of which there are many, but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided. Naive. That there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship than gridlock for us to ever do anything about it. I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together we can do great things, even when the odds are long. ~ I believe this because over and over, through my six years in office, I have seen America at its best. I have seen the hopefulfaces of young graduates, and newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, blue London, I have mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown and Boston and west Texas and West Virginia. I have watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf coast to the great Plains. From midwest assembly lines to the mid Atlantic seaboard. I have seen something like a marriage go from a wedge issue used to drivers apart, to a story of freedom across our country. A civil right now legal in states that seven /10 Americans call home. Sol So I know the good, and optimistic, and bighearted generosity of the American people, who every day leave the idea that we are our brothers’ and sisters’ keeper. I know that they expect those of us who served here to set a better example. So, the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America’s hopes. I have served in Congress that many of you, I know many of you well. There are a lot of people here on both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this is not what you signed up for. Arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision. Imagine if we broke out of this tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different. Understand, that politics is not one where Democrats abandon their agenda of Republicans simply embrace mind, it is one where we appeal to each other’s bassist decency rather than our bassist fears. One where we talk issues and values and principles and facts, ratherthan issues and values and principles and facts, rather than gotcha moments, trivial gas, or issues that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives. -- basest. A better politics is one where we spent less time drowning in dark money that will drag us into the gutter and spend time lifting young people with a sense of purpose and possibility. Asking them to join sense of purpose and possibility. Asking them tojoin in the sense of purpose and possibility. Asking them to join in the great mission of building America. If we are going to have arguments, let’s have arguments, but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country. We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it is a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows and that every woman should have access to the healthcare she needs. Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when hard-working mums are snatched from their children. And that it is possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I have talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. It is something that we can share. We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred, that it is being denied to too many. And that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Sommer to Montgomery, and the passage of the voting rights act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. -- Selma. We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed. Surely we can understand a wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. And surely we can agree that it is a good thing that for the first time in 40 years the crime rate in the incarceration rate have come down together. And use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans. Community leaders and law enforcement, to reform the criminaljustice system so it protect and serves all of us. That is a better politics. That is how we start rebuilding trust. That’s how we move this country forward. That’s what the American people want, and that is what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda... I know, because I won both of them... APPLAUSE MY My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I have had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this capital. To do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in working on it. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you will at least work with me where you do agree, and I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. Because I want this chamber, I want this city, to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings we are people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbours, whether it is down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child in every neighbourhood, your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances. As committed as we are to working... I want future is generations to know that we are people who see our differences as a great gift. That we value the dignity and worth of every citizen. Man and woman, young and old, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight. Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters. I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true. That we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states, that we are the United States of America. APPLAUSE ~ I want them to grow up in a country where a young mum can sit down and write a letter to President with a story that sums up these past six years. It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have too. We are a strong, tight-knit family, who has made it through some very hard times. My fellow Americans, we too are strong tight-knit family. We too have made it through some hard times. 15 years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation, a brighter future is ours to write. That begin this new chapter together, and let’s start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you. God bless this country we love. Thank you. President Barack Obama ending his sixth State of the Union address. And address it took almost exactly one hour. Pretty much in line with his others. He will now leave the chamber and his others. He will now leave the chamberand go chamber and go back to the right house as members of Congress who have been listening to this speech file back to their offices to hear from their constituents what they think of this address. I am joined byjohn Sopel. What are your first thoughts on this State of the Union? The President wanted to deliver two main messages. One of them is, here is my record. It is about economic renewal, and this idea that we have further to go for the middle class. I was struck after the totality of the speech at how much speech was about himself. He used I a lot, as well as the Wii of America. I think he wanted us to identify with him as a star on the campaign trail. You could hear at the end, that cheeky response to Republicans about winning two elections and knowing he has more of his presidency behind him, and still try to get the most out of the two years ahead. It was a very personal speech at the end. I thought it was like those concerts you go to offer rock and where they want to play their new album to you, and they play the first few tracks and you don’t quite know the jews, and you are listening hard. Then they say, we will play all rolled numbers. -- Then they say, we will play all rolled numbers. -- tunes. He used some of the campaign rhetoric, the United States of America, no red states and blue states, and some of thoseissues states and blue states, and some of those issues that he used so effectively, he was reminding Americans to look at that record of what he has done over the past five years. And you criticise something America is a better place than it was. It was a thumb in the eye to his critics and Republicans who have come into Washington after the mid-term elections thinking, we now have control of Congress. You can almost hear his speech writer saying, as he gave that litany of the economic achievements that have come during his term in office, saying, take that, Republicans. Look at what we have achieved, and counter that. Of course, there is a whole other narrative about stagnant wages for the middle class in America. This was a very confident resident making a confident speech at a time when people are questioning his ability to get anything done. Error democrats in that room, and some who were sent packing in November and sat and watched in their living rooms, who were wondering, where was this president when I was running? May you should have got that guy in my state, maybe I should have stood with that President in my state. I have covered UK politics for a long time, and aftera have covered UK politics for a long time, and after a defeat you see the politician broken, destroyed, finished. Barack Obama went into those mid-term elections. The Republicans have strengthened their grip on the House of Representatives, and they now have control of the Senate, and this man looks like he has renewed self-confidence, renewed belief in his policies, and renewed determination, in a way that was absent beforehand. Part of that is that he is free from campaigning. He doesn’t have another election to run. That frees him from Republicans and from the base of his party. I think whatjohn was hinting it also was that what we did here is a campaigning for history, right? I covered President Bill Clinton and George W Bush. President Obama is starting relatively early to talk about legacy, and build their history displays that we will see in his library someday. This is pretty early to be saying, here is my record. He has every reason to want to indicate that, that the economy is better than the US is ahead in the world in leadership and the US, and to rebuke Republicans in this divided government that he had this evening. Barack Obama is trained to say, this is the narrative we will have. I came in at the height of the financial crisis. Everything was doom and gloom. Look at the jobs we have created and the way the economy is growing. Growth figures are outstanding compared to the rest of the advanced industrial world. He is saying that they have done a huge amount in that time. The White House will look at how the US public receives this speech, which was more of a tone poem, less detail. We can go to Capitol Hill. Republican ombudsman, thank you forjoining us. What did you make of the President pars list of the achievements in the American economy? Undeniably looks good, doesn’t it? He is talking about an economy the people of Kansas don’t know -- congressmen. We are talking about a place, Wichita, that had 500 folks laid off. We have a country on more food stamps than everin a country on more food stamps than ever in the history of USA. More people not working than ever in American history. When a listen to his remarks tonight what I saw clearly was that he was disconnected from reality and from what the American people saw when they changed Congress in November. And especially when he spoke about national security. We have seen the terrorist acts and radical Islamic terrorism around the country over the past weeks. We have a president without a strategy and he didn’t talk about that tonight at all. He goes to Kansas later this week. What do you expect him to say to those who say they are not feeling the progress in the economy? I hope he will listen to them. I hope he will understand these are hard-working people. When he talks about more taxes, taking water out of the other person’s side of the bucket, I hope he listens to them. They want opportunity, not federal programmes and more big government that has failed the people of Kansas and the people of America. And I hope he will listen to people talking about national security. will listen to people talking about nationalsecurity. He national security. He spent a fair amount of time that in his set of remarks. We have had more terrorist incidents during his time of offers than ever in the history of the United States of America. America needs a strategy. The President is just leaving. Answer me this paradox, the statistics come out and show that unemployment has fallen and fallen sharply. They show that growth is rising and is very impressive, 6% in the last quarter. We have seen the drop in fuel prices. Are you really saying that the people that you represent are seeing none of that? The statistics you cited don’t reflect what’s really going on in America today. The unemployment rate has gone down because folks have dropped out of the labour force, because folks have dropped out of the labourforce, energy the labour force, energy prices have gone down not because of this President pars policies but in spite of them. This is not a president who understands what real America looks like and what it takes to create jobs and opportunities -- President pars policies. This President laid out half a dozen federal programmes, more spending and big government, that isn’t the right direction for our nation and won’t lead to thejobs direction for our nation and won’t lead to the jobs for ordinary working Americans that we need in Kansas and across the country. We have got Aleksei Symond here. Can you think of anything you heard in the speech, one do things that you think Congress will want to work with President Obama on in the coming year? -- Alexis. There is always something. He spoke a lot about trade. We will see enormous support for his efforts to make sure Americans have access to markets around the world. I hope his party willjoin us. They didn’t during his first six years in office. I hope with the Republicans in control of the upper house of the Senate we can achieve that. One thing to help middle-class people in Kansas as it would help Americans all over would be this idea of two years of free community college. What did you make of that proposal? Here is a president talking past what the reality on the ground is. He doesn’t understand that today we have these places that folks can go and find a place where they can afford to piece it together. We have programmes helping folks get into these schools and four the pay for them. When they get out of school they need opportunity. They need employers who want to bring jobs to it America, they need the opportunity to create wealth for themselves and their families, not have someone had them something, another two years, what they need are things that enable our economy to grow and that is where he has failed desperately in his first six years. Can you work with any of the tax reform proposals that he would like to introduce? If you are closing loopholes that only affect the top 1% of the country, isn’t it rather dangerous for the Republicans to be seen to be against the 99%? Republican policies are clear, lower tax rates for everyone, close loopholes, expand the base of folks are pay taxes. These are the policies of the Republican Party put forward for decades. I hope the presidentjoins us in this effort to simplify the tax code. The aim is quite simple, it is to create a place where people want to bring capital and job so we have the economic growth so that all citizens, the least amongst us most importantly, can get the firstjob, first up on the latter, that’s what our policies have done and that’s what we will work on -- President. I hope we can do tax reform in that way. President Obama is trying to link infrastructure, which is a boring word, the idea is roads and ports, to the idea of doing tax reform. He is linking them for a reason, a political reason. What do you think his marriage of those concepts will turn out to be? I don’t know. It was a very political speech, no doubt about it. I am happy to support the things that create the infrastructure in America. Tax reform, all of those things. They stand for the Conservative principles the people of Kansas understand work for the American people. We have a chance to get there and I hope the President would work with the house. I haven’t seen it in my six years to date but I always live in hope. Thank you for joining us on the programme. The President has left the chamber. It is emptying and they are dusting off the seats. He has gone to the White House. He will go to the residence and get hi-fi is from his wife and daughters and the rest of his team. -- high fives. I think they will be happy with this speech, seeing it as setting the mark and coming out from the White House and going to Congress saying, don’t count me out, I am still here, I am still relevant. Because of the mix of initiatives with what the White House wanted to be, very optimistic, focused on middle-class Americans, you are right, they will fill the president delivered it with a certain amount of gusto -- fill the president delivered it with a certain amount of gusto -- they will feel the President. a certain amount of gusto -- they will feelthe President. He seemed energised and relaxed facing the dominated house in the room. -- energised and relaxed facing the dominated house in the room. -- the Republican-dominated house. He filled the time with the aspirations that polls will tell you Americans share. These ideals are shared with him and these aspirations. He is almost challenging the Republicans to work with him in a way that they are going to be hard pressed to indicate, as you could hear from the congressmen plan, it isn’t that they are opposed to the ideas but they would like to do it differently. In a way he is bringing them into this discussion that he wants to have. Let’s talk about the things where we can agree. Americans are behind him on that concept, let’s the Washington work. We are waiting for the Republican response that will come from the newly elected senator from Iowa as we wait for her on the foreign policy side of things. On foreign policy? The Einstein quote, the definition of insanity is you keep doing the same thing again and again and expect different results. He got a lot of applause for that. Preserving the right to take action wherever America felt threatened by terrorists was a strong line is that you would expect him to restate. I also thought that with regards to cyber security, also thought that with regards to cybersecurity, I cyber security, I wonder how much bipartisan progress they can make. People have been taken aback byjust how vulnerable, notjust People have been taken aback byjust how vulnerable, not just the state is but private companies, Sony, you know, even banks likejP Morgan, all sorts of institutions have found themselves being hacked by a range of different people with a range of different motives and I wonder whether that is something you might see progress on. Fact checking on some of the lines he came out with on rolling back Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, I know that our correspondence who have been fair say that isn’t what they necessarily happening on the ground, that there is support for the moderate Syrian opposition isn’t going to work and he tried to put a positive spin on that though I don’t think that reflects what happens, it is happening.-- reflects what happens, it is happening. -- reflect what is adamant. He said this would take some time and it wasn’t going to be immediate. Look at the other battles that took place, it looked like it was going in reverse for a while. But equally, they have degraded, to some extent, but they haven’t taken control. On climate change he got to that on page nine of the 13 page speech and said that this is the most important issue facing future generations. I haven’t reached it until almost one hour into the speech. What more after the China agreement do you think the President can do over the next two years, very little I would have thought? He is going on a trip to India and there isa going on a trip to India and there is a discussion on the administration is having about all of the different initiatives that could possibly be hatched with countries that are major polluters and we know that India and China are that. We are watching forjoni Ernst, she is the Republican Senator. I amjoni Ernst. As a mother, a soldier and a newly elected senator for the great state of Iowa, I am proud to speak with you tonight. A few moments ago we heard the president layout his vision for the year to come. Even if we may not always agree, it is important to hear different points of view -- President. We appreciate the President sharing his. Tonight though, ratherthan the President sharing his. Tonight though, rather than respond to a speech, I would like to talk about your priorities. I would like to have a conversation about the new Republican Congress you have just elected. And how we plan to make Washington focus on your concerns again. We heard the message you sent in November, loud and clear, and now we are getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country. The new Republican Congress also understands how difficult these past six years have been. For many of us, the sting of the economy and the frustration with Washington’s dysfunction, warrant things we have two read about-- weren’t things. We felt them every day. -- to read. We felt them in the little town in Iowa where I grew up and am still proud to call home today. As a young girl I ploughed the field of our family farm, I word construction with my dad. To save for college, I worked the morning biscuit line at Hardy’s. We were raised to live simply, not to waste. It was a lesson my mother taught me every rainy morning. You see, growing up I had only one good peril shoes. So, on rainy schooldays, my mum would slip plastic bags over them to keep them dry -- pair of shoes. But I was never embarrassed because the school bus would be filled with rows and rows of young Iowans with bags slipped over their feet. Our parents might not have had much but they worked hard for what they did have. These days though, many families feel like they are working harder and harder with less and less to show for it. Notjust in red oak but across the country. We see our neighbours agonise over stagnant wages and lostjobs, we see the hurt caused by cancelled health-care plans and higher monthly insurance bills with the too many mums and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they will be able to leave to their children -- Red Oak. Americans have been hurting. When we demand solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare. It is a mindset that gave us a political talking point, not serious solutions. That’s why at the new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now we are working hard to pass the serious top creation ideas that you deserve. One you have probably heard about is the Keystonejobs Bill. Obama has delayed its bipartisan infrastructure project for years. Even though many members of his party, unions and a strong majority of Americans support it, the President’s own State Department said keystone’s construction could prevent thousands of jobs said keystone’s construction could prevent thousands ofjobs and pump billions into our economy and do it with minimal environ mental impact. We work with Democrats to pass this through the house and we are doing that in the Senate -- environmental. President Obama will soon have a decision to make, will he signed the bill or will he block good, American jobs? There is a lot we can achieve if we work together. Let’s tear down trade barriers in places like Europe and the Pacific. Let’s sell more of what we make and grow in America over there so we can boost manufacturing, wages and jobs right here at home. Let’s simplify America’s outdated and loophole ridden tax code. Republicans think tax filing should be easier for you, notjust tax filing should be easier for you, not just of the well-connected. tax filing should be easier for you, notjust of the well-connected. So, let iron out loopholes to lower rates and create jobs, let iron out loopholes to lower rates and createjobs, not rates and create jobs, not pay for more government spending. That President has already expressed some support for these kinds of ideas -- the. We are calling on him now to co-operate to pass them. You will see a lot of serious work in this new Congress. Some of it will occur where I stand tonight, in the armed services committee room. This is where I willjoin committee colleagues, Republicans and Democrats colleagues, Republicans and Democrats to discuss ways to support our exceptional military and its mission. This is where we will debate strategies to confront terrorism and the threats posed by Al-Qaeda, ISIL and those radicalised hy Al-Qaeda, ISIL and those radicalised by them. We know that threats like these cannot be wished away. We have been reminded of the reach of terrorism at home and abroad, most recently in France and Nigeria. And also in places like Canada and Australia. Our hearts go out to the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones. We can only imagine the depth of their grief. For two decades, I’ve proudly worn the nation ‘s uniform, today, as a lieu tenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard, deployed overseas with some of America’s finest men and women, I’ve seenjust how of America’s finest men and women, I’ve seen just how dangerous these kind of threats can be. The forces of violence and oppression don’t care about the innocent. We need a comprehensive plan to defeat them. We must also honour America’s veterans, these men and women have sacrificed so much in defence of our freedom, and our way of life. They deserve nothing less than the benefits they were promised. And quality of care that we can all be proud of. These are important issues, the new Congress to address. We will keep fighting to repeal and replace a healthcare law that has hurt so many hard-working families. We will work to correct executive overreach. We will propose ideas that aim to cut wasteful spending and balance the budget. With meaningful reforms, not higher taxes, like the president has proposed. We will advance solutions to prevent the kind of cyber attacks we have seen recently. We will work to confront Iran ‘s nuclear ambitions. And, we will defend life, because protecting our most vulnerable is an important measure of any society. Congress is back to work on your behalf, ready to make Washington focus on your concerns again. We know America faces big challenges, but history has shown there is nothing our nation and our people cannot accomplish, just look at my parents and grandparents. They had very little to call their own, except the sweat on their brow, and the dirt on their hands. But, they worked, they sacrificed, and they dream big dreams for their children and grandchildren. And because they did, and ordinary Iowan like me has had some truly extraordinary opportunities -- dreams. Because they showed me that you do not need to come from wealth or privilege to make a difference -- dreamed. You just need the freedom to dream big and a whole lot of hard work. The new Republican Congress you were elected is working to make Washington understand that as well. With a little cooperation from the president, we can get Washington working again. Thank you for allowing me to speak with you tonight. May God bless this great country of ours, the brave Americans serving in uniform on our behalf, and you, the hard-working men and women who make the United States of America the greatest nation the world ever known. There we have said tojoni Ernst, the newly elected Republican senator from Iowa, giving the Republican response to President Obama ‘s State of the Union Address, saying Congress is back to work on your behalf. We will keep fighting to repeal and replace the healthcare law that has hurt so many hard-working families, and she gave her own story as well. Let’s go back to Capitol Hill, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, Senator, let me pick up on something that joni Ernst was talking about there, and Mike Pompeii of Kansas raised the same point earlier. Basically, the list of economic achievements that the president laid out, the booming stock market, economic growth figures, decline in unemployment, they look good as a list, but the problem is to many ordinary Americans are still not feeling the impact of those improvements? I think in terms of the list, it’s important to do that, I think folks on both parties have a tendency to forget how far we have come. When the President began in 2009, we were losing 715,000 jobs or more in each and every month. Month after month after month. There is no strategy for him to be dealing with that now. Now, we see growth, 10 million more private sectorjobs. The numbers matter. But we still have a way to go. Because of the wage problem. There’s a disconnect between a growing economy, which used to mean a rise in wages has not happened to the extent it should. I agree that we still have some way to go to address the wage issue, and middle-class families. That is why the president spoke at length to -- tonight. And has done since his presidency started. Focusing on the middle-class. That’s a priority on both sides. Wages have been stagnant in America since the year 2000. Americans have not had a wage rise. They spoke about middle-class economics tonight at length. The course seems to be that basically, giving middle-class Americans tax breaks, particularly in the fields of education and childcare, and paying for those with a tax hike on the wealthiest 1%, it’s never going to fly. Republicans will not agree to that. Was it more than political posturing on the president ‘s behalf? I don’t believe so. What we have to do is begin a conversation and engage. When you going to discuss or debate or negotiate, you don’t surrender all of your ideas to begin with. I think a lot of Republicans who have been reacting to what the president said long before today had a categorical condemnation of everything that he said. I would condemnation of everything that he said. Iwould hope said. I would hope that even if they disagree a lot, maybe they have better ways of reaching a middle-class. Some of the rhetoric here and capital Hill, one of the things we did, that I would favour again, is reducing the payroll tax, at least temporarily -- Capitol Hill. Make the folks in the top 1% PGY Hill. Make the folks in the top 1% pay a bit more to help the middle. There are a lot of ways to do this. It will take a commitment, first of all, to do something meaningfulfor the middle-class, and secondly have that kind of bipartisan consensus. When you mention the middle wage, I’m he did, that is probably a ladder up to the middle-class. -- I’m glad he did. There are a series of things he can do, tax credits for businesses hiring to make things more certain. There’s a lot of stuff we can do together to make it a partisan stand-off. Traditionally, partisan sta nd-off. Traditionally, the partisan stand-off. Traditionally, the president comes together for the Congress State of the Union Address, he lists the things that he wants to do, and he gets a few done. If you can point to one thing that you think the president can do in tonight ‘s address that the Republicans will co-operate with, what will that be? If you are talking about what they, the Republicans, can most easily work together with them with, an area with potential is infrastructure. Both parties need to reinvest and rebuild bridges, sewage, there is a lot of technological capability. But thatis lot of technological capability. But that is an area where I have found Republican senators talk to them about an area where we can work together. They have the majority now. Maybe they can work more than when they were in an opposition mindset or predisposition. Thank you forjoining me, Senator. Thank you. During the State of the Union Address, he raised foreign policy issues as well, and the president pointed to Cuba and the change of policy on Cuba, bringing an end to the long embargo. This is what he had to say. In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past the expiration date. (APPLAUSE). What you are doing does not work for 50 years, so it is time to try something new. -- when what you are doing. The shift in the Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere. It removes a phoney excuse for restrictions in Cuba. It stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. This year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. President Obama there with a message of if it is broken, fix it, on Cuban policy, which he says he has done. In Havana, our correspondent is there. Were they watching the president ‘s speech there this evening? Some people would have been watching it, but it wasn’t anything like the kind of event when the president here, Raul Castro, made the announcements about the agreement last month. He appeared in -- on national television last month, church bells peeled, people in the streets were leaping with euphoria. This was not as big a thing for the Cubans. It was very much and America focused speech. It’s the first time a president has called for lifting the embargo on Cuba in the State of the Union Address, that is something that will be noted here, and strongly supported. Basically, Cubans will have responded to this speech like they have the policy in general. Ordinary Cubans want the embargo lifted, they want the easing restrictions on trade that is being promised. They want the Internet, all of these things, but they are hoping for. President Castro has welcomed the move, and spoken highly of President Obama and his initiative. But he’s made it clear that he does not want or expect that this will mean that Cuba has to change the political system. On those grounds, anything is up to be discussed. There are a lot of questions about how this will transpire. But there are appropriate steps that will take place. The highest level talks yet on re-establishing those relationships, they will begin tomorrow. Things are looking forward even as President Obama is again announcing a Cuban policy in his speech. Moving fast pretty quickly with the State Department talks, Barbara. The one thing that Washington is also saying clearly is that there was a quid pro quo here, and we have lifted the embargo. We also ask for political reforms and the release of 53 political prisoners. They say that they have got those prisoners out. How much has that been covered in Havana? Not nearly as much as the United States, that is something that critics of the policy pressed the administration in Washington on very much. Critics said that Cuba and the Castro regime got something for nothing, but they did not really have to respond. This was a kind of test case that critics held up to the administration. The prisoners have been released. It is something the State Department has made quite clear, that they are in a process of re-establishing diplomatic relations, they say it is not a reward, to have normal relationships with other countries. It is something they are doing with their own interests, and something that would benefit the Cuban people. Human rights, political prisoners, they will keep being raised, but they are not conditions. Cubans want freedom, they want prisoners released, but the main thing that people here are living with is an economy that is taking... They are living on incomes that are $20 a month, and are seeing the rest of the world connected to the Internet, theirs is very limited and restricted. They want to join the modern world. Their focus restricted. They want to join the modern world. Theirfocus has been on what they hope this new policy will mean to their lives. Let us go back to the President’s speech and to the Republican response. Thank you forjoining me. We have not had a chance to speak since the Republican response to the state of the union address. From what we heard, some sense of what the Republican response is. It does not seem to be, right, we are willing to co-operate, especially with the tax issue. No. This is a really tough thing to do. It is a new, freshman senator with this job. It is interesting how a woman was chosen who was not in the leadership to do something she is not used to doing. She did a finejob. The content of what she was saying, with all the smiles she gave, were very much laying down some remark -- markers for the Republicans. They had ideas of how they would like to fulfil those ideas. Whether it was not spending the money he would like to spend on making sure the taxes are simpler. Certainly not raised. Mentioning abortion, President Obama issued a veto threat on a house Republican bill. You can see the clashes were in her text. And talking about fighting to repeal and replace the healthcare law. She made no apologies for the idea. She spoke about how people in the midwest deal that Obamacare is something that should be repealed and replaced. She did not talk about fixing it, she talked about pulling it out. She served as a member of the national guard. She has also served in Iraq. Resident Obama spoke about security concerns facing America and its allies. In Iraq, in Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISIS’s advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition to degrade and destroyed this threat. -- WE BFE we are also trying to assist people everywhere to stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on the Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission are passing a resolution to authorise the use of force against ISIS. Where are we with Congress and funding the effort against ISIS? The Congress is going to have to make some decisions. There is no indication on the Senate or house side that they want to challenge the President on the funding element. You can see the fight is about how to approach of the Islamic State so you havejohn McCain, who will now be the chairman of the most important committee. Finally the job he of the most important committee. Finally thejob he has Finally the job he has always wanted, other than President. And his close ally, Lindsey Graham, they are talking about a real muscular arming of the Syrian rebels. They have said we cannot win against the Islamic State without boots on the ground. What they mean, they are talking about being able to place intelligence and targeting troops on the ground. We are going to be talking for the rest of 2015 about how the war against Islamic state shall be prosecuted. The President has made a hash of it, according to the Republicans. Not delivering what he has described as a real successes. How much support is there in the Republican party for prosecuting that? The President asked Congress to vote on a resolution. We will see that debate. There has been a desire on the part of Democrats and Republicans to have that debate, even though we are well into the campaign against Islamic state. The President asked to go into that debate. We will see all the elements, the funding, the chairman of the new Senate committee leadership trying to talk about how the war should be prosecuted, and it will be one of the most animated debates this year. Going back to Capitol Hill. We have a congressman, a Democrat from Virginia. How did it feel to be listening to President Obama’s speech tonight, knowing the Democrats are in the minority in the House of Representatives and in the Senate? That was deeply embedded in the speech. Here they -- key put out a positive vision on what we need to make America Strong. He did it in a non-partisan way. He asked Republicans to work with him. We have been speaking to members of the other party, the Republican party, during this evening, since the State of the union address. They made it clear that they do not think their constituents feel the economic recovery the President outlined. What about your constituents in Virginia? Do they feel what the President has said, that the economy has improved? Both things aren’t true. -- are true. We have added morejobs than all the true. -- are true. We have added more jobs than all the other advanced nations of the world. We also know that incomes have not recovered for many middle income families. The President acknowledged that, which is why it he wants to do things like the child tax credit or making the first two years of couege making the first two years of college free. Things that will make middle income families feel like they are sharing prosperity. What do you think, out of the wish list President Obama presented tonight to Congress and the American people, what is actually going to happen? I am not asking what you would like to see happen, Iam am not asking what you would like to see happen, I am asking you what you think Democrats and Republicans can co-operate enough on? The President said anything that is hard will take some time. But it is worth doing. If we were to come back in ten years, everything we talked about it. In the next two years, we can get an infrastructure bill, we can make community college free for the first two years. We can get that child tax credit lined up. We can make progress on a non-partisan approach to global warming and the environment. In a way that does not interfere with religious beliefs. Something that talks about the facts. Your Republican colleagues would say all of that sounds great, but we want to do it in different ways. The idea of some kind of middle-class tax break is funded by a tax hike on the wealthy, they will not buy it. Right now, for example, the President’s notion of getting rid of the trust fund loophole affects such a small percentage of Americans. Maybe 0.25%. Especially since every Republican I have talked to is interested in boosting the incomes of the middle class. I am more optimistic. Thank you very much forjoining me. The Democrats do seem to think they can work with Republicans on something. Are we underselling the President’s desires? They are so hopeful because both chambers are in the minority in ways they have not experienced before. They will have to find their way. One of the things that would be worth talking to lawmakers about his one of the things since I have covered President Obama, even when he was in the Senate, the speeches are great, then the follow-through can fall apart. He needs may be more initiatives to actually be brought in and hold together, rather than just at the time of the speech. That is not something he has done in the past? I think because he is facing Republican majorities, he will be pressed and have to do that more. To sit down with some of his opponents. You can see looking around at the speech that some of those Republicans were not applauding. He will have to bring them to the White House, sit down and talk to them. Thank you very much forjoining me. Spending another state of the union with me. We will be back next year when it will be President Obama’s last state of the union. It was his sixth state of the union address. He spoke about middle-class economics, making that’s the mantra of his last two years, with a challenge to the Republican Party. That has been a BBC News special. The advice is to stay tuned to the weather forecasts through tomorrow morning because we have some snow in one or two places. We don’t have widespread snow and most of us won’t get it. If you live in eastern parts of Wales, the Midlands, northern England, hit and miss areas will get a good covering, maybe 2-5 centimetres. These clouds are just floating around with an area of low pressure. You can get a clear message of where most of the snow will fall. That is eastern Wales, parts of the Midlands into northern England. Maybe more across the hills. To the south of that, we are talking about rain. We might get a bit of snow mixing in. For Northern Ireland and the south-west of Scotland through the lower areas, some wintry weather first thing in the morning. Wherever you are, it will be a cold morning. There will be some good weather around the course of Wednesday. The best place to be is eastern Scotland. Possibly the north of England. It will be barely above freezing. For the rest of us, it is a grey day with a bit of rain and sleet. Then on Thursday it dries out. It will be misty and possibly frosty once again. A bit of sunshine in the afternoon. It is still cold. On Thursday, with. to SEE SOITIE Ci’I8I’IgâS. From the Atlantic, a cushion of milder air will wash away the cold. These mild Atlantic winds will bring some weather fronts as well. We will be mostly talking about rain and less cold conditions coming in. Looking a little bit less cold. If you are travelling across Europe in the next few days, it is more or less the same. However, in the US some nice warm weather. ~ Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US, and around the globe. I’m Mike Embley. Our top stories: In his annual State of the Union speech, President Obama has said the US is 'ready to turn the page’ after fifteen years of war and recession. America for all that we have endured, for the grit and hard work required to come back. For all of the tasks that lie ahead, know this. The shadow of crisis has passed. And the State of the Union Address strong. -- and the State of the Union Address is strong. The japanese government tells the BBC it has known for several months that two citizens were being held hostage by Islamist militants. In Yemen, a group of Shi’ite rebels has stormed the Presidential palace, it’s not clear who’s really in charge. In his last-but-one State of the Union address to Congress, the sixth of his presidency, Barack Obama has declared the United States is turning the page after years of war and recession. He was speaking to a Congress controlled by Republicans for the first time in his presidency, no doubt the reason so much of his speech had been trailed beforehand, on social media. He threw out a challenge to Republicans with a call for higher taxes on the wealthy, to pay for a better deal for the middle class and small businesses. He was upbeat about the rapidly recovering economy, clearly with an eye to the presidential election in 2016. He urged Congress to help end the embargo on Cuba, authorise military strikes against the jihadists who call themselves Islamic State, and said he would veto any attempt by Congress to impose new sanctions on Iran. This was presented as a ""good news"" speech, and the president insisted the outlook was positive. We are 15 years into this new century. 15 years into the dawn of terror touching our shores. That unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars. It’s all vicious recession spread across our nation. And the world. -- too. It still was, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough yearfor turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy breakthrough yearfor America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. The route to prosperity was ""middle class economics,"" President Obama said - the idea that the country does best when everyone gets their fair shot. But he said, there were obstacles. So... So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics doesn’t get in the way. We cannot slow down businesses, all put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or physical shutdowns. We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance. We are unravelling the new rules on Wall Street, refighting past battles on immigration we forgot to fix them. A broken system. If a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it. It will have earned my veto. Let’s explore this a little more. Katty Kay is in Washington. You decide -- Katty Kay is in Washington. You decide -- described this as a thumb in the eye for Republicans. He was confident president bearing in mind if was thinking what he was going to do for the next two years? There’s been so much speculation about the fact that President Obama can do anything in his last two years, he is a lame duck president. You could almost hear the White House speechwriter ‘s thinking to themselves, take that Republicans! As they came up with an undeniable list of America’s economic progress at the moment. Growth is up, the stock market is down, all of those things that Barack Obama says are as a result of his policies over the last few years are now working. The problem is that too many Americans still don’t feel that. The Republicans I’ve spoken to since Barack Obama gave that State of the Union Address has said that is not the America that our constituents know. Our constituents know of an America where it is too hard for people to get a job, and when they get one, wages are too low. That is what he has to change if he is really going to leave the White House as the man who turned round the American economy. It is clear the Republicans don’t want to pay for tax breaks with tax hikes. Do you see anything here that, actually, the president can work with Congress in the next two years or so? Yes, Ithink with Congress in the next two years or so? Yes, I think there are a couple of things that were mentioned in this speech. Trade is clear the Republicans don’t want to pay for tax breaks with tax hikes. Do you see anything here that, actually, the president can work with Congress in the next two years or so? Yes, I think there are a couple of things that were mentioned in this speech. Traders warned that the another is that a couple of Democrats have mentioned to me in -- since this speech, infrastructure spending, that will boost job speech, infrastructure spending, that will boostjob growth, infrastructure is in a shocking condition, in American airports, you think you were in a developing country compared to other countries around the world. That has to be improved. Again, you have to question as to whether they will be prepared to spend the money -- prepared. At the end, they described it as the United States, and he mentioned several times during the course of the speech, he will veto things that come to his desk that he does not lie, and the battle lines are clearly drawn between the president and the Republican Congress. It has been a long night, we will let you go. Thank you. The president also spoke about the security challenges facing America and its allies, especially in the Middle East. In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping the ISIL advance. Instead, we are getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a coalition to degrade and destroy ultimately the terrorist group. We are also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere. Who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. Tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission, by passing a resolution to authorise the use of force against ISIL. Speaking of course to a now-entirely-Republican Congress, the President appealed for a less partisan approach to politics. He said that was what the American people wanted. ~ I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda... (LAUGHTER). (APPLAUSE). I know because I want both of them! -- won. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE). My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I have had since the day I swore an oath on the steps here. To do what I believe is best for America. If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me again. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you will at least work with the way you do agree. I committed every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. (APPLAUSE). Our correspondent Gary O’Donoghue is on Capitol Hill for us. Picking up that point that the president made, he made it very clear, I have no other campaign to one foot -- clear, I have no other campaign to one foot -- to run. In one sense, he is free from the Republicans, also his own party base. He’s already trying to play to history, isn’t he? To his own record? He is, it is the flipside of the lame-duck presidency, isn’t it? Look, I’ve got a bit of freedom, I can do what I want, so what I like, take you on if I don’t like what you are proposing, I will start a veto on it. Yes, you sounded a bit liberated, I thought, in that passage in particular. There was serious business being done here as well, he was offering up chances for the Republicans to work with him, especially on things like trade and trade agreements for the Pacific West, and in that used, changes to the tax code, the Republicans might be able to agree with too. There were glimmers. On the wider foreign policy stage, you saw a holding pattern. There was big movement on the story of Cuba, asking Congress to begin the work of lifting the embargo. In -- that will continue as is. On balance, it might not be remembered for long, but what you are seeing over the next couple of years is a battle between him, Pennsylvania Avenue, Congress at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, trying to betray themselves as doing the right thing for America, and be constructive in the face of one position to the other. Whether you like the president ‘s politics or not, there was a renewed self-confidence and determination about the man, what was the feeling among the people there on Capitol Hill that you have been speaking to? There must have been Democrats wishing they had a version of the President in that last campaign? Many Democrats did not want to see Barack Obama at all in the last campaign, in November. Many wanted to stay as far away from him as possible. Bearing in mind as the economy picks up, and it has done, there is great here, and implement is falling, numbers are starting to look at. Barack Obama ‘s own personality and approval-- approval ratings have bounced back. They’ve improved significantly in the last month. There’s a new gloss to him. Something the Republican Congress here will try to knock off pretty quickly, that shine. There’s a new balance and flair, if you like. As we said before, a sense of release and being, not only unshackled by the weight of trying to get re-elected, at the base of your own party, but also the ability to look back and say, I’ve done some of the things I want to do, healthcare is a big thing. It would be difficult to unravel any meaningful way -- in any meaningful way. There are a couple more things I want to do. If you help me, we can do it. Otherwise, he can look forward to the next election, and lay the ground for a Democrat to replace him in the White House. Thank you. Megan Murphy is Washington Bureau Chief with the Financial Times. She joins us from Washington now. Good to talk to you, thanks for your time. It is difficult for Republicans, isn’t it, at a time when Congress as a whole is so unpopular, to argue against policies that are very explicitly aimed at improving the lives of the middle-class. Struggling, working families, helping small businesses. It will look good? It is very difficult. Particularly, Ithink It will look good? It is very difficult. Particularly, I think the president was incredibly clever tonight in how he used his rhetoric. He outlined these far reaching policies on Saturday about hiking taxes on America’s wealthiest, and imposing another bank levy that would raise a total of more than 300 billion. If you read between the lines tonight, he did not even explicitly mention either of those two policies. Instead, he focused on broader rhetoric, like the middle-class, boosting minimum wage, including consensus for childcare. Women calling again for legislation that would mandate equal pay for equal work. that would mandate equal pay for equalwork. He equal work. He did not go out there with aggressive in equality agendas that some thought he might. That one wing of the party has pushed for. He tempered his language, and did not really go out there to bash. It was a different kind of speech, focused on a narrative aimed squarely at the middle-class. Looking at this from the outside, there’s an odd thing about tax laws, isn’t there? They favour the very rich, the 1%. Many Americans hold to the stream that they become wealthy themselves. They don’t mind so much having these laws that seem so unequal? -- hope this dream. Inequality in America is always very interesting, you would think, in a society where we see incomes at the top have record gaps compared to those at the bottom, there would be greater pushes for redistribution in the tax system. Generally, you would find only 60% -- 50% of American support that. Obama has been clever ad targeting loopholes in the tax code that also disproportionately stacked in favour of the welfare -- wealthy. -- act targeting. Essentially, a brake on inheriting and passing down investment assets, that only benefits a tiny majority of the superrich, 90% of the benefit of that policy goes to the ultra- wealthy in America -- break. These are loopholes that have existed for a long time in America. Actually, they have flown under the radar. That is largely because people are not rich enough to benefit from it. However clever he may have been politically, the Republicans don’t have to help him at all? What chance do you see as much being accomplished before the election in 2016? I see not a lot. Before this progressive agenda that the president has laid out, he touched on areas of common ground, infrastructure, trade, and some corporate tax reform. You only have to listen to the opposition tonight. jody Ernst was talking about a keystone, and whether he would approve it. He said he would veto keystone, he said it before, and outlined to further proposals today that he would veto. -- jodi. I fear that even though he has laid out this agenda tonight, in a family friendly way, especially in a middle-class family friendly way, that the chance of getting this decision three is limited, and we have to see if Republicans are going to seize the initiative to govern now, and say, he’s laid out his policies, we will lay out hours. Much more to come on BBC News. Including this. How Chinese engineers turned a 22,000 tons of suspension bridge into position. First though the stories making newspaper headlines around the world. South China Morning Post reports that China’s economic growth, although slowing, is still creating enough jobs to let the government focus on long term reforms. China Daily has news of a crackdown on apparently corrupt officials who transfer money abroad through casinos in Macau. France and Germany have joined the UK in demanding that American tech firms do more to police terrorism-related content, or face new laws forcing them to do so. That’s in the Wall Street journal. Britain’s six-year inquiry into the Iraq War will not be published before the general election in May, angering many who say it should have been put before voters long ago. the Guardian has the story .And the Times reports that for some women, having their partner present during childbirth is not a soothing influence but seems to worsen the pain. About 95% of British fathers are now in the delivery room when their child is born. This is BBC News. I’m Mike Embley. The latest headlines. President Obama has set out an upbeat vision of the United States in his State of the Union address. He told Congress the country is 'ready to turn the page’ after 15 years of war and recession. japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has condemned a threat by Islamic State militants to kill two japanese hostages. An online video purportedly from the group shows a masked gunman threatening the lives of two men unless a ransom of $200 million is paid. Mr Abe has vowed to save the hostages, saying the world will not give in to terrorism. Our correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes has more. This man is a well-known freelance japanese filmmaker. He was last seen crossing the border from Turkey and Syria last October. He was believed to be on his way to interview members of the Islamic State. This man is a self-styled military contract. Some have called him a fantasist or water rest. Videos on his website show him in northern Syria, dressed in combat fatigues, carrying an assault rifle. The threat to kill these men is clearly designed to scare japanese people and turned them against any involvement in the fight against Islamic State. In a statement, it the demand to 100 million dollars for the japanese men. That is the same figure pledged by Shinzo Abe in non-military aid for countries that are fighting against Islamic state. The japanese government has made it clear it will not give in to terror and chronic trip to jerusalem, Shinzo Abe it angrily rejected the demand. TRANSLATION: This is unforgivable and Ifeel a demand. TRANSLATION: This is unforgivable and I feel a strong resentment. I strongly demand that they do not hurt the japanese citizens and immediately released them. According to Western analysts, the video is designed to create fear in people against in all countries against Islamic state. They really tried to get audience to turn against the government ‘s and force the government ‘s two stay out of the Middle East. To withdraw their support for participation in the military action in the region. The video has been running all day in japanese terror -- video has been running all day in japanese terror -- television. I have seen the pictures on the news. The fact it has reached japan is really scary. Other countries, including France and Italy, are reported to have paid large ransoms. Though both have denied it. In the past, japan has handed over large sums of money to get people back. This time it is different. The amount of money being demanded is so vast. More importantly, these men went to Syria willingly, knowing the situation. That is likely to mute public demands to get them back. There is a lot of confusion in Yemen after a group of Shi’ite rebels stormed the Presidential palace in the capital Sana’a. After fighting security forces the Houthi rebel leader went on television to demand cooperation from the President. It isn’t clear who’s really in charge. Nor what happens next in a country where Al-Qaeda operatives appear to be regaining strength. The BBC’s Sebastian Usher has more on the unfolding situation. On hillsides around Sana’a, Shia rebels have reinforced their grip on the capital. They took control of the presidential palace complex in the south of the city, further weakening the remaining military. The Houthi launched their most direct and dangerous attack on the President’s authority as they shelled his private home in the city. He was reported to be inside. just an hour or two later, the Houthi leader gave a speech on live television. It was full of accusations against the presidential government failing to implement peace deals and reforms. The Houthi themselves have failed to abide by a key element of the peace deal. That they should completely withdraw from the capital and return to their northern stronghold. Instead, the last two days of heavy fighting have only seen the group tightened its grip on Sana’a. Some in the capital have expressed their frustration. TRANSLATION: This attack on a civilian area, this is an awful development, especially a street that is normally full of housing and people. This is very unfortunate. Negotiations have failed to restore calm and stability. The peace deal up right now is the plan backed by the President for a new federation in Yemen. But the Houthi want to return to simple division between north and south. Allowing them to maintain the gains they have made. They are trying to ensure that their demands are met. But how far they are prepared to go and where remains unclear. Staying with Yemen, two Yemeni nationals have been charged in a New York court with conspiring to kill Americans abroad. Saddiq Al-Abbadi and Ali Alvi allegedly took part in attacks on US forces in Afghanistan in 2008. If convicted, they could face life in prison. An Austrian university trying to identify incinerated remains found in Mexico says it has not found enough usable DNA to match that of the 42 students missing since September. Experts have so far identified the remains ofjust one of the trainee teachers believed to have been murdered after a protest in the south-western city of Iguala. The Colima volcano in Western Mexico has erupted sending a column of ash thousands of metres into the air. Dramatic time lapse video shows the moment the volcano, also known as the Fire Volcano, exploded sending a large cloud of ash into the air. The volcano is about 700 kilometres northwest of Mexico city. The Colima volcano is one of the most active and potentially destructive volcanoes in Mexico Some amazing pictures of a huge and tricky construction project in China, where this bridge was swung through more than 90 degrees, to meet up with the roads which will eventually cross over it. The bridge will be almost two kilometres long when completed and weighs 22,400 tons, the heaviest in the world. It’s being built in Zoucheng City in Shandong Province and it tookjust under two hours to swing all the way round. If all goes to plan, it will open for traffic in March. Finally, dancing robots, Here they are. Created by engineers at two to university. Each one is just one kilogram, 35 centimetres and cost $1500 to produce. You get a synchronised dance routine. There is a lot of gesturing, but not much footwork. The designer said he wanted to see if he could mass-produce robots with the ability to perform together. The routine seems to have pretty much proved he could. A reminder of our top story. Resident Obama has set out on up the division of the United States in the state of the union. He highlighted recent economic success and a challenge Republicans to support moves to modernise the country’s infrastructure. America for all that we have and you would, all of the hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, no this, the shadow of crisis has passed and the state of the union is strong. Much more on that and all the news on the BBC website. You can reach me and most of the team on Twitter. Thank you for watching. The advice is to keep track of the weather forecasts through tomorrow morning because we have some snow in one or two places. We are not talking about widespread snow. But in one or two places there could be a significant covering, maybe five centimetres in a couple of places. Stay tuned to your local radio updates. It is a very volatile situation that keeps changing. It is not a coherent area of snow or rain. It is very hit and miss. These clouds are just floating around with an area of low pressure. You can get a clear message of where most of the snow will fall. That is eastern Wales, parts of the Midlands into northern England. Maybe more across the hills. To the south of that, we are talking about rain. We might get a bit of snow mixing in. For Northern Ireland and the south-west of Scotland through the lower areas, some wintry weather first thing in the morning. Wherever you are, it will be a cold morning. There will be some good weather around the course of Wednesday. The best place to be is eastern Scotland. Possibly the north of England. It will be barely above freezing. For the rest of us, it is a grey day with a bit of rain and sleet. Then on Thursday it dries out. It will be misty and possibly frosty once again. A bit of sunshine in the afternoon. It is still cold. On Thursday, we are going to start to see some changes. For the rest of us, it is a grey day with a bit of rain and sleet. Then on Thursday it dries out. It will be misty and possibly frosty once again. A bit of sunshine in the afternoon. It is still cold. On Thursday, we are going to start to see some changes. From the Atlantic, a cushion of milder air will wash away the cold. These mild Atlantic winds will bring some weather fronts as well. We will be mostly talking about rain and less cold conditions coming in. Looking a little bit less cold. If you are travelling across Europe in the next few days, it is more or less the same. However, in the US some nice warm weather. ~ The latest headlines from BBC News, I’m Mike Embley. In his sixth annual State of the Union address, President Obama has said the US is turning the page after years of ""vicious recession"" and war, with the economy creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. He called on Congress to pass a plan to boost job creation by upgrading the country’s physical infrastructure. President Obama called on Congress to pass a resolution that authorises the use of force against Islamic State. He said the US was leading a broad coalition that would ultimately defeat the organisation but warned the process would take time. He also called on Congress to work towards ending the trade embargo on Cuba. The leader of the Shia rebel movement in Yemen has said that the country is at a critical and defining moment. He was speaking just hours after his followers shelled the president’s home in the capital, Sanaa, and seized control of the presidential palace. The UN Security Council has condemned the attack. Now, it’s time for HardTalk. Welcome to a special edition of HARDtalk, I am Stephen Sackur. Today, the BBC is running a series of programmes about democracy - the idea, and the reality. It’s a theme my guest today has had reason to consider in great depth. Wu’er Kaixi was one of the leaders of the Tiananmen Square student protests in Beijing in 1989. He became one of the Chinese government’s most wanted men. He escaped, and now lives in exile in Taiwan. Today, he joins me and the HARDtalk audience here in London. (APPLAUSE). Wu’er Kaixi, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you very much, we could use more platforms like this to voice our ideas. Well, I want to talk to you all about your ideas. I want to begin by taking you back to 1989. You made a stand as a student leader for freedom, and for democracy. Looking back at it now, it has cost you your life. As you knew it then, in 1989. On a personal level, do you have any regrets? Well, I survived in a great movement that I am proud to be part of. It ended up as a massacre. Regret can sometimes be an understatement. I don’t think I have done anything wrong. And then I am very proud to be a part of that historical event. But if you ask me the question the other way, if you ask, do I want to do it again? The answer would be very hesitant, because of the outcome and result. It was nothing we anticipated. That was what I was driving at. If you had a crystal ball and could have seen into the future, and what would happen to yourself and your country after 1989, would you have made the decision to go on hunger strike, to be one of the leaders, going onto stages and demanding of the ruling party that they change and deliver a democratic vision? Or, if you could see into the future, would you have thought it was not worth it? The logic of all mass movements throughout history have always been like when people have a dissatisfaction, they come together. They expressed their voices, try to apply pressure to the opponent, to the government, and the ruling party. And hoping that they can take the better option. Knowing there could always be some worse options that they take. In China, that has often been the case. But how bad it can be, we did not anticipate the massacre, bringing tanks, hundreds of thousands of troops. On my personal account, yes, we paid a great price. I have not been able to see my parents, my family, for the last 25 or 26 years. It’s a great price to pay. But my price does not compare with those who lost their lives, on that night. And the hundreds, if not thousands of them. Let’s go back to those days of May and june 1989, and we will look forward to where China is today and where it is going. Let’s go to ‘89. This is an interesting thought I had. You were using the word ""democracy"" at the time. You were the child of a 1-party state. You were brought up in the country created by Chairman Mao. How did you know what democracy was? The Communist Party never really denied a term of democracy. Infact, the word ""democracy"" in Chinese translates literally in English as ""people rule"". That’s a great idea, people rule. And the Communist Party said, this is democracy. Didn’t Mao call it the People’s Democratic dictatorship? Yes. To be totally honest, yes, we do not know much about democracy, other than the face value the term. Other than some glimpse we have had in the last ten years before 1989, for ten years, we would look at the West. The real driving force that brought us to the street in Beijing in 1989 was not so much our deep knowledge of democracy, but our deep knowledge of lack of democracy. We know what it is, when we don’t have democracy. You were from a relatively privileged background, you were a guy who had the chance of a higher education, at a Beijing University. Beijing Normal, excuse me. Yes, in a way, I’m surprised that you were prepared to risk everything, back in 1989, because there must have been a lot of fear. You knew the party would not easily accept what you were saying? Again, we wanted to apply pressure so that hopefully they can take the better option. Yes, we were privileged. All university students in China in 1989 will somehow be considered privileged, because the college examination entrance rate is insanely low. Something like... 1%. And then, those of us who made it, we are almost guaranteed a position in society, but guaranteed by someone else. Never by ourselves. We did not want our life to be managed, to be handled, to be designed by someone else. After Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1979, ten years, he introduced the ideas of reform and openness. He didn’t really open China in 1989, he didn’t open the door of China in 1989, he opened the window. See through that, we saw an idea of controlling life by himself, herself, that is very attractive. Something that we don’t have. So that attraction overcame your fear? I’d say so, yes. That attraction is simply called ""hope"". That is something that would oversome anything. would overcome anything. Let me ask you a specific thing. The Chinese nation, I think, would always associate you with a particular moment. You and a few other student leaders were invited to the Great Hall of The People for a televised meeting with one of the chiefs at the time, Li Peng, it was a sign that the party hierarchy was listening. But when you got there, you did not obediently accept and pay respects to Li Peng, you interrupted him. You said ""sir, with all due respect, this meeting has come a month too late"". You said ""we should be setting the agenda, not you"". That was extraordinarily confrontational. It was the 30th, 40th day of the student movement. Yes, we were on hunger strike. Of course it is confrontational. With all due respect, I think we invited them on that occasion. They said they invited us over, that is not what we had in mind. We asked for Li Peng to come up to have dialogue. That’s always been the keyword of1989, ""dialogue"". Eventually, we were asked to go to a place to sit with them. We thought maybe, this is the dialogue? It wasn’t a dialogue, it was a monologue. A lecturing. It is condescending. It is showing a message to the Chinese people that we students went too far. The elderlies, the hierarchies there were giving us some lecturing, some lessons. That cannot be televised to the Chinese people, because it would be the wrong message. What happened, after 20, 30, 40 days, we applied the pressure and we realised something was happening. Then, this happened. And this cannot be interpreted into something else. Do you think it made a difference? That image of you sort of treating Li Peng as an equal, not as some superior being from the top of the party, but an equal. Do you think, whatever happened afterjune 4th 1989 in China, that that image and moment still matters? In two aspects, number one, did it matter? Did it make an influence for the decision that the Communist Party made when we are talking about massacre? About the tanks moving in? Yes, I don’t think so. The meeting, the set of that occasion, that was basically part of the whole plan. Before that day, they had no plan. They did not know how to deal with this. They did not know when the world, the troops of world journalists coming to China to cover the summit between China and the Soviet are working to a revolution. They would broadcast the image to the world, and the pressure is enormous. Then, the whole society stood up to support the students. They had no anticipation of this. So, they had no movement until that day. When that happened, when Li Peng agreed to meet us, the whole plan, the decision was made already. That is how communists operate. You have used this word, ""massacre"". Of course. It is a word that the Chinese government refuses to accept. But, I want you to tell me what you, even 25 years on, recollect of your feelings, when you realised that it was happening? That tanks were rolling into Tiananmen Square, live ammunition was being used, and hundreds, some say thousands, of your peers, students, protesters, some onlookers as well, were being killed? The term ""massacre"", of course, it has been attached to who I am in the last 20 something years. There were a few occasions where I looked into the dictionary on this word. It is like killing indiscriminately. Every dictionary that you open, you will find the same answer for that. That is what it is, the troops roll in. They have agenda. They need to clear Tiananmen Square. Whoever on their way, they were given green lights to use real ammunition. And they did. Did you escape early? I was in the Square. Tiananmen Square itself was not really the killing field. It was the avenues leading into it? Yes. When the troops came to Tiananmen Square, Liu Xiaobo negotiated a term with the troops to avoid a massacre at the Square. So, for him to get the Nobel Peace Prize, this is definitely one of the most important conditions, I believe. Did you try to speak to any of the soldiers yourself? No. Earlier, I went to one of the front lines, on the east side, to see what was happening there. But, it was way too chaotic, there was no way to speak to anyone at the time. Shooting had already begun. I saw people shot down. The noise of bullets travelling in the air, that is something I can still remember vividly. The people’s blood, the smell of the people’s blood, also. That is a bona fide massacre, sir. Did you believe that you would get out alive? No, I did not. After the massacre, there were rumours after the fourth ofjune that we were hiding in cities. For me, the idea is to turn myself in. There were rumours in Beijing to say, OK, the number one most wanted, they want him alive. That is the order given to the soldiers and police. They did not want me alive, they did not want to apprehend me. The rumour, of course, there’s no way to verify. But it sounds like the Communist Party. So, I don’t even see the chance to turn myself in. I decided to leave Beijing city, maybe outside of Beijing, I can manage to be arrested by police instead of soldiers? And maybe by doing that I can maintain some dignity in a personal level? You escaped, and you eventually made it to the west and to Taiwan, we will pick up your story back in Taiwan. Now, I want to reflect a little bit on the meaning of 1989, and Tiananmen Square, for today’s China. Because, today’s leaders in China still believe that the chaos, what they see as the chaos and the mob rule in Beijing injune of1989, is one of the best justifications for them maintaining their 1-party rule on the country today, because they are the guarantors of stability and security for the great mass of the Chinese people. They say nobody wants to go back to the crazy, awful days of Tiananmen. What is your response to that? They always say that. They have to remain in power to provide safety and stability. They are the source of China’s chaos. Not only in Tiananmen, but in the last 60 years. Doesn’t the pattern of events we have seen, for example, in the Middle East since 2011 support their case? That case being that you need a strong central government that is capable of imposing its will on the country, to deliver security? Because when you lose that, you can point to Egypt, Syria, Yemen, or a host of other countries, when you lose that you introduce chaos and then ethnic tensions and then internal violence on a scale that in China could only be imagined. Yet 750 years ago, you decided to adopt democracy. I am quite sure in the early days of the beginning of democracy it was quite chaotic in this country. And then you manage to prevail. And give them time. They need time. They need support. They need patting on the shoulder. ""You are doing good, you are doing better than yesterday"". Not to accuse the price they had to pay for democratisation. But suppose the argument would be that far from paying a price over the past 30 years, the Chinese people have reaped the reward of stability. We see the most extraordinary improvement of material living standards known in human history. 600 million people lifted out of poverty by the Communist rule inside China. Today’s president says, China cannot copy the political system or development model of other countries. It would not affect us. It would lead to catastrophic consequences. His message, with us you get to prosperity. In the early years of the last century, Hitler was saying the same thing. With the centralised Nazi rule in Germany after the war. Providing morejobs, stability, getting rid of poverty. Now the world needs to give them what we want. Are you seriously comparing today’s Chinese government with the Nazis? I am not, I am comparing the British. I am comparing the British in the 1930s with British people today. That is called appeasement. We have had democracy and we have always had enemies. They come in different forms and different shapes. The Nazis, the Communists, they are both the enemy of democracy. And when we are facing the enemy of democracy, sometimes we make major mistakes. This country remembers that mistake vividly. I am seeing it again. I guess it depends on what you think democracy is for. An influential diplomat, an ambassador in Singapore who has written books about what he calls particular Asian models of development, he says in the West we are too hung up on the process and mechanism of democracy. He says what matters is a government that delivers for the people, it does not need to be democratic in the western and individualistic sense. Because it is delivering for the mass of the people. On those terms, the Chinese government is delivering for its people. You are using the word of the Singapore Ambassador, that is the understanding of the western democracy world, that delivering is what is most important. I would go back to the 20s and 30s to Hitler. Every time I say Hitler, people say that, how about Mussolini? People say he is not as bad, not as evil. But he was providing, the one leader who was almost a modern Caesar. People remember him as the one who makes the trains go on time. I was in Italy, people asked me do we need to learn from China today, because Italy is in trouble. I say, you learn from China, why don’t you learn from Mussolini? They understood. Maybe you are exaggerating repression in China. In China today, you see protest movements. If you read the Internet, people have the space to criticise local officials. Xi jinping and his senior colleagues have responded to the frustration with corruption in China by launching a massive anticorruption drive with officials being brought down because the public is demanding B Clâ8I’IâI’ goVâI’I’IITIâI’Il. Something is happening in China. Something is always happening in that massive country. When the Western world thinks of the term corruption, the idea comes your mind as you have corruption in your democracies. That is bribery, that is money exchanging with the government. It is like nothing compared with the corruption happening in China. Xi jinping has the least interest in getting rid of systemic corruption. The government is corruption. China before reform, there was a so-called socialist country. They looted the former Republic of China. The got all of the capitalist property in the government. When they introduced at the time reform and then privatised it, who was benefited? The Communist Party ruling group. That is the corruption. Xi jinping cannot get rid of that. He is getting rid of a couple of overly done corruption. We have seen protests in Hong Kong, thousands of people on the streets. It did not really get anywhere. It is an ongoing movement. Let us look at the future. What do you see happening in China in terms of developing a mass demand for real political reform? The Communist Party do not know how to face, they are not used to facing people’s demand. They do not know how to do it, they do not know what to do. We wanted a dialogue in 1989. The dialogue has been the central phrase. Tibet wants dialogue. Hong Kong wants dialogue. They even decided to get their own flight to Beijing to have a dialogue. The Chinese government said, no dialogue. And you have tried to return to your homeland several times. You have said, arrest me and then take me back to my homeland. And then I can continue that dialogue in the courtroom of China. Even in the form of indictment. Are you serious about that? Despite the comfortable life in Taiwan, you would rather go back to your homeland to face a court and make your case for democracy? And then I could see my parents, at least in the form of a prison visit. To continue unfinished business. I remember one of our respected teachers back in 1989 who was in the street and supporting us. Now she is a dissident in China. She says if you are not in prison, there is something morally wrong. Iam moved. Can there be democracy in China? In your lifetime? Absolutely. I have to be optimistic. I watched one of the early BBC shows interviewing the Mahatma Gandhi. He was optimistic. Thank you very much. The advice is to keep track of the weather forecasts through tomorrow morning because we have some snow in one or two places. We are not talking about widespread snow. But in one or two places there could be a significant covering, maybe five centimetres in a couple of places. Stay tuned to your local radio updates. It is a very volatile situation that keeps changing. It is not a coherent area of snow or rain. It is very hit and miss. These clouds are just floating around with an area of low pressure. You can get a clear message of where most of the snow will fall. That is eastern Wales, parts of the Midlands into northern England. Maybe more across the hills. To the south of that, we are talking about rain. We might get a bit of snow mixing in. For Northern Ireland and the south-west of Scotland through the lower areas, some wintry weather first thing in the morning. Wherever you are, it will be a cold morning. There will be some good weather around the course of Wednesday. The best place to be is eastern Scotland. Possibly the north of England. It will be barely above freezing. For the rest of us, it is a grey day with a bit of rain and sleet. Then on Thursday it dries out. It will be misty and possibly frosty once again. A bit of sunshine in the afternoon. It is still cold. On Thursday, we are going to start to see some changes. From the Atlantic, a cushion of milder air will wash away the cold. These mild Atlantic winds will bring some weather fronts as well. We will be mostly talking about rain and less cold conditions coming in. Looking a little bit less cold. If you are travelling across Europe in the next few days, it is more or less the same. However, in the US some nice warm weather. ~ Hello, you’re watching BBC World News. I’m Adnan Nawaz. Our top story this hour is the annual keynote speech by the most powerful man in the world. In his State of the Union address, President Obama said the US is ready to turn the page after 15 years of war and recession. After a ll After all that we have endured, called the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lay ahead, know this: the shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. Welcome to the programme. Other stories that we are keeping across for you: Ukraine’s President flies home from the World Economic Forum because of heavy fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. Violence against journalists in Afghanistan is increasing, putting freedom of speech under threat, according to a new report. I’m Sally Bu ndock. In business: A focus on middle class economics at home and smarter trade deals abroad was the message from President Obama. We get reaction from the top business leaders gathered in Davos. A critical day for Microsoft as the tech giant attempts to win back customers with the launch of Windows 10. In his last-but-one State of the Union address to Congress, the sixth of his presidency, Barack Obama has declared the United States is turning the page after years of war and recession. He called for higher taxes on the wealthy to call for a better deal for the middle class. Internationally, he urged people to help end the embargo on Cuba. Naomi Grimley reports. To Capitol Hill for his sixth and penultimate State of the Union. But speaking for the first time before a Republican Congress. A president who had set out to extricate America from its foreign wars is now having to cope with a myriad of new challenges abroad. Not least the jihadists threat to ancient allies like France. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks and we reserve the right to act unilaterally as we have done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat and our allies. Some members of Congress took their cue from that and made their show of solidarity for those killed in Paris. On the domestic front, Michelle Obama must be pleased that her husband’s approval ratings are now edging back up after a dismal few months. The President is hoping he can improve his standing further hy he can improve his standing further by proposing tax rises for the very wealthy. That way, he says, everyone can emerge from the financial crisis. We have pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America. The speech suggests there is a new-found confidence at the White House that America’s economy is bouncing back. That and the fact that Barack Obama doesn’t have to fight for re-election means he can afford to be a bit older in his final two years in office. Let’s get some reaction to the State of the Union speech from several American lawmakers. In a moment we will hear from Democratic Senator Bob Casey. Firstly, a Republican congressman from Kansas, accusing President Obama of being out of touch with reality. We are talking about a president who has more people on food stamps, more people of working age not working than at any time in history. When I listen to these comments, what I see very clearly is that he is disconnected from the reality. He is disconnected from what the American people saw when they change the Congress has passed November. Especially when he spoke about national security. We have all seen the radical Islamic terrorism around the country over the past weeks. And we have a president with no strategy, and he didn’t talk about that at all tonight. In 2009, we were losing 750,000 jobs every month. Month after month after month. There is no strategy to be able to deal with that. Now, we have to be able to deal with that, we need more private sectorjobs. The numbers matter, but I would say there is still a ways to go. A commensurate wharf rising wages hasn’t happened to the extent thatit wages hasn’t happened to the extent that it should, sol wages hasn’t happened to the extent that it should, so I would agree that we have a ways to go to address middle-class families and the wage issues. That is why the President spoke at length, and has been doing that I think that his presidency started, to focus on the middle class. That has to be a priority for both sides. And Sally is here with all the business news. This is the opposite to the trickle-down economics, surely, of Ronald Reagan. It was a big part of his speech, basically closing the gap between the very wealthy and those who are in need, as it were. He was at pains to point out what he has done so far to help those who are wanting as it is described. We will be live in Davosin is described. We will be live in Davos in Switzerland, where the world economic Forum isjust getting under way. world economic Forum isjust getting underway. Business under way. Business leaders, politicians and leaders of other significant organisations from all over the world will gather to discuss the key issues facing economies, the global economy, et cetera. We will get expert views from leading economists and chief executives as to what they think about the State of the Union address. There is no doubt that what President Obama had to say on the economy is what the American people wanted to hear. The experts agree with his prognosis? That is, the world’s biggest economy has turned a page. And what can he do to close the gap tween rich and poor in his final few years in office? We know he doesn’t have the majority he needs to push through his agenda. We will be looking at that in detail in World Business Report. Today is arguably the most important day in Microsoft’s recent history, as it’s expected to unveil its new operating system. Windows 10 is due for its first big outing as the company looks to re-establish itself against rival Apple. Last year Apple reported increasing sales, with the rest of the PC market, including Windows-powered machines, falling in comparison. If Microsoft gets it right, it’s likely to rescue the company from the flop of Windows 8, which put many people off with its tiles and complicated screen pages. Today is the start of the BBC’s new season A Richer World. Throughout the series, we’ll have multimedia stories from different continents showing the development of this richer world, and reflect on some of the tensions created by inequality. We’ll show how divided some places are, between extreme wealth and poverty. The BBC’s Selin Girit presents Istanbul. In the city you can live in a luxury apartment with a view of a slum, where people are either unemployed or earn less than $4 per day. This divided city is a -- or earn less than $4 per day. This divided city is a -- Istanbul. Turkey has more than 40 billionaires. It is Europe’s fastest emerging market and construction is the main driving force. The city’s residence are used to living in a 24-hour building site. Away from the tourist exports it is common to see a super Rich house next to the super poor. Economic growth and allotment have changed our lives. People are better educated and connected, they eat better and live longer.

Ukraine’s President, Petro Poroshenko, is to return home from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland because of heavy fighting between government forces and pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army said its troops had come under fire from Russian regular forces, a claim that couldn’t be independently verified. The Vienna-based European Security body, the OSCE, has called for an immediate ceasefire. Bethany Bell reports from Vienna. Running for cover in Donetsk. Fighting between government forces and pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine is intensifying. The shelling caused panic among residents. There have been more casualties. TRANSLATION: Everybody fell down casualties. TRANSLATION: Everybody fell down on the floor, off the ground, and in a minute ortwo fell down on the floor, off the ground, and in a minute or two there was another explosion. After the second explosion we went out on the street. We heard crying and found that we had one person injured and another one killed. What meanwhile, the Ukrainian army said its troops have come under attack from Russian regular forces have come under attack from Russian regularforces in the region of Luhansk. This information has not been independently confirmed. TRANSLATION: Ukrainian military units were attacked in the north of the anti-terrorist operations owned hy the anti-terrorist operations owned by regular Merit three formations of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Heavy fighting is continuing at Ukrainian army check points 29 and 31. Anti-terrorist forces have stopped the advance of Russian troops. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to try to calm the situation are intensifying. In a rare show of unity, all the countries in the European security body, the OSCE, which includes Russia and Ukraine, called for an immediate ceasefire. The Russian envoy to the OSCE told the BBC Moscow was working hard to bring about a settlement. Russia is very active. We are most active in trying to establish truth and settlement, not only in words but indeed. The foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France are due to meet soon to discuss the crisis. But there are fears that violence will continue. The American ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, has said the recent escalation in fighting in the east could constitute a turning point in the conflict. Speaking to the BBC, the Ambassador laid responsibility for the increase in violence directly with Russia, which he said was supplying separatist forces with heavy artillery and fighters. He said the immediate international efforts will be concentrated on defusing the situation. He’s been speaking to our correspondent David Stern in Kiev. We have unilateral US information regarding the military equipment that we see moving across the border. We have seen hundreds of pieces of heavy military equipment, tanks, rockets, other material, since September fifth. Also of great concern is the fact that we have now recently seen other Russian military equipment moving into the regions of south-western Russia, which have been used as supply points and launching point for infiltration of the separatist groups in the territory. All of this is contrary to the obligations that Russia itself undertook as a signatory of the Minsk agreement back in September. Is what has been happening, is this the turning point? We think in many ways it is. Certainly a cause for all of us to reassess and regroup. The evidence of that is the tragic human consequence. Heavy ammunition is being used in these indiscriminate shelling attacks. As Democrats, we are committed to working as hard as we can to try to put this back on a diplomatic track. That is what will happen again today, and to borrow at the UN Security Council. We understand there maybe a discussion at the Normandy Foreign Minister’s level in Berlin. This recent readmission of the crisis is the consequence of actions that have been taken by the Russian government, and which will de-escalate the actions, only when Russian authorities stop the movement of weaponry and troops TT’IOVâTT’IâI’1tofWâ8poIâ1I’y and tI’00pS GCFOSS movement of weaponry and troops across the border. Ukraine is the victim. These people exercise a sovereign right to defend their own country. Stay with us on BBC World News, still to come: The Tanzanian music trend which is sweeping across Africa. Now a look at some of the UK news. The BBC understands that the official inquiry into the reasons for the UK’s involvement the 2003 Iraq War will not publish its findings before the general election. The chairman of the inquiry, Sirjohn Chilcot, is expected to confirm in a letter to David Cameron that it will be delayed until after the poll in May. The inquiry began in 2009, and the last evidence was heard in 2011. Researchers say a more sensitive blood test could help pick up thousands of heart attacks in women that are currently missed by doctors. The team in Edinburgh found it allowed them to successfully diagnose twice as many women as the current common method. The new, more sensitive, blood test has been recommended by UK regulators, but some hospitals don’t currently use it. A group of MPs who’ve been looking into whistle blowing in the NHS in England say the failure to protect staff who raise concerns has undermined the willingness of others to come forward with some serious issues. The Health Select Committee says this could potentially have major implications for the safety of patients and staff. This is BBC World News. I’m Adnan Nawaz. The latest headlines: President Obama has set out an upbeat vision of the United States in his State of the Union address. He told Congress the country is ""ready to turn the page"" after 15 years of war and recession. An Afghanjournalist, Aqil Muhammad Waqir, has become the first media casualty of 2015, when he was shot dead while attending a wedding. Human Rights Watch says threats and violence against journalists in Afghanistan are increasing. In the world’s newest democracy, free speech is under threat, as David Loyn reports from Kabul. The growth of free media is one success story of the new Afghanistan. Here a woman presented real is the Afghani general in charge of communications for the army, unthinkable in the former Taliban period. All is not as it should you. journalists are threatened routinely and killed. The killers are allowed to get away with there. The people who make violations against the media, they think there is never a follow-up to this, they became brave and did it again. People think they can kill journalists and get away with it? Yeah, it is the definition of impunity. No one is following the cases in Afghanistan, in the government. A local radio journalist, Aqil Muhammad Waqir, was the first media casualty of 2015 in Afghanistan. His colleagues staged a protest after he was killed. The complaint from ruraljournalists who spoke with Human Rights Watch was that they faced intimidation if reporting land grabs. To protect themselves they hold back from doing the reports. They shy away from these critical issues, packed a self-centred ship and many journalists see they routinely have to censor themselves to survive and keep doing any work as a journalist -- self-censorship. Every night, newspapers are put out a personal risk for editors and reporters if they offend those in the government, Taliban or criminal interests. We face a lot of threats on a daily basis. Every day when I do not receive a threatening call I think I have not done the rightjob. It has been almost 14 years since the fall of the Taliban, a dictatorial regime in Afghanistan. And still the business of reducing a daily newspaper is not a safe occupation. Human rights campaigners have appealed to the new government to come out more strongly to protect those on the frontline of free speech. David Loyn is in the Afghan capital, Kabul. What is the solution to promote free press and make sure stories can be reported that journalism press and make sure stories can be reported thatjournalism requires reported that journalism requires to be done? While, to build on the last point in that report you saw, the president here, human rights campaigners would like President Ashraf Ghani to say more, he has said nothing since coming to office. In the first day since coming into office he rescinded the expulsion order on an American journalists, a New York Times journalist expelled hy New York Times journalist expelled by President Karzai. That was seen as a move in the right direction. He has done nothing to buttress their strong part of this new democracy, the rule of law and taxation and all these things don’t count unless they are accountable and the people can see what’s going on through the media -- this. There hasn’t been enough done in this country to protect those journalists in difficult places in the countryside who self censor, hold back, when they find out wrongdoing rather than putting it into newspapers for fear of their lives. And in a country which still has a legacy, still currently has existing warlords, thatis currently has existing warlords, that isjust one of the reasons why this kind of thing is important. Rather than that, let me ask you about foreign journalists and what they experience in Afghanistan. It is more difficult for domestic staff. What’s it like for you? That’s interesting and of course one of the things this report highlights is that there are fewer foreign journalists based here than there were at the height when they were so many foreign forces in the country. That makes it more difficult for localjournalists because some of these more difficult issues are reported Iforeign these more difficult issues are reported I foreign journalists, which provides cover for local journalists to come up behind them. Speaking personally, we get very good access on the whole, we do get treated respectfully but I think that isn’t the same if you are a young reporter in a provincial place where you live next door to the warlord you are trying to investigate or trying to report his wrongdoing. There are two classes of journalism in this country, foreigners and locals and the locals are treated badly. Thank you very much indeed. In sport, at the Africa Cup of Nations on Tuesday, the opening matches in Group D both ended as 1-1 draws. In the first game, ten man Ivory Coast were held to a 1-1 draw by Guinea. Mohamad Yattara gave Guinea the lead, and when Gervinho was sent off for violent conduct, it didn’t look good for the Elephants. Seydou Doumbia salvaged a draw. In the next game, which was played at the same stadium in Malabo, Mali took the lead but were pegged back by Cameroon. Cameroon only had two shots on target in the entire game, but equalised with six minutes to go. A draw in the very first game of the Cup of Nations for the Ivory Coast and a lucky draw as well after Gervinho saw red after a very silly red card. We have a fan here. What did you make of the game, were you happy with the performance of the team? Happy. Not too happy. My people have to try to pass. We have to win. If we beat Guinea we can go in front. They didn’t play well today? Nothing happened. What about the sending off, the red kite of Gervinho Klose Dominic West that was it right? It wasn’t a red kite. It look like peace Tim. No. -- smacked him. -- the red part of Gervinho? What did you make of the game? We are happy that we drew the match. The next match we can try to win. It was a straight red card because Gervinho tried to hit somebody. We played very well. Twickenham win. Equatorial Guinea fans supporting the Ivory Coast. They are the favourites. They didn’t play like it to day and they have it all to do to qualify for the next round. A new genre of music, known as Bongo Flava, from Tanzania is becoming very popular across Africa. It started in the early 1990s as a Tanzanian version of hip-hop and R&B, but back then most artists weren’t taken seriously. That’s all changed, as Salim Kikeke reports from Dar es Salaam. Award-winning artist AY is laying down the track for his latest single, saying mostly in Swahili, Bongo Flava was originally seen as Western culture trying to fight its way into a conservative society. Our parents, they always, you know, fighting with us, turned to music, because it is like something from the street. There is not any future in it. AY started his career 14 years ago and is among a few artists who persevered, believing that one day his music would be big. His turn at city paid off, he is now making a very lucrative career out of Bongo Flava -- his tenacity. It is a career many young people are keen to C8I’ââI’ ITI8I’Iy VOUFIQ people BFE i(ââI’I to pUI’SUâ. career many young people are keen to pursue. These days there are a number of centres set up privately to teach and train young people to sing and play instruments free of charge. This young lady has travelled hundreds of kilometres to get here and learn how to sing. She says one day she would like to be as big as Rihanna. Since I am here at the House of Catt talent I wondered if I can give it a go and see if I can sing. -- the House of Talent. Stop. You need more training. It looks like I can’t sing.

Our top story is the state of the union address delivered to Congress hy union address delivered to Congress by President Obama in which he said that after years of war and recession, the United States has turned the page -- State of the Union. Plenty more on the BBC website. We have snow falling across parts of the country. A smothering of frost for others. There could be disruption tomorrow morning, so stay tuned to the latest weather updates. We are talking about mostly eastern Wales, around the Midlands and also northern England. We could see a few centimetres of snow lying on the ground, so it could be slippery on the roads. What is happening right now is we have an area of low pressure, and a weather front slicing the UK here. It’s to the east where we have the colder air. It is quite a volatile situation. These areas of rain, sleet and snow are very hit and miss. It isn’t one big, coherent area of snow or rain. It is very broken up. That is why we are seeing these localised areas of snow. First thing in the morning it is eastern Wales, the Midlands and northern England, the Peak District, to the south, we are talking about rain with snow mixing in maybe across the North and South Downs, the London area. We don’t expect snow to settle further south across the country. Another area to point out is Northern Ireland and the south-west of Scotland as well as the lowlands, could be wintry weather here first thing with temperatures very close to freezing. What’s going to happen through the course of Wednesday? For many of us, the story says it all, it is a grey day with a wintry mix of weather. There will be sunshine around for sure. The best of the weather is eastern Scotland, the Borders, Newcastle and Edinburgh could be a fine day but cold. These are the temperatures we could get, for some of us, not far off freezing through the day, and it is balmy in Plymouth, seven degrees, relatively speaking. Mist and fog on Thursday morning with frost too. Sunshine in the afternoon. A cold day again. Thursday and Friday, we start to see the cold air pushing away and this milder Atlantic air is going to filter in, so things are going to - at least they look as though now - turn a little bit warmer with Atlantic winds coming from the west and pushing in some weather fronts. As well as slightly milder conditions, less cold, I should say, there will be a little bit of rain once again. That’s it. Bye bye. This is BBC World News, the headlines: In his sixth annual State of the Union address, President Obama has said the US is turning the page after years of vicious recession and war, with the economy creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Mr Obama called on Congress to pass a resolution authorising the use of force against Islamic State. He said the US was leading a broad coalition that would ultimately defeat the organisation but warned the process would take time. The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, is returning home early from the World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland because of heavy fighting between government forces and pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. The findings of a long-awaited inquiry into Britain’s involvement in the 2003 Iraq War are to be delayed until after the general election in May. More time is being offered to witnesses to respond to allegations made against them. Those are the latest headlines from BBC World News. Now for the latest financial news with Sally Bundock in World Business Report. A focus on middle class economics at home and smarter trade deals abroad was the message from President Obama. We get reaction from the top business leaders gathered in Davos. A critical day for Microsoft as the tech giant attempts to win back customers with the launch of Windows 10. Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Sally Bu ndock. Also in the programme: The Bank ofjapan continues its massive stimulus programme but slashes its inflation target. We’ll have the latest from our team in the region. The American economy is healed and now it’s time to focus on middle class economics. That was the key message from President Obama as he addressed the American people in his sixth state of the union address. The President claimed his mission now is to close the gap between the well off and the wanting and US economy is on course for strong growth in 2015. It has been and still is a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough yearfor America, page. Tonight, after a breakthrough yearforAmerica, our page. Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs are the fastest pace since 1999. To bridge the gap between the rich and poor Obama talked about changes to tax policies and income equality. He also had a lot to say about the oil industry declaring the US is now free of reliance on imported oil for the first time in 30 years, and he talked a lot about trade and America’s position in the global market place. But by contrast, according to the global CEO survey from PriceWaterhouseCoopers, this recovery is fragile. The report showed that Chief executives are less optimistic about the global economy in the yearahead. So who is right? Is Obama right to claim the US can grow strongly despite weakness around the world? I am nowjoined by Dennis Nally, Chairman of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, one of the leading accountancy firms in the world, and author of the CEO survey. He is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Give us your reaction to what Obama had to say. Is he too optimistic? I think there is a degree of optimism and it is probably not unfounded. The US economy is clearly moving in the right direction, in fact many of the CEOs we interviewed suggest that their confidence levels around the global economy is better than many of their peers outside the US. But it is hard to say we are out of the woods when you look at the economy and the challenges it still has to deal with. and the challenges it still has to dealwith. He deal with. He also had a big focus on what he called middle-class economics and the issue of trying to help the have-nots become those who have more wealth, and also make those who were earning a heck of a lot give more in terms of taxes. That is very much the theme at Davos, isn’t it? This problem of a very small minority in the world having a lot of wealth compared to the vast majority of people. There is no question about that. The question about stagnating wages in a post recession environment, it is a challenge, an issue, and it needs to be addressed. I noticed in Obama’s speech last night, he is focused on a number of specific or targeted tax reforms. We would suggest that the direction of travel is right, but it must be a much more holistic view around tax reform that is the types of reforms to the type of the economy that the US has today, and importantly what will really encourage investment and job creation. Those are the types of reforms that are long overdue, but hopefully will continue to accelerate the US economy. According to your survey that you conduct in the run-up to Davos, in which you speak to a lot of chief executives around the world, many I understand are very pessimistic, compared to last year. Why is there that significant shift? It is a great point. The level of CEO confidence about global growth has declined year-to-year. That is reversing a trend we have seen the last couple of years. Obviously, CEOs are more about what is happening around the world, maybe not a surprise. What is really interesting is that the confidence levels coming from CEOs in the developed economies, that is the US, the UK, Germany in particular, those confidence levels increased. The confidence levels of CEOs in developing markets declined. Most notably, China. With the exception of the confidence levels from CEOs in India, all of the confidence levels from CEOs in Brook countries declined year-to-year, which suggests some fundamental issues that are affecting various economies around the world, therefore having a negative effect on overall confidence levels this year versus last year. We appreciate your time. The chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers joining us from the world economic Forum in Davos. The Bank ofjapan has decided to maintaine its massive monetary stimulus, but it slashed its inflation outlook for the fiscal year starting in April as plunging oil prices dent its efforts to slay deflation. For more, let’s go to Rico Hizon in our Asia business hub in Singapore. Interesting to hear howjapan is doing in the midst of this State of the Union address in the US and Davos, et cetera. It is looking quite grim, Sally. It has been downgraded, and now has been reduced to half of its original goal of 1%. The prices have lost barely half of their value sincejune. Basically, their value since june. Basically, their value sincejune. Basically, the main deterrent for rising prices, and this is keeping the central bank under pressure to act again through continued bond and risky asset purchases worth around 700 billion US dollars. There is also the sales tax increase from five -8% from April one last year, which boosted inflation but only had a temporary in fact. -- effect. Many say the economy will suffer a contraction at the end of the fiscal year by 0.5%. They are quite optimistic about the new fiscal year, which starts on April the first, saying that it will expand by 2.1%. As a result, we have a stock market that is slipping, and in late trade due to the contraction use from the past fiscal year, there is a drop in the dollar. Today is arguably the most important day in Microsoft’s recent history, as it’s expected to unveil its new operating system. Windows 10 is due for its first big outing as the company looks to re-establish itself against rival Apple. Last year Apple reported increasing sales, with the rest of the PC market, including Windows-powered machines, falling in comparison. If Microsoft gets it right, it’s likely to rescue the company from the flop of Windows 8, which put many people off with its tiles and complicated screen pages. With me is Tim Danton, editor-in-chief at PC Pro. Good morning, Tim. This is very important, isn’t it? Not least for relatively new chief executive Satya Nadella. Yes, it is time for him to deliver the vision. We haven’t seen that from Microsoft recently, and it has a lot of persuading to do. There is this idea that it has lost the hearts and minds of some of its core customers, especially business customers, and they want to see something amazing, that will transform their business. That is what we are looking for. That was supposed to be Windows 8, and that was a disaster. I’m not sure Microsoft would call that a disaster, because it did allow for a whole new device to be created. I have spoken to a lot of manufacturers of the Hewlett-Packards, the Lenovos, and they have these lovely shiny devices. They don’t like the interface. No. What will Windows 10 look like? Much more like Windows seven, which is the opposition for Microsoft. In a way, it is itself. There is that familiarity, and that should help. Do you think this will be the game changer for Microsoft, which Windows 8 was supposed to be? I think it is too early to say. They have a lot of convincing to do, so we need to see the devices in action. We need to see that actual dovetailing between the software and hardware, and for it to be a beautiful experience, which we haven’t seen before. We need to back that up with a whole raft of services. We will watch with interest later. Thank you for your thoughts.

The new more sensitive blood test has been recommended by UK regulators but some hospitals don’t currently use it. Michelle Roberts has more. Early diagnosis of heart attacks can mean the difference between life and death. Foryears, doctors have relied on a blood test to help them judge if a patient with chest pains might be having an attack and meet other urgent investigations and treatment. New highly sensitive versions of the test had been developed to improve diagnosis, and now a study in the British Medical journal, funded by the British Heart Foundation, reveals that these tests are superior, particularly when assessing women. Doctors from the Edinburgh Royal infirmary who used the test on more than 1000 of their patients found it improved their detection rate. It help them spot twice as many heart attacks in women is the standard blood test. Experts say this is vital. Women will be diagnosed and treated earlier. We now need to know whether better treatment of these women using this test will lead to better outcomes. Our research at the moment is understanding how we can improve survival with men and women with heart disease following the use of this test. Forjenny Stevens, the test may have saved her life. They are picking up these oxygen levels in diagnosing heart attacks and people like myself, whereas normally if it had been the same levels as for Raman I wouldn’t have been diagnosed as having a heart attack and they wouldn’t have set the up for the angiogram, probably. and they wouldn’t have set the up forthe angiogram, probably. I for the angiogram, probably. I think it is incredibly important. The blood test is approved for use in the UK, but few hospitals currently use it routinely. I’m Adnan Nawaz. The top stories this hour: President Obama has declared his State of the Union address a moment for America to ""turn the page"" after years of ""vicious recession"" and long and costly wars. Mr Obama said the ""shadow of crisis"" had passed, with the economy recovering strongly. But he also reached out to the Republican Party, calling for bipartisan action on the economy. Mr Obama said American leadership had halted the advance of the group known as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He said the US was leading a broad coalition that would ultimately defeat the organisation but warned that success may take a long time. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight I call on this Congress to show the world we are united on this mission by passing this decision to use force against ISIL. The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, is returning home early from the World Economic Forum meeting in Switzerland because of heavy fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists in the east of his country. The Ukrainian military said its troops had been attacked by regular Russian army units. It’s emerged that the findings of a long-awaited inquiry into Britain’s involvement in the Iraq War won’t be published before the general election in May. The inquiry was set up by the British government in 2009, and the last witness gave evidence more than three years ago. Now it is time for our newspaper review. Sally and I will show you some of the headlines from around the world. The Financial Times leads with news that investors have snapped up debt from the eurozone periphery ahead of the ECB’s expected quantitative easing. The Moscow Times reports that Russian delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos will be working hard to convince the world that the country remains a good investment. The Business Standard reports that the IMF has predicted India will be growing more quickly than China by the 2016-2017 tax year. France and Germany have joined the UK in demanding that American tech firms do more to police terrorism-related content. That’s in the Wall Street journal. Britain’s six-year inquiry into the Iraq War will not be published before the general election in May, angering many who say it should have been put before voters long ago. The Guardian has the story. And the Times reports that for some women, having their partner present during childbirth is not a soothing influence but instead seems to worsen the pain. That will be an interesting conversation. Yeah. FinancialTimes, conversation. Yeah. Financial Times, your story. joining us is justin Urquhart Stewart, Director of Seven Investment Management. Such a nice and regular face the sea. Let’s start with the Financial Times -- face to see. All attention on the ECB tomorrow. Will it be the day it introduces quantitative easing? The FT with a picture of Mario Draghi and Angela Merkel looking at him with quite sort of... Interesting image on herface. You don’t want to be stared at by her like a. This betrays the problem in the ranks of the ECB that there are are Germans not happy about this idea -- that. There will be disappointment unless something happens tomorrow. It will likely happen that we will see QE. We have seen rates drop throughout the past few weeks. Interest rates dropping, currencies dropping, the Swiss franc last week. We have been seeing this pressure on disinflation heading to deflation. We saw Spanish debt, last year it was at 4%, now it is at 1.6%. It has dropped dramatically. There has been lots of refinancing. People are getting debt at a lower price. It is great for these countries top loop people are worried about the level of debt -- grateful if countries. The nub of interest paid doesn’t matter so long as rates remain low. Deflation rates are going up, still low at the moment. The cost of debt is still beneficial. Are we going to see this coming through? Yes, we are. Will it make a difference? It is all very well. We have seen the ECB help banks get stronger so they can lend. Getting money to the system QE. They won’t call it that, they will call it a forgettable name. Unless you have confidence in the economy, people won’t spend. It is like lighting a wet firework with damp matches. Trying to get it going without the manned is difficult. -- the mantle is the candidate inspire people to think things are getting better. Yesterday we have seen the confidence indicator is picking up -- demand. Investors will tell -- Russia will tell investors to come and invest money. Would you put money in Russia? It wouldn’t be the first place. It is getting bigger. That’s the problem. You are not supposed to be invading countries. While you have the issue of Ukraine heating up again, unfortunately, in terms of the structure within Russia, with this devaluation at the moment, it is in a position where the economy is shrinking. It will probably shrink by 5%. We saw figures yesterday coming from IMF and the World Bank shelling on average global growth of 3%. That is an 8% difference. Russia will have lots of pain next year. For the time being, Russia will have to clean themselves up, because it will be difficult. The Moscow Times highlighted that there are 70 delegates in Davos with the message that they are good place to invest so we will see how they get on. The Business Standard not surprisingly highlighting venues in the IMF report out yesterday suggesting the market will be racing past China, thatis market will be racing past China, that is the headline, in the years ahead. Interesting. We have waited four years for India. Does Narendra Modi take off the brakes and allow the country to grow? More people say they will. Lots of optimism about him and about India. Ad in the lower price of crude as well. India is a great beneficiary. It doesn’t produce oil. That is a boost. You can measure against China when China is slowing down. No one knows what it is growing at, about five or 7%. India increases, which is encouraging. It has to have the confidence to do so open the markets, which will be encouraging. I am getting the picture in the city that more people are turning to India to invest, those who haven’t already are opening to it. The Wall Streetjournal, we covered this a couple of times over the last few weeks, about European nations trying to urge an American tech companies to do more to track users to try to stop acts of terror. I can’t quite understand what the tech firms have against it. This is a fundamental issue of what is happening with technology, policing the world 100 years ago we need to control newspapers to make sure they can tell us what’s going on, these are now the areas of record. You need those people to be able to tell you what’s going on. You might call it the infringement of liberty but nonetheless they have the information of what is happening in the world and without it we would be significantly at risk, in terms of theissues significantly at risk, in terms of the issues you have seen in Syria, we need them. The Guardian front page and many other British pages, verdict delayed, no Iraqi war report until after the election which might come as great relief to the Labor Party. Your thoughts? Can you smell the smell of rotting words? -- Labour. This has been delayed so long. What are you hiding, people are saying. The Chilcot Inquiry as to what happened into the run-up to the Iraqi war. All of those issues. It has a political angle to it. We don’t know. The longer it goes on we get more suspicious. Frankly the sooner it comes the better. We won’t get it until after the election. Is that the right decision? If it came out now... ? It would cast a cloud over the pre- election process. The sooner it is a better. As I am suspicious of most politicians, the more we get things out to clear the air of suspicion, I would have thought that would be better. The Times, men shouldn’t be at the birth of their children. Oryou? Note! I can’t think of anything worse. I avoided the whole issue -- No. Adopt instead. It is much cleaner. You just get the baby pre- born. Presumably you’re at the birth is yellow I had a deal with my wife. I said as long as you take drugs I will be there. I couldn’t stand that I would be there with her when she was going through that pain -- you were at the birth? I have heard that the woman loses control of her senses and swears like a trooper. It happened to my wife. I had three and mY happened to my wife. I had three and my husband was there every time and he was incredible, I have to say. My former boss, Nick, if you are listening, he said my best piece of advice is to take off your ring because your wife will squeeze your hand so hard that you will be in pain as well. I did do that. How many rings have you gone through? This is still the original because I took it off. Thank you very much for your time. took it off. Thank you very much for yourtime. How your time. How many kids have you got? Three, I mentioned that already. Congratulations. By the way, justin is 60 today. Happy birthday. AT very much indeed. Have a lovely day. See you very soon. -- thank you very much indeed. The advice is to keep track of the weather forecasts through tomorrow morning because we have some snow in one or two places. We don’t have widespread snow and most of us won’t get it. If you live in eastern parts of Wales, the Midlands, northern England, hit and miss areas will get a good covering, maybe 2-5 centimetres. Stay tuned to the local radio for updates on the bad weather. It is a very volatile situation that keeps changing. It is not a coherent area of snow or rain. It is very hit and miss. These clouds are just floating around with an area of low pressure. You can get a clear message of where most of the snow will fall. That is eastern Wales, parts of the Midlands into northern England. Maybe more across the hills. To the south of that, we are talking about rain. We might get a bit of snow mixing in. For Northern Ireland and the south-west of Scotland through the lower areas, some wintry weather first thing in the morning. Wherever you are, it will be a cold morning. There will be some good weather around the course of Wednesday. The best place to be is eastern Scotland. Possibly the north of England. It will be barely above freezing. For the rest of us, it is a grey day with a bit of rain and sleet. Then on Thursday it dries out. It will be misty and possibly frosty once again. A bit of sunshine in the afternoon. It is still cold. On Thursday, we are going to start to see some changes. From the Atlantic, a cushion of milder air will wash away the cold. ~ *-8 -- a push. These mild Atlantic winds will bring some weather fronts as well. Rather than snow it will be mostly rain with mild, less cold I should say, conditions coming in. Looking a little bit less cold. Before I go, just to update you: If you are travelling across Europe in the next few days, it is more or less the same. However, in the US some nice warm weather. 23 degrees. Miami isn’t looking too bad as well. Can you let us know when you’re ready to start? Cos the suspense is killing me. # We’re gonna take this one step further... # On your marks... ..Get set... # ..Baaaaake! # # ..I’ve found the truth the stars are you... # So far, so good. # So, daydreamer # What you runnin’ for? # What you runnin’ for Daydreamer...? # Go, go, go. # ..What you runnin’ for daydreamer...? # I love this place. # ..What you runnin’ for?

196,BBC1 London,21-jan-2015,BBC London News,13:30,15 mins,True,"through the Through The look like we are through the worst of it now, although the snow keeps coming down, and there are weather warnings still in place for the Midlands, the North West and Yorkshire. Icy conditions expected on the roads into tonight. Dan, you hope the worst is over. We will find out. Thank you for that. The man who knows is here. Conditions are easing through the day and into the evening but we have seen significant snow during the overnight period and into the early morning and thank you to Harryjones for taking this lovely snowy, woodland scene. You can see quite a bit of snow but in some places not far from there that was not much snow at all, so it was patchy. The sleet and snow will continue to ease down, but still some snow falling in central parts of the UK, but to the north of the country, the best of the sunshine is across north-east Scotland and a few showers across the northern isles and some of these might contain a bit of a wintry mix, but it’s mostly rain, and the same for Northern Ireland. There is the area of snow affecting south and west Yorkshire potentially into greater Manchester and Cheshire. Some rain, a lot of cloud in the south-east of England and heavy bursts of rain across the South West, particularly in Dorset. Temperatures generally around to or 5 degrees. The sleet and snow goes away, and we have problems with nice as the temperatures fall away across the northern half of the country and we will see dense, freezing fog patches as well. Across the South where we have Cloud, a little less cold, between one and three degrees. A cold start of the northern half of the country on Thursday with the ice and fog clearing, and then we could she a decent day -- and fog clearing, and then we could she a decent day -- could see. We could see five or six Celsius across the West and South West but another cold day in store. Signs of change across the North West as we head across Thursday as the wind picks up and we see outbreaks of rain and mild air moves in Excel as we head into Friday, quite a change as the front sweeps in and we see the orange colour moving, but it will be brief because the blue colour will move in for the start of the weekend. Visit our Friday starts. A chilly start in central and eastern areas -- chilly start in central and eastern areas -- this is how Friday starts. Across the West, the weather front is moving in bringing stronger winds, outbreaks of rain but the temperatures will be eight or 9 degrees, but at cross the south-east, fairly chilly. Into the weekend, Saturday another cold day with some sunshine and showers, most across the north-west corner and some of them might be wintry, but by Sunday we are back to the milder weather. for the news where you are. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC London News. A man who had CS spray sprayed directly in his face by an Essex police officer has been awarded £21,000. The Essex force has made the payment to Alan Lethbridge in an out-of-court settlement, five years after the incident. The whole thing was captured by a television cameraman and you may find some of the pictures in Debbie Tubby’s report upsetting. This is where Alan Lethbridge has spent most of his compensation. It will enable him to go back to work next week for the first time in five years. Since he was sprayed, he says he suffered post-traumatic stress and never received a police apology. It is just a relief really that it is all finished with. I protested my innocence throughout the whole thing. I never got one apology from one police officer. Did you ever push for an apology? Do you have to push for an apology? Would itjust be common courtesy to say sorry? In 2009, Alan Lethbridge is held across the bonnet of a police car. While handcuffed, he is sprayed with CS spray at close quarters by an Essex Police officer. Then he is pulled to the ground. 24 hours after his arrest, he was released, still wearing his blood-soaked T-shirt. Five years after a true magic ~ -- five years after a traumatic experience, I have had mental issues I’ve had to go through. The pressure of post-traumatic stress disorder, the anxiety attacks. The moneyjust don’t do itjustice. It weren’t about the money anyway, it was about the principle that I hadn’t done anything in the first place. Injuly 2010, Alan Lethbridge walked free in court, cleared of all charges. Today Essex Police say they will not apologise, as the complaints by Mr Lethbridge were not upheld. But a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2010 recommended that the force clarifies its policy on the use of CS spray, and training is improved. I don’t think they want to admit that they were in the wrong. He’s an innocent man at the end of the day, isn’t he? And I think he deserves that more than anything. I think that would really help him with his everyday life, you know? If they were to say sorry. thatis that is all they’ve got to say, sorry Alan Lethbridge says he has had to pay back half his compensation after claiming benefits the last five years. He plans to appeal. Debbie Tubby reporting. Thirteen people have been arrested during a major police operation in Southwark this morning. Officers carried out a series of dawn raids in Bermondsey and Walworth as part of a four-month intelligence-led operation targeting individuals involved in drugs, burglary and gang-related crime. A man is suing a pharmaceutical company for more than £1 million for brain injuries he believes he suffered after taking part in an experimental drug trial. Former priest Adrian Hailer is now partially blind and unable to care for himself after taking part in the clinical trial at Hammersmith Hospital in 2012. He’s taking the company, Novartis, to the High Court. They say there isn’t a link between Mr Hailer’s condition and the drug, and they will be contesting the case. With the UK facing a shortage in engineeringjobs, a technology firm has teamed up with University College London in a bid to encourage more young people to go into computing. The company, ARM, is offering students an opportunity to develop their computer and coding skills, as Nick Beake reports. will up plotting your career path is not always straightforward, but these second-year electrical engineering students at UCL feel they are on track. They have been building their own robots and smartphone apps which could be the next big thing. I am wearing a heart monitor. I can monitor it here. And I can see it on the computer. It is hoped that this technology will benefit the NHS. But at the moment half all engineering graduates are walking away from computing. You are tempted by things like banking because they can offer the big salaries. But I think that might change now. A new partnership between a tech company and the university. Students are given a kit to develop their own inventions. My students have had the chance to work on something similar before but never something as sophisticated, easy-to-use and small. I think it will make them better designers, better engineers. I think it will give them the chance to do more fun things. This might be pretty good fun if difficult to master, but the sensor technology they are using here and experimenting with is what is being used elsewhere to create some pretty major innovations. For example, cards that drive themselves and parked themselves. This morning at this technology in education exhibition in East London it was announced that Google and 02 would be among those helping to deliver better computing lessons for primary school pupils. We want all our young people to be inspired about the future. Get the basics right, English and maths, but coding, computing and programming is very much part of Britain’s future, in the modern world. And the capital’s future success could well be built on this technology. Concerns have been raised over the level of violence at a privately run prison in south-east London. An unplanned inspection of Thameside prison, where a third of inmates have some sort of gang affiliation, found that it faced significant challenges. jean Mackenzie explains. When this prison was first inspected, violence was high and staff were inexperienced. The movement of prisoners was so restricted it had essentially been locked down. But nearly two years on and it is better news. The prison has improved markedly across all fronts. It was a respectful institution, well-equipped, and reasonably safe all-star prisoners felt safe. They worked well with those who had the risk of self harm. Opened in 2000 well, Thamesside is a privately run category B prison. Not all of its problems have gone away. The inspectors were deeply concerned with the amount of violence in this prison and at how many the prisoners are gang members. A third of the inmates here are affiliated to a Gang inmates here are affiliated to a gangin inmates here are affiliated to a gang in some way. That makes violence here more likely. When they come into contact with each other, they can attack each other without warning. Keeping them apart, keeping them safe and keeping them challenged is a big challenge for us. But it is being addressed. Since it started, gang-related violence has fallen dramatically. We speak to them in the morning. One of the first people they see is one of the Gang first people they see is one of the gang ‘s team, who have a conversation with them, saying what will you do if you have any conflicts? This is what you can do. There are fresh challenges ahead. This new wing will increase the number of inmates by a third. There is no doubt that this is a difficult prison to run, but progress looks promising. Tonight BBC2 screens the long awaited adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s award winning novel Wolf Hall, set in Tudor England. Peter Kosminsky was well aware of the passion readers had for the novel when he was adapting it. Our arts correspondent, Brenada Emmanus, has been speaking to him. Mark Ryland as Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall, the six part adaptation of Hillary Mantell’s historical novels. It reunites the actor with his director, who had to deal with the weight of expectation surrounding this ambitious production. You are aware of the huge weight of expectation. People love these books, they love them with a passion. They understand them, they know them in detail, they can recite sections of them. We’ve been trying to contain 1000 pages of prose in six hours of television. So yes, I think we’ll feel the weight of expectation. Cromwell. Why are you such a... Person! Great lengths were taken to meet the authenticity is, including filming in candlelight. The only problem shooting like that was that every 20 minutes a tour party would pass through and this was the deal we had to strike. Actors of the stature of Damian Lewis, Mark Ryland 's and jonathan Pryce, in full costume, candles lit, stopping every 20 minutes, so that 50 or 60 OAPs could walk through. How much was London itself central to this drama? London is absolutely a character in this story. Unfortunately to find buildings that would replicate, we largely had to go outside London. Both the author and director were adamant there would be no dumbing down. This is now chewed a romp. It is very understated, very realistic. It is a bit like watching an episode of eight contemporary thriller or whodunnit, but set in Tudor times. Anyone hoping for extravagant overacting will be disappointed. It is very low-key, very realistic. I think that is what the actors felt, that the environment in which we placed them encouraged that naturalistic style of acting. Right, let’s find out what the weathers up to with Kate Kinsella. Good afternoon. It is a bitterly cold day across-the-board. One or two outbreaks of cloud. The temperature really isn’t budging. The best we can expect even in central London is around four Celsius, later today. We will still have one or two outbreaks of rain. Fairly light in nature and most likely to fall as rain. There is the possibility of sleet towards higher ground. Untilthe possibility of sleet towards higher ground. Until the cloud starts to break later on in the night, the temperature is not going to drop down below zero. As it does that, we can expect perhaps as we have had some rain today one or two stretches of ice tomorrow morning. Maybe one or two fog patches. If the temperature is right, those fog patches could freeze. Eventually any fog should lift and we should get some breaks in the cloud will stop it will still be bitterly cold but we should see some sunshine and temperatures around four Celsius. Through Thursday night and into Friday and it is another cold one, with this temperature dominating. Expect some frost heading into Friday morning. Another cold day as we head into Friday. Quite a lot of cloud around but we should see some brightness. Things will turn just a touch milder. Sunshine around for Saturday and then we can expect some rain to return next week. We will be back at 6:30pm. This week on The Voice... Welcome to the show! # I got a feeling # Woo-ooh. .. # Whoa, no! Yeah! ",,

Unemployment has fallen again and earnings are up, according to the latest figures. The number of people out of work in the UK is now at a six-year low - down by 58,0000 in the three months to November. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.8% - that’s 1.91 million people out of work. And wages are outstripping inflation, with the average earnings increasing by 1.8%. Though there are significant differences around the UK. Our economics correspondent Andy Verity reports. Backinset Back inset an, this lady showed the world how determined she was to find work, and the world listened. Her song got more than 20,000 hits on Youtube. Then she got the call, offering her work as a supermarket fishmonger. It was quite life changing because it meant that I was working towards something, being part of society, doing the job, making my CV better. So I could excel in what I want to do, in that profession. But begging for a job is becoming less and less necessary. Not only have half a million people found work in the last year, there are now 700,000 job vacancies, more than there have been since 2001. That is giving skilled workers especially a stronger hand when they negotiate their pay. It might seem like bad news if you are an employer, but if you are the person whose skills are in demand, it can be good news, because firms have to compete to get you on board, meaning your wages can rise. In the slump, there were too many bricklayers, and they would be lucky to get £100 a day. At now, there are too few, and the daily rates have shot up to £150. It is all to do with supply and demand. It is the same with anything. The same with oil, no-one wants it, the prices stay low. Supply and demand, and we are wanted! It may be good for the pay of skilled workers, but for businesses it wishes up costs and delays production. If we are looking at half a million people leaving the industry since 2008, and a further 400,000 people leaving in the next few years, we have got to recruit an awful lot of people even to stand still. A nearby college, outside Norwich, is trying to plug that skills gap, trebling the numbers on its skills course. University loses some of its appeal when you can earn considerable amounts as a skilled joiner. You can work anywhere in the world if you are good at your trade. Behind the fall in unemployment are big regional variations. Behind the fall in unemployment are big regionalvariations. It big regional variations. It is down fastest in the West Midlands. In Wales it rose in the three months to the end of November. And in Scotland, it also went up. Unemployment also rose among the young, with three quarters of a million out of work, or 17%. But that will not undermine Sherika’s relief that she is no longer one of them. The former Prime Minister Tony Blair has rejected suggestions that he is behind the delays to the Iraq Inquiry report. Mr Blair, who took Britain to war in Iraq in 2003, says such claims are incorrect and ""politically motivated"". The Chilcot inquiry, which began six years ago, won’t now be published until after the general election in May. Here is our deputy political editor, james Landale. Tonight, British serviceman and women are engaged from air, land and sea... It is a war which began 12 years ago, a war which ousted a brutal dictator, a war which cost the lives of thousands. The decision by Tony Blair and George Bush to invade Iraq remains controversial. For the families of the 179 British soldiers who died, it is a decision they live with every day. Debbie’s husband Stephen died in 2003 when his tank was hit by so-called friendly fire. After 12 years, you know, there are people including myself who want answers. And the answers do not come, so we want to know why they went out there, why did they go out that quickly? Sir john Chilcot’s inquiry has already taken five years, delayed by illness, arguments over what should be published and the long process of giving people the chance to respond to potential criticism. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Sirjohn confessed that he cannot give an accurate estimate of how long it will take to complete the work... David Cameron said he was extremely frustrated at the delay but could not only what is an independent inquiry. I do not only what is an independent inquiry. Ido not inquiry. I do not believe from what I understand that anyone is trying to dodge this report or put it off. We all want to see it. But you have to go through the proper processes. The inquiry was established six years ago after our combat operations had ended, and my views on the Iraq war are well-known, and I want this inquiry published. Today Tony Blair denied that he was delaying the publication of the report. He trod a careful path but could not hide his impatience. I am frustrated it has not been published some time ago because for people like myself, when this inquiry finally comes out, it gives me an opportunity to say, this is why I did what I did and this is why I believed it was the right thing to do. But the Lib Dems, who opposed the war in Iraq, said the delay was incomprehensible. The public will start thinking, whether it is true or not, that the report will be sexed down, if you like. We often remember our war dead long after we have forgotten what caused the war in which they died. That is why the Chilcot Report matters. Some people have long made up their minds over the Iraq war, but others still want to know what happened, and why. It is a simple blood test that costs around £5, but it could save thousands of lives by detecting heart attacks in women. The test is much more sensitive than those currently used in many hospitals, and can pick up low levels of substances released by the heart during an attack, as our health correspondent Bra nwen jeffreys explains. jenni Stevens feels she has had more than one lucky escape. A busy mum, just 41 years old - she started having chest pains. Her GP tested her heart rhythm but that showed nothing wrong. It was only when she collapsed and went to A&E that she had the new blood test. Much more sensitive, it showed she had had a heart attack. It was notjust in my imagination. There was something going on. Because of this new test they found out what it was and it is being treated. If they had not treated me then it could have been so much worse for me. A heart attack can be hard to detect. One warning is raised levels of a protein. The standard test picks up raised levels in men at Mrs it in many women. This laboratory at the Royal Free Hospital in London already uses the more sensitive test. A blood sample taken from a patient in A&E can be analysed here within an hour for traces of the protein. That early warning sign allows a patient to be rushed into a unit like this, where their heart can be public examined and they can be given potentially life-saving treatment. And to do that, doctors here have set up an emergency treatment unit. They are now able to detect mild heart attacks more quickly in women. Using this blood test we can get in and prevent the full- blown heart attack happening. If we send patients home from the emergency department without delivering definitive treatment, then there is a risk that over the following days and risks they may then resent with a full- blown heart attack, which could be fatal. So, a simple blood test, cheap to use, could save the lives of women. This research could push more hospitals to adopt it. Some of the day’s other news stories now. Snow made driving treacherous in large parts of the country this morning - especially for the driver of this car in Sheffield. Leeds-Bradford airport was closed for a time and snow ploughs were busy across major roads in the north of England and north Wales. Hundreds of men around the West Sussex town of Bosham are being asked to voluntarily give DNA samples to police, so they can be excluded from a murder investigation. Valerie Graves was killed in December 2013. Since then detectives have interviewed nearly 10,000 people. An industrial dispute which has been disrupting water supplies in Northern Ireland has been suspended. Around 22,000 people have been affected by the action since Christmas. The dispute is over changes to pensions. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has told the BBC that the SNP WILL vote at Westminster on issues affecting the health service in England. At the moment, the SNP only takes part in Commons votes which have a direct impact on Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon said the move would be necessary to protect the health service in Scotland. She’s been talking to our political editor, Nick Robinson. As they sometimes say in Scotland, here is something that might really do your head in. Even though the referendum is long since over, even though Scots did not vote yes, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of this country, could soon be deciding notjust what happens here, but in the rest of the UK,too. The SNP has been signing up thousands of new members, many of them women. The party now has double Labour’s support in the polls, which could give them enough new MPs to hold the balance of power at Westminster. She claims they would help Ed Miliband into Downing Street, but how? I guess I am instinctively not too enthusiastic about formal coalitions. Never say never. enthusiastic about formal coalitions. Neversay never. I coalitions. Never say never. I guess I tend more towards an arrangement which is on a vote by vote basis, rather than a formal coalition, but first of all let’s see how people vote. It is her government, not David Cameron’s, which runs the NHS in Scotland. But listen to this... We would be prepared to vote on matters of English health, because that attention he has a direct impact on Scotland’s budget. If there was a vote in the House of Commons to repeal the privatisation of the Health Service in England, to restore the how the service, we would vote for that. But you are saying to English voters, we will come down south and vote on your health service? I suspect a lot of English voters would like to see and into the privatisation of the English health service, that that is a separate issue. This is the man elected to stop her, Labour’s new Scottish leader. He is desperately trying to reverse the plunge in his party’s standing. He warns Scots they might get a Tory government by accident. The big decision is how to get rid of David Cameron. I know that as I meet many SNP voters, who are thinking of voting for that party again, the last thing they want is David Cameron re-elected by accident. Many Scots want what they think is the best of both worlds, a Labour government in Westminster but backed up by the SNP. The Scottish Labour Party will stand up for Scotland’s interests, we are chaining our constitution, the way we work, we are confident, we are patriotic. -- we work, we are confident, we are patriotic. -- changing. And remember him? He could well be back. Alex Salmond hopes to lead an army of new SNP MPs from Scotland down to Westminster. It will not be you who is top dog, will it, it will be Alex Salmond, who will be the person deciding policies in Westminster? The SNP is a team and always will be. Scottish referendum already feels like quite a long time ago. But the truth is, it’s a legacy means that the battle over Scottish politics could become the battle over who runs Britain. The time is 6:15pm. Our top story this evening: A record 30 million people in work as unemployment drops to its lowest level for six years. And coming up, I’ll be live Later on BBC London: Should Mums go it alone in labour? New research suggesting that men could increase their partners pain. And remembering the long march 70 years on. We hear from the Prisoner of War who survived an epic walk from Poland into Germany. They’re called northern white rhinos - and they are on the brink of extinction. These animals - prized for their valuable horns - have been hunted by poachers for decades. Now there are just five of them left in the world. Conservation experts are desperately trying to find a way to save them. Our science editor David Shukman has been given special access to one of the last survivors. The quiet lonely shuffle of a giant animal facing extinction. One of the last five of a particular type of rhino, the northern white. It’s in a zoo in the Czech Republic, which over the years has built up one of the largest collections of animals from Africa. This kind of rhino no longer exists in the wild, because the horns that make them famous are highly prized by poachers. There are three northern white rhinos in Kenya, but they are guarded in a park and they are not reproducing. The last birth anywhere in the world was 15 years ago, so there is a real risk that this species will soon join the others that human activity has wiped out. You could witness them dying out one by one. And if you realise this, it is a really desperate situation and I personally really do not want to witness these animals dying outjust like this in a few coming years. The zoo has gone to extraordinary lengths to try to encourage more offspring. It’s quite a task hoisting a rhino weighing more than a tonne into the air. Repeated attempts at artificial insemination have all come to nothing, and every procedure comes with dangers. When you’re this close to a massive northern white rhino you realise just how difficult any technique for assisted reproduction is going to be because there are risks. In one operation here a rhino died, in another a keeper was killed. But with just five of these animals left this may be the last chance. So, scientists are exploring all the options. At this research centre in Berlin they use scanners to gain a better understanding of endangered animals. The specialists believe there are techniques that could save the northern white rhinos. Stored in liquid nitrogen are samples of sperm from one of the rhinos. They want to collect eggs as well in the hope of trying IVF, and beyond that there are more radical ideas for using tissue samples, including this one, to produce stem cells that could make embryos to bring the animals back from extinction sometime in the future. The samples will stay alive for 3000 years. So we hope we only need a few years to find technologies, which we can use to create babies out of the cells. Sometimes science can head off extinction. Giant pandas were helped, but there were still enough of them to avoid inbreeding. By contrast, Lonesome George, the famous Galapagos giant tortoise was the last of his line and died two years ago. Back in the zoo, IVF might be tried and it may work, or the northern white rhinos will slip away at a time when many other animals are also on the brink of extinction. David Shukman, BBC News, in the Czech Republic. President Obama has declared an end to the financial crisis and expensive wars and he told Americans that they should start enjoying the fruits of the country’s economic recovery. In his penultimate State of the Union address, the President said it was ""time to turn the page"" - and urged Congress to support plans to tax higher earners - to pay for a tax cut for working families. In Israel a Palestinian man has wounded 17 people in a multiple An energy company hoping to start fracking for shale gas in Lancashire has suffered a set back after officials recommended that their application should be rejected. The company, Cuadrilla, wanted permission to test for shale gas at locations between Blackpool and Preston. But planning officials say the work would generate too much noise and heavy traffic. judith Moritz reports. It may seem an unlikely battle ground but this rolling countryside in Lancashire is being hotly fought over. Drive along the country lanes and the warnings are writ large, fracking is not a future everyone wants here. We need to strengthen the objections. In this village pub they were pleased to hear that planners have said it shouldn’t happen nearby. People who might have thought that it was inevitable that this would get through will now be looking at it, reevaluating, and they will actually believing that this can be changed. There has been a victory today for common sense. I think that’s the main thing. But we are just about to go into the next part of this process. We are going to continue opposing this until we win. It isn’t really about us, it’s about our grandchildren and their children. It’s about the future. It will be up to the council to make a final decision next week. Much of the debate on fracking in Lancashire has been centred around the possible impact on this area. But the effects of this decision will be felt way beyond here with implications for the fracking industry across the UK and into Europe. The planners warned about excessive noise and traffic, but the company which wants to drill for shale gas here says it’s winning the environmental argument and other problems can be overcome. We believe the potential is to supply may be a quarter and up to a half of UK gas demand, notjust in this area. With North Sea gas running out and it’s running out quite quickly, it’s very important that we find gas to heat our homes and for people to cook theirfood. I think it’s quite necessary for the economy. Not all of the villagers oppose fracking. 90 Roy Gregory still runs his own business and thinks it could prosperity. It would be an advantage if we made use of this natural source of energy. Because, we import SOUFCE of âI’IâIâgy. BECBUSE, WE iITIpoIât BI’! source of energy. Because, we import an awful lot of energy. Meetings about fracking have filled village halls here. Passions are running high with all eyes on next week’s vote. HMS Victory - she was Lord Nelson’s flag ship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 - but more than two centuries later - she’s in urgent need of repair. Hundreds of thousands of people flock to see her every year in Portsmouth. She’s one of the oldest warships in the world - and now she’s facing a new battle of own. Our correspondent Robert Hall is alongside on the dockside and can explain all. It is one of the most famous sites in the world, still the Royal Navy’s flagship, HMS Victory, in fact 250 years old this coming May. But behind all that immaculate paintwork is a multitude of problems. The first of those problems is all too clear as you make your way forward along the upper gun deck. Rows of plastic buckets to catch the rainwater that has been seeping through her planks for decades. Victory has never really dried out and she’s been slowly rotting away from the inside. The conservation team have stripped away some of her hull to trace the leaks and they’ve managed to seal most of them. But the damage is widespread and irreversible. £500,000 funded this virtual reality laser survey of Victory. It took nine months, involved 89 billion measurements, examined 30,000 individual parts of the ship and confirmed another suspicion - that Victory was slowly collapsing in on herself. To see that second problem you’ve really got to come down here into the base of the deck and Andrew, the project director is with me. She is basically collapsing in on herself. It is a lot of weight we’ve got to support, 2200 tonnes, we do it off the keel wall but also these and those walls are too far apart and she is sagging. So you have the rotting and this, two horrific problems, how do you tackle them? Slow and steady, in terms of supporting the ship we will move from 22 supports to close to 140 props, in much better solution for supporting the ship, better for the ship and also for the dock. You’ve got to be careful because she is so precious. She is unique, so you don’t experiment, slow and steady, and then execute. Thank you for joining us. It’s going to be a big project and it’s looking like it might last at least ten years. Thank you, Robert. Time for a look at the weather- here’s Darren Bett. Lots of snow for some people, more on the way? There is very little snow right now. We are seeing fog forming already in Northern Ireland and they will be patchy fog elsewhere and some icy conditions for some places as well. Still a bit of snow over higher parts of northern England, and down towards East Wales but it will peter out. We have one or two showers in the north and the rain should clear away from East Anglia. Frost more marginal across the southern half of the UK because there is more cloud. Clear skies in the north and we will see frost and it could be -8 in the North of Scotland but at least there will be sunshine. It could be icy in the north-east of Scotland after some early showers. As well as fog. Where we have snow it will be slippery and if the cloud breaks after the wetter weather in East Anglia we could see some icy patches here as well. Generally speaking temperatures at 8am in the morning at rush hour a degree or two above freezing for much of England and Wales and a cloudy start. Many will have a dry day tomorrow. The cloud will be around to begin with, but it should thin and breaking a lots of places brightening up across the south-east and eastern parts of Scotland. But always a struggle across East Wales and the West Midlands and sunshine or not it will still be a cold day, typical temperatures around three or 4 degrees like today. Change on Friday, frosty start across England and Wales. Not so for Scotland and Northern Ireland, wind, cloud and rain edging its way into western parts of England and Wales lifting temperatures where it stays dry and brighter in the East still quite cold. It will be a roller-coaster this weekend. Saturday will feel cold in the north-westerly wind, most places dry. A few wintry showers across the North for a while. We change the direction on Sunday, south-westerly blowing in cloud and rain in the north-west but at least the temperatures will be on the rise. When Hugh, Darren. They fall in unemployment, dropping to its lowest level in six years and a rise in average earnings. We can get a final thought from Robert Peston at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. How do you read the latest figures and what does it mean for interest rates? I’m on the top of a Swiss mountain because the governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor are both due here at the World Economic Forum. The Bank of England published minutes of its interest rate meeting today, and they said something which a lot of borrowers in the UK will be pleased about. They sent a signal that interest rates won’t be rising, perhaps not until the beginning of 2016. That may seem rather extraordinary given we had expected interest rates to rise at one point last automatic more recently before the election but that is off the agenda now. Why is it? It’s because of the big story in my life at the moment, the plaques -- collapsing oil price. The Bank of England said it good for 20 and could thereafter turned negative. -- fall to zero. It would be odd if the Bank of England pushed up interest rates in those circumstances, particularly because if interest rates went up it might cause employers to be a bit miserly with earnings increases. So as I say, the Bank of England, strong signal of no interest rate rise until the beginning of next year. Thank you, Robert. That’s all from the BBC News at Six. Tonight on BBC London News.

Coming up later in the programme: The man demanding an apology from Essex police after being sprayed in the face with CS gas. Two women have gone on trial charged with murdering an eight-year-old girl from east London. Ayshea Ali was living with her mother and her mother’s partner in Chadwell Heath when she died in August 2013. The Old Bailey heard how she’d suffered more than 50 injuries. Let’s get more from Daniel Boettcher who’s been following the case for us. The jury was told on the 29th of August 2013 paramedics were called to an address in Romford and the call had been made by one of the defendants,. She was living with another person and in her call, she said Miss Chowdhury had tried to kill herself and her daughter was dead. Emergency services around the body of the child, eight-year-old Tim 1-macro. She had more than 50 injuries including systems of-- including extensive bruising to her face. What was said in court about the relationship between the two defendants? The jury was told they became friends when they lived near each other and as friends when they lived near each otherand as their other and as their relationship it came closer, Miss Chowdhury’s marriage deteriorated and she and her husband separated. The QC said at the core is the relationship between them, to say their relationship was unconventional is a gross understatement. It was complex and involved fictional characters. It is alleged one of these characters was created. The prosecution said it appeared Polly Chowdhury fell in love with this made up character even though he was a fiction. Both women deny the charge of murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child. The trial will resume tomorrow. Unemployment may have fallen to its lowest level for more than six years. But with the UK still facing a shortage in engineering jobs, a computer firm has teamed up with University College London in a bid to encourage more young people to go into computing. Tech firm ARM is offering students an opportunity to develop their computer and coding skills, as Nick Beake reports. Plotting your career path is not always straightforward but these second-year electrical engineering students at UCL feel they are on track. They have been building their own robots and smart-phone apps which could be the next big thing. I’m wearing a heart monitor. I can monitor it on the phone. I can monitor it real term. It is hoped they could help the NHS but half of graduates are walking away from a job in engineering. In London you are used to the big city and you are going into banking because they offer big salaries. It is starting to change. They hope this can help. A new partnership between a tech company and the university. Students are given a kit to develop their own inventions. I have never developed an android app. It is great to do things on the side and it gets you to use your knowledge so you have the theory you learn in lectures but using it enhances that for me. They have not had the chance to work on such equipment, maybe something similar before. Never something sophisticated, easy-to-use and small. What difference will it make? I think it will make great engineers. This might be good fun if difficult to master but the sense of technology they are using and experimenting with is what is being used elsewhere to create some major innovations. For example, cars that drive themselves and park themselves. Engineering is a great subject. You can be an entrepreneur and start a company and there are lots of opportunities in engineering. This morning at an exhibition in east London, it was announced that Google and 02 would be among those delivering better computer lessons for primary school pupils. We want our young people to be inspired about the future. Coding, computing and programming is part of Britain’s future and making sure our young people take place in the modern world. The capital’s future success can be built on this. A man who had CS spray sprayed directly in his face by a police officer has been awarded £21,000. Essex Police made the payment to Alan Lethbridge in an out-of-court settlement five years after it happened. The incident in Brentwood was captured by a television cameraman. just to say, you may find some of the pictures in Debbie Tubby’s report upsetting. This is where Alan has spent most of his compensation. It will enable him to go back to work next week for the first time in five years. Since he was sprayed, he says he has suffered post-traumatic stress and has never received a police apology. It is a relief that it is finished with. It has been upsetting throughout the whole thing and I never got one apology. Did the solicitor push for the apology? Do you have to push for an apology or would it be common courtesy? This is Brentford high street in 2009. He is held across the bonnet of a police car. While handcuffed, he is sprayed with CS spray at close quarters by a police officer. He is then pulled to the ground. 24 hours after his arrest, he was released still wearing his blood-soaked T-shirt. Five years after a traumatic experience, it is a lot to go through. Depression and panic attacks I have had to put up with, they are still going on. The money doesn’t do itjustice. It wasn’t about the money, it was about the principle that I haven’t done anything in the first place. In july 2010 he was cleared of all charges. Today Essex Police say they will not apologise as the complaint was not upheld. The report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2010 recommended the force clarifies its policy on the use of CS spray and training is improved. I don’t think they want to admit they were in the wrong. He is an innocent man at the end of the day. I think he deserves that. I think that would help him with his everyday life. If they was to say sorry. That is all they have got to say, sorry. Alan says he has had to pay back half of his composition after claiming benefits for the last five years and he plans to appeal. Next- should dads avoid the delivery room? Now, it’s commonplace for fathers to be present at the birth of their baby. But new research from UCL and Kings College London suggests in some cases, it’s not so helpful and could even make labour more painful for their partners. Sonja jessup explains. Cuddles and play with mum today at this NCT group in Twickenham but everyone here has a different tale to tell about their baby’s birth. They agreed there were glad to have their partner by their side. I was induced for three days and I was in a great deal of pain. My husband had gone home and I wanted him to be there. When he was present, it was a great pain relief. Scientists were not monitoring people in labour but they wanted to measure pain levels from pin pricks to the finger. This woman who needed less intimacy in their relationship experience more pain when their partners were around. Whether it is childbirth or an operation, could it be that for some women, having the other half there might mean they perceive the pain to be worse? Maybe you deal with pain better when you are on your own. I think it is easier because you are making so many decisions during the labour process. Backin decisions during the labour process. Back in the 1940s, expectations were very different. Dad was more likely to be found down the pub than the delivery room but down the years, attitudes have changed. These days, it is expected debts will be at the birth. Even members of the Royal Family. It is important to have the husband thereto, are down, hold her hand and be a familiar face around. Perhaps it depends what kind of support is offered. Robbie Williams posted these pictures of him singing to his wife while she was in labour. I do recall saying to my husband, shut up, I am listening to the midwife. On the whole, I think it is an experience that the man should be part of. No regrets here but as these mum say, every birth and Kabul is different. joining me now is Professor Cathy Warwick, General Secretary of the Royal College of Midwives. We do hear this sort of view. What do you make of it because the woman in that report clearly say they wouldn’t have it any other way? It is brilliant of the fathers can be there to support their partners. My experience as a midwife is most men are fantastic at giving the women the emotional support they need. I was recently at a lovely birth where the woman was in a pool, the father was mopping her brow, supporting her. It was great. It would be a shame if research like this made people worry or do were discouraged from being in the delivery room. It would be a shame but what this highlights is it is a problem if people are stressed. What is very important is fathers get included in antenatal preparation, their fathers understand what is going to go on in the delivery room and that midwives talk to fathers about what they can do to support their partners. For some men, it is instinctive. For those that it isn’t, what advice do you give to an imminent father to be just before going into the delivery room? I would say, concentrate on your partner. I have seen men walk-in with a rolled up newspaper arm and sit and sit and read it in the corner. That really isn’t very helpful. Pay attention to the midwife, concentrate on your partner and we will look after you as well as her. Surely it is for the woman to decide. Thank you very much. We must leave it there but I am sure the discussion will continue. Still to come: Cashing in on the biggest TV costume drama in years. We take you to Wolf Hall. And we soon need a prisoner of war who walks from Poland into Germany. To football and Tottenham hope to take a step towards Wembley tonight. Spurs are in action against Sheffield United in the first leg of the League Cup semi-finals. We canjoin our sports reporter Chris Slegg who’s at White Hart Lane this evening and what’s the mood like? A lot of excitement among these fans arriving early to be this close to a Wembley cup final for six years. Some trepidation also because they are taking on a team who fear no one. Nigel Clough’s Sheffield United. He is the son of the late Brian Clough. Spurs also had a real scare the last time they were in the semifinal. They took on Burnley and one but away from home, they were saved by the quirky role in the League Cup that away goals only count after extra time. The head coachin count after extra time. The head coach in his first season here at Tottenham, they know they can take nothing for granted to night as they look to seize control ahead of the second leg in Yorkshire next Wednesday. We know Sheffield is a very good team. In this competition, it is not in Wharton to play in the Premier League. We need to show respect for Sheffield United and be focused. It is a very important game and a semifinal. That is tonight and in the semifinal-- and in the other semifinal, Chelsea are on track for Wembley. A great game last night. Chelsea took the lead against Liverpool from the penalty spot. Liverpool got level. An individual goal from Raheem Sterling. It ended 1-1. Chelsea had the advantage because they are at home at Stamford Bridge next Tuesday that that tie is in a balanced ahead of the second leg. At Tottenham will be hoping they can take advantage of lower league opponents and stay on course for what they hope will be a London derby in the League Cup final at Wembley on March one. You can hear live commentary on this match on BBC London. Kick off is at 7:45pm. 70 years ago today, 96-year-old Londoner Robbie Clark started a journey he will never forget. Known as the Long March it happened in 1945 when 80,000 prisoners of war were forced to march over 1000 miles over three months in bitter winter conditions. Robbie was one of those who marched and Emilia Papadopoulos met him today. ~ Ididn’t I didn’t realise I had survived so much punishment. So much pain, so much hunger. Robbie Clark never forgets the 21st ofjanuary. It was on this Day 70 years ago that he began the longest walk of his life. As one of the 80,000 British prisoners of war forced to march for than 1000 miles across a frozen Eastern Europe. It wasjune 21st, 1942. Midsummer ‘s day, I remember it well. That was the day he was captured by the Nazis and was held in a prison camp for three years until Hitler ordered all prisoners back to Germany. I called it the death march. You just used to march and March with gods either side of you. Some of the fellows were so weak, theyjust fell. Put into groups of a hundred, they were forced to walk up to 20 miles a day in the brutal winter conditions. 35,000 people were taken prisoner and we were reduced to the last 1000. Robbie was liberated by American troops in 1845 anti-documented his ordeal in this tiny diary but even without it, the memories are still vivid. It was a Booker Prize winning novel, a critically acclaimed West End play, and tonight the highly anticipated TV adaptation of Wolf Hall starts on BBC Two. Damian Lewis plays Henry VIII, opposite Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell, in this latest version of Hilary Mantel’s historical drama. And with much of the action taking place at Hampton Court, the Tudor palace is already cashing in on the story’s popularity. Sarah Harris reports. Cromwell. Why are you such a person? The actor Mark Rylance plays the central character in the BBC’s adaptation of the Booker Prize Tudor novels by Hilary Mantel. Wolf Hall shows the rise of political player Thomas Cromwell. The series director says it was important to use authentic buildings in the shoot. The only problem with shooting in a place like that was that every 20 minutes, a tour party would pass through. This was the deal we had to strike. Actors of the statue of Damian Lewis, Mark Rylance and jonathan Pryce in full costume, candles lit, stopping every 20 minutes so 50 or 60 oAPs couldn’t walk through with a torch. There are landmarks all over the capital which played a backdrop to the real story of the man who was said to be the first political spin doctor. The story of Thomas Cromwell is very much a London one and it begins in Putney in 1485. He was the son of a brewer and a blacksmith. He was one of the most influential politicians of all time. The shop at Hampton Court is stocked in anticipation of merchandise once the series is broadcast. Tracy says no one else compares when it comes to telling the story. Hampton Court is a place like no other in terms of getting a sense of the Tudor period. It is very much unchanged since Cromwell’s day and you can imagine him plotting in this labyrinth of a court with so many different rooms that he and the king would have progressed through. It is extraordinary and you get a sense of the real Wolf Hall here. Make his case. I can see you are really busy. Critics say this could be the greatest period drama ever made and there is no doubt 500 years on the ferocious political stories are as intriguing as ever. Now the Weather with Stav Danaos. It has been a cold day across our region. We have seen some light rain and some sleet and snow. Some of that may roll further westwards as we have through the rest of this evening and into the first part of the night. We could have a dusting for Essex. It will clear away and will not amount to much. Temperatures will plummet down to freezing. Central parts of London will hover at one Celsius. We start tomorrow morning on a cold note. There will be some cloud around and the cloud is breaking up through the day. Some sunny spells are developing. It will be another chilly one with temperatures around five Celsius.

It now stands at 1.91 million, its lowest level for more than six years. Tony Blair has denied suggestions that he’s responsible for the delays to the publication of the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war. It won’t now be released until after the general election. More on the day’s stories on our website. So from all of us here, thanks for watching and have a lovely evening. My name is Harry Leslie Smith. I was born in 1923 in Barnsley. Back then, there was no social healthcare. My oldest sister Marian contracted tuberculosis... ..when she was four. And... ..it gradually got worse and worse over the years. My mum did her best to take care of her. In the end, although my mother regretted doing it, she said to my dad, ""We will have to take her to the workhouse infirmary. ""I just can’t manage any more."" She died in that infirmary. When I went back... ..to England in1948, I’d extended my service in the Air Force, the NHS was opening. The very fact that I could walk in there, see a doctor and walk out without paying a penny, that was... it was a miracle. I’m Charlotte, I’m a registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology. I’ve been working in the NHS for five years now. I feel really, really proud to work for the NHS. It does great things every day for so many people. I’m really concerned about the future of the NHS, how more stretched it is every day. Cuts are being made and people are frustrated, they can’t go to their GP, so they end up going to A&E. If it continues as it is, the NHS as we know it won’t exist any more. The NHS is notjust important, it is essential, and a healthy society means a healthy country. But it’s really important to me what it’s going to look like, for us right now and for future generations. I don’t want my past to become Britain’s future. We must make sure that the NHS will continue for you, your children and hopefully your grandchildren. A different government would make different choices. Labour will guarantee 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, 5,000 more care workers, a GP appointment within 48 hours, no-one will wait more than one week for a cancer test and result. The NHS provides hope and security for all of us. And that’s why we must protect the NHS.

199,BBC1 London,21-jan-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at ten, cigarettes will have to be sold in plain packaging in England by May of next year. It’s long been a goal of health campaigners. Legislation will be presented in the coming weeks and will become law before the election. The change to standardised packaging would apply in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would have to consider their own changes. This this is a victory for common sense and a victory for public health and it has only happened because of strong support from the public and from parliamentarians across all parties. The plans were announced this evening, taking observers by surprise, we’ll have details and reaction. Also tonight, Tony Blair says it’s not his fault that the inquiry into the Iraq War will not publish its findings until after the election. The most important thing is that it should be immune from pressure from any quarter. Average earnings have risen, while unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in six years. The head of BP says that oil prices could stay at low levels for another three years. And, just five of them left in the world, we report on the endangered Northern White rhino. Later on BBC London, the man who claims he was left brain damaged after taking part in a drugs trial. And the tech firm which has teamed up with a London university, to help more graduates get into computing. Good evening. Cigarettes will have to be sold in plain, standardised packaging in England by May of next year according to a ministerial statement tonight. Legislation will be laid before Parliament in the coming weeks and should become law before the election. The regulations would only apply in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would have to approve their own changes. At present, Australia is the only country in the world which enforces plain packaging for tobacco products. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym has the story. This is what is meant by plain packaging for tobacco, alarming messages about the health risks of smoking and only a very small indication of the brand. It is already in force in Australia and seems set to become law in the UK in the next few months. In a highly significant move, health Minister tonight unveiled the planned in the Commons. This government is committed to protecting children from harm tobacco causes so we will be bringing forward legislation for standardised packaging before the end of this Parliament. It really puts you off it. The main aim is to deter children from smoking, it has been argued youngsters are more likely to be attracted to tobacco by: Bill, branded packaging than by plain packets with graphic messages -- by colourful packaging. This idea was proposed in 2010 at momentum slowed. The plan is set to become law before the election subject to a parliamentary vote and would probably take effect in May 2016th. This is what the Department of Health proposes racquets will look like. But Parliament could suggest changes -- like. But Parliament could suggest changes -- packets. The government carried out a consultation before deciding to formally press ahead with his radical move in the campaign to reduce smoking. Labour welcomed the move but said it had taken far too long. We have had countless consultations and U-turns, an independent review and now I’m glad the government has finally assessed the evidence and said they will bring forward this measure. Anti-smoking campaigners were delighted with the developments. This is a victory for public health and common-sense and it has only happened because of support across all parties. The government has decided to go ahead because of strong popular support and support from all political parties and it’s a no-brainer. But that was hostile reaction from the smokers group, Forest, which said the government was taking a huge risk because there was evidence of increased illicit trade although ministers dispute this. While it may have been widely welcomed, the plan will still be on the virtual in some quarters. Hugh Pym is with me now. They talk about some surprise in Parliament this evening but it has been a long campaign. Yes, health campaigners say this is a momentous because after several years of debate, accusations of the government going cool on the idea and about bike MPs in favour last spring, then a review and a consultation period, everything appearing to go quiet, tonight and -- everything appearing to go quiet, tonight and -- Minister tells the Commons that legislation will be put forth Holloman. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own vote -- put before Parliament. But there are still uncertainties, the threat of legal action. This is bad news for the tobacco companies and ministers anticipate that is possible so although it may get on the statute book, how and when it is implement it, there will still be uncertainty over that. The former Prime Minister Tony Blair has firmly denied suggestions that he is in some way responsible for the delay in publishing the findings of the Chilcot Inquiry. The public inquiry into Britain’s role in the Iraq War was commissioned in 2009. Sirjohn Chilcot said today he could not give an accurate assessment of how long it will take to complete the report as our Deputy Political Editor james Landale explains. Tonight, British servicemen and women are engaged from air, land and sea. It was a war that began 12 years ago. A war that ousted a brutal dictator. A war that cost the lives of thousands. The decision by Tony Blair and George Bush to invade Iraq remains controversial. For the families of the 179 British soldiers who died, it is a decision they live with every day. Debi Allbutt’s husband, Stephen, died in 2003 when his tank was hit by another British tank, just days after the invasion began. After 12 years, you know, there’s people, including myself, who want answers and the answers don’t come. So, you know, we want to know why they went out there. Why did they go out that quickly? It makes you wonder- because they haven’t come out with a reason why - it makes you wonder exactly why they are delaying it until after the election. Is there some political gain in that? Sirjohn Chilcot’s inquiry has already taken five years. Delayed by illness, rows over what material should be published, and the long process of giving people the chance to respond to potential criticism. I put out a statement, you can go and see it. One of those under scrutiny is Tony Blair. Today, he denied that he was adding to any delay, nor was he opposing the publication of his private notes to President Bush. When he spoke to the BBC, he couldn’t hide his impatience. I’ve just told you, I’ve put out a statement. So you can go and read the statement. I’m frustrated it’s not been published some time ago. Because after all, for people like myself, and, you know, when this inquiry finally comes out, gives me also, frankly, an opportunity to go out and say, this is why I did what I did and this is why I believed that it was the right thing to do. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Sirjohn Chilcot confessed that he couldn’t give an accurate estimate to how long it will take to complete his work. ""But it is clear that will take some further months."" David Cameron said he was frustrated, but couldn’t hurry what is an independent inquiry. I don’t believe, from what I understand, that anyone is trying to dodge this report or put off this report, we all want to see it, but you do have to go through the proper processes. The inquiry was established six years ago after our combat operations had ended and, frankly, my views on the Iraq war are well-known and I want this inquiry published. Others who also opposed the war in Iraq said the delay was incomprehensible. The public will start thinking, whether it’s true or not, that the report will pull its punches, that it’s going to be, sort of, sexed down, if you like. We often remember our war dead long after we’ve forgotten what caused the war in which they died and that’s why the Chilcot report matters. Some people have long made up their minds over the Iraq war, but others still want to know what happened and why. British servicemen and women spent six years fighting in Iraq. Finding out why they did will take a little longer. james Landale, BBC News in Whitehall. Unemployment has fallen again and earnings have risen according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The number of people out of work in the UK is now at a six-year low, down by 58,000 in the three months to November to 1.91 million. The unemployment rate now stands at 5.8%, though there are significant variations around the UK. And wages are outstripping inflation, with average earnings increasing by 1.8%. Our economics correspondent Andy Verity investigates the nature of the jobs recovery. Back in September, Sherika Sherard showed the world just how determined she was to find work and the world listened. Her song scored more than 20,000 hits on YouTube and then she got the call offering her work as a supermarket fishmonger. It was quite life changing. It meant that I was actually working towards something, being part of society and working a job and also, again, making my CV better. But begging for a job is becoming less and less necessary. Not only have half a million people found work in the last year, there are now 700,000 job vacancies, more than there have been since 2001. Across industry, that’s giving skilled workers especially a stronger hand when they negotiate their pay. Tight labour markets and skill shortages might seem like bad news if you’re an employer, but if you’re the person whose skills are in demand, it can be very good news. Because firms have to compete to get your skills on board, your wages can rise rapidly. In the slump, there were too many bricklayers for the work and at a site like this one in Norwich, they’d be lucky to get £100 a day, but now there are too few and their pay has shot up to £150. It’s all to do with supply and demand, if there’s no one buying houses, the prices are going to go down. The same with oil, no one wants it, the prices stay low. People want it, they shoot up. It’s supply and demand and we’re wanted. A college nearby is trying to meet that demand for skilled workers by training young people, among whom unemployment is still rising. They can earn anything from £20,000 to £50,000 as a skilled joiner and the college is trebling the numbers on its construction course. If you’re got a trade under your belt you’re pretty much sorted, you can work anywhere in the world if you’re good at what you do. You can do whatever you want, really. Behind the falling unemployment is a big regional variation. It’s down fastest in the West Midlands where 34,000 newjobs are created but in Wales, it rose in the three months to November by 9000 and in Scotland it also went up by 7000. Economists used to insist that if unemployment got too low, inflation would shoot up an interest rate would have to rise toward that off. Not any more. In the late summer I was sure we would see one by the end of 2011+ and then along came the huge fall in the oil price, down by half, so it became much harderfor the Bank of England to consider putting rates up. And now I think they probably will wait the thick end of the year before anything changes. With inflation tumbling towards zero, no one on the Bank of England’s interest-rate setting committee is now voting for a rate rise. We can go now to Davos where our economic editor is. One set of indicators but what are they saying they’re about the state of the European economy and the potential impact on the UK? Britain, like America, still appears to be doing pretty well... That America, still appears to be doing pretty well. .. That was pretty well... That was a shame, hopefully we might get that back in a few minutes but I’m sorry about that. If we get him back, I will bring him back on but we can move on to another story. The First Minister of Scotland has told the BBC that the SNP will vote at Westminster on issues affecting the health service in England. Usually, the SNP only takes part in Commons votes which have a direct impact on Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon told our political editor, Nick Robinson, that the new approach would be necessary to protect the NHS in Scotland. As they sometimes say in Scotland, here’s something that might really do your head in. Even though the referendum is long since over, even though Scots did not vote yes, Nicola Sturgeon, the First here, but in the rest of the UK too. The SNP has been signing up thousands of new members, many of them women. It’s great to have such a positive role model for girls and women to look up to. The party now has double Labour’s support in the polls, which could bring them enough new MPs to hold the balance of power at Westminster. She claims they’d help Ed Miliband into NumberTen, but how? I guess I’m instinctively not too enthusiastic about formal coalitions. Never say never and let’s see what happens. I guess I tend more towards an arrangement that’s on a vote by vote basis rather than a formal coalition, but people have the vote first and let’s see how they vote. It is her government, not David Cameron’s, which runs the NHS in Scotland, but just listen to this. We would be prepared to vote on matters of English health because that has a direct impact, potentially, on Scotland’s budget so if there was a vote in the House of Commons to repeal the privatisation of the health service that has been seen in England, to restore the National Health Service, we would vote for that. You have control of the Scottish health service, here in the Scottish Government, a Scottish First Minister and you’re saying to English voters, we will come down south and vote on your health service. I suspect a lot of English voters would like to see an end to the privatisation of the English health service, but that’s a separate issue. This is the man elected to stop her, Labour’s new Scottish leader, jim Murphy. This is my city, I love Glasgow. He is desperately trying to reverse the plunge in his party’s standing and warning Scots they could get a Tory Government without meaning to. Most people in Scotland know the big challenge and the big decision is how to get rid of David Cameron out of Downing Street and I know, asl meet many SNP voters who are thinking of voting for that party again, the last thing they want is David Cameron re-elected by accident. Many Scots want what they think is best of both worlds, a Labour government in Westminster, but backed up by the SNP. The Scottish Labour Party will stand up for Scotland’s interest. The Scottish Labour Party is changing, we are changing our constitution, the way in which we are working, we are confident and patriotic. If Labour don’t recover fast, he could be back. Alex Salmond hopes to lead an army of new SNPs down from Scotland to Westminster. It won’t be you that’s top dog in the SNP any more, it will be Alex Salmond. Well, I’ll the leader of the SNP and the First Minister of Scotland... He’ll be deciding who the Prime Minister is, what the policies in Westminster are... The SNP operates as a team, we always have and we always will. The Scottish referendum already feels like quite a long time ago but the truth is, its legacy means tha the battle over Scottish politics could become the battle over who runs Britain. Nick Robinson, BBC News, Glasgow. In Florida, the woman accusing Prince Andrew of sexual misconduct has filed new documents in court repeating the claims. The Prince and Buckingham Palace have consistently denied the allegations. Our correspondent, Rajini Vaidyanathan, is at the court in West Palm Beach. What can you tell us? Well, this is the first time thatjean Doe number three has provided her version of events to the courts. Over several pages, and crucially in her own words, she reasserts the claim that will she was forced to have sexual relations with Prince Andrew, on three separate occasions, including once at an or gill. One line from the documents reads, ""I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but Ijust called him, Andy."" Her lawyers say that they sent a letter to Prince Andrew asking him to respond under oath to the allegations, but they say that that letter was sent back to them. Now, tonight, Buckingham Palace say they have nothing to add to earlier comments in which they in factically denied that the Prince had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virgina Roberts. All of this comes on the eve of a planned public appearance by Prince Andrew in Davos, where he’s due to host an event for entrepreneurs. Thank you for the update there from the court in Florida. The Head of BP, Bob Dudley, says that oil prices could remain low for up to three years. He suggested that petrol prices in Britain could fall below £1 a litre. Mr Dudley is one of dozens of global business leaders at the World Economic Forum, in the Swiss resort of Davos, where he spoke to our business editor, Kamal Ahmed. The plunging price of global oil isn’t a blip, and that will mean some tough decisions for the North Sea. The head of one of the world’s largest energy firms believes that low prices are here to stay. I think that we have got to plan on this being down. We don’t know exactly what level, but certainly a year, I think probably two or maybe three years. You’re going to see stress in some countries that are producing countries. Scotland is going to be under some stress with these low oil prices. I lived there in 1986, I saw what happened then, I know how difficult it can be. The 1980s oil crisis did pass and employment roared back. This time though it might be tougher. At the time of the last Davos meeting, the price of a barrel of oil was well over $100 and nobody was predicting the spectacular collapse that followed. It is now below $50 a barrel. The Head of BP has said the Government must now act to protect jobs and services in the North Sea. My input would be, provide some incentives to keep the investment going, so it doesn’t stop. Make sure that smaller fields around the infrastructure can be tied in because if it goes too long, and the oil price is too low, it gets too expensive to go back and get it. Despite industry pessimism on the oil price, other experts say there could be better news ahead. I believe this low oil prices, the $1+5 prices what we hear today, is a temporary phenomenon and we will see, towards the end of 2015, upward pressure on the prices which will make the fields such as the North Sea and others again profitable. What doesn’t appear too profit, so far at least, is Britain’s much predicted shale gas revolution. Today, council officials in Lancashire rejected proposals for two test wells after protests. By the time that revolution gets going, few would hazard a guess at where the turbulent world of oil prices might be. KamalAhmed, BBC News, Davos. President Obama has said that after 15 hard years - including the financial crisis and two wars - it was time to ""turn the page."" In his penultimate State of the Union address, he urged Congress to work with him to cut taxes for families by taking more from higher earners. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, reports. The President of the United States! Barack Obama walked into Congress last night to wild applause and cheering, well at least from the Democrats he did. Despite losing badly in the midterms, this was a reenergised President, full of confidence, defiance even, as he trumpeted the turning round of the US economy. It has been and still is a hard time for many. But tonight we turn the page. Tonight, after a breakthrough yearfor America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. In his final two years of office, he sounded like a man liberated from ever having to fight an election ever again. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda... MILD LAUGHTER. I know, because I won both of them! APPLAUSE. But look at the man on the right of screen. He’sjohn Boehner, the Republican Leader of the House, and his facial reactions suggested that he was sucking on a particularly sour sweet. His official response came today. All the President really offered last night was more taxes, more government, more of the same approach that has failed the middle class for decades. This is the argument that will run between now and the Presidential elections of November 2016, as Republicans and Democrats battle it out for control of the White House, somewhere in this blizzard behind me. What Barack Obama was trying to do is set the terms of the debate that will allow another Democrat to keep control. Hillary Clinton will have been listening carefully. The former Secretary of State wasn’t there last night, but over the coming weeks and months it is thought that she and a slew of potential candidates will reveal their ambitions to succeed this man. john Sopel, BBC News, Washington. The northern white rhino is on the brink of extinction, there are just five of them left in the world, according to conservationists. The animal has been hunted by poachers for decades and experts are desperately trying to find a way to save the few that remain. Our science editor, David Shukman, has been given rare access to report on one of the last survivors. The quiet lonely shuffle of a giant animal facing extinction. One of the last five of a particular type of rhino, the northern white. It’s in a zoo in the Czech Republic which over the years has built up one of the largest collections of animals from Africa. This kind of rhino no longer exists in the wild because the horns that make them famous are highly prized by poachers. There are three northern white rhinos in Kenya, but they’re guarded in a park, and they’re not reproducing. The last birth anywhere in the world was 15 years ago, so there’s a real risk that this species will soon join the others that human activity has wiped out. You could witness them dying out one by one and if you realise this, it’s really a desperate situation and I personally really do not want to witness these animals die outjust like this in a few coming years. The zoo has gone to extraordinary lengths to try to encourage more offspring. It’s quite a task hoisting a rhino weighing more than a tonne into the air. Repeated attempts at artificial insemination have all come to nothing and every procedure comes with dangers. When you’re this close to a massive northern white rhino, you realise just how difficult any technique for assisted reproduction is going to be because there are risks. In one operation here, a rhino died. In another, a keeper was killed. But with just five of these animals left, this may be the last chance. So scientists are exploring all the options. At this research centre in Berlin, they use scanners to gain a better understanding of endangered animals. The specialists believe there are techniques that could save the northern white rhinos. Stored in liquid nitrogen are samples of sperm from one of the rhinos. They want to collect eggs, as well, in the hope of trying IVF. Beyond that, there are more radical ideas, fusing tissue samples, including this one, to produce stem cells that could make embryos to bring the animals back from extinction some time in the future. These samples stay alive for 3,000 years. So we hope we need only a few years to find technologies which we can use to create babies out of these cells. Sometimes science can head off extinction. Giant pandas were helped, but there were still enough of them to avoid inbreeding. By contrast, Lonesome George, the famous Galapagos giant tortoise, was the last of his line and died two years ago. Back in the zoo, IVF might be tried and it may work or the northern white rhinos will slip away, at a time when many other animals are also on the brink of extinction. David Shukman, BBC News, in the Czech Republic. That’s all from us. Don’t forget Newsnight is over on BBC Two. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good night. Good evening and welcome, I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. A man from Slough is preparing to take on a pharmaceutical giant in the high court, claiming he was left brain damaged after taking part in a drugs trial. Adrian Hailer hoped the drug would help to manage his blood disorder. Now his wife says they’re in ""a living hell"" - spending their life savings on 21+-hour care. Novartis, the company that makes the drug, says it’s been used successfully worldwide and insists the change in his condition is not a result of the trial. Katharine Carpenter reports. At the age of 77, Adrian Hailer has had to teach himself to read again. But the struggle to speak is his greatest frustration. A former priest and avid walker, he and his wife were enjoying an active retirement despite a blood condition he had been living with for over 15 years. Then he agreed to take part in a drugs trial to help alleviate his symptoms. The trial was being run by the pharmaceutical giant Novartis and in the summer of 2012, Mr Hailer came here to Hammersmith Hospital to begin treatment. But within two months, his wife felt something was wrong. He kept on consistently saying the opposite to what he meant and I said to him, you’re doing it and he said, oh, it’sjust the advancing years, it doesn’t matter. But it wasn’tjust occasionally, it was regularly. And the other one was the inability to follow directions. That became quite frightening. Within weeks he was hospitalised having suffered what his lawyers describe as a catastrophic brain injury. They claim the trial drug compromised his immune system, leaving him vulnerable to a viral infection ",,
