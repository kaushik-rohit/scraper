1,BBC1 London,6-jun-2015,BBC News,12:00,10 mins,True,"Good afternoon. David Cameron will urge world leaders at the G7 summit this weekend to tackle corruption in governments and organisations across the globe. Mr Cameron will use the meeting in Germany to push for greater co-operation between international bodies such as the United Nations. Our Political Correspondent Alan Soadyjoins me. Interesting that the Prime Minister is pursuing this? David Cameron ‘s argument is that corruption is wrong and it can damage economies and trickle down to damage the living standards of people who are living in those countries. Now the Prime Minister has raised this issue before, he says it is something he’s passionate about. The difference todayis passionate about. The difference today is that this is the first time he’s linking it to the Fifa scandal, his argument at the G7 is that if corruption can be rooted out in world football then surely it can be rooted out in governments the world. Whether we are talking about bribery, whether we are talking about misusing international aid money. There are pressure groups that say it could be progress if this is talked about but actually turning it into effective action is something much or difficult. The other difficulty David Cameron may have here is that there are plenty of other big topics on the agenda at this G7 Summit. Whether it is relations with Russia, on things like climate change. Almost certainly they will want to talk about the financial crisis in Greece. There is a risk that this issue of corruption could be squeezed. Thank you forjoining us. A safer test for Down’s syndrome that reduces the risk of miscarriage could soon be available on the NHS. One in every 200 women loses her baby when the fluid around the developing foetus is tested for genetic disorders. The new blood test, which is currently being trialled, could greatly reduce the need for invasive procedures. Our Health Reporterjames Gallagher has the details. A glimpse inside the womb. Every pregnant woman is offered an ultrasound scan like this to help her to assess the risk of Down’s syndrome. The genetic disorder can lead to learning disability and affects around 750 babies each year. But those at high risk are offered this, an amniocentesis. It is a needle which is used to extract fluid from around the tiny foetus. Here at Great Ormond Street they have been piloting a safer test, scientists are examining blood for the tiny segments of DNA which end up in the mother’s bloodstream. It allows the team to detect genetic anomalies and reduce the number of women needing invasive testing. It is a much more accurate test, 99% accurate, it reduces the number of tests significantly, reducing the number of invasive tests required by more than 80%. The blood test is expensive but doctors hope they could save money by cutting the number of amniocentesis operations. The UK’s national screening committee will begin to assess the idea this month. Police are continuing to question four Polish lorry drivers about the discovery of 68 suspected illegal immigrants in four vehicles in Harwich. 15 children and two pregnant women were among the group discovered by border officials - following the arrival of a ferry from the Netherlands yesterday. Four rollercoasters at three theme parks in the UK remain closed after an accident at Alton Towers earlier this week. The Smiler rollercoaster and a similar ride at Thorpe Park will both be shut for the foreseeable future, along with two rides at Chessington World of Adventures. Four people remain in hospital after the crash between two carriages on Tuesday. Pope Francis has arrived in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo for a brief visit. The purpose of the trip is to encourage the dwindling number of Catholics to stay in country - and help create a peaceful future with Bosnia’s Muslims and Orthodox Christians after the war of the 1990s. Chinese authorities have said they now believe 396 people died when a ferry capsized on the Yangtze River on Monday. The number has risen dramatically after emergency crews searched the cabins of the Eastern Star, which has been hoisted from the water by huge cranes. From Beijing, Celia Hatton reports. Finally, the Eastern Star has been righted and hoisted out of the water, and rescuers have been able to get inside. The grim search for victims continues. A large number of the crew ship’s passengers were thought to have been asleep in their rooms when the ship suddenly capsized. Workers are concentrating on the top floors of the ship where the cabins were located. They say damage to the ship ‘s interior is slowing work. For the relatives of the victims it is an agonising wait. They say they have not been told which of the victims bodies have been found. Orwhere which of the victims bodies have been found. Or where their remains are being held. Many are furious with the government. TRANSLATION: There was no information, everyday we are procrastinating and wasting time. A meeting between local authorities and the families resulted bitter arguments. One woman fainted and had to be carried away. Here at the local school at the town closest to the rescue site, an attempt to honour the lives lost. Children hanging yellow ribbons on their school gates, a traditional display of prey as for the deceased. Inspired by the children, the town 's residents have covered the town with ribbons, a small act of compassion to mark China’s worst maritime disaster in living history. 11 climbers and guides have died after an earthquake near Malaysia’s highest peak. Eight people are missing on Borneo. The earthquake which hadn’t -- missing on Borneo. The earthquake which hadn’t -- had a magnitude of six trapped climbers on the mountain for several hours. And finally Andy Murray’s in action in the semi finals of the French Open in Paris. Play’s just got underway at Roland Garros - his match against Novak Djokavic was suspended yesterday due to rain. Play resumed with Murray two sets to one down, and three games all in the fourth set. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. The next news on BBC One is at 7.15. From me, goodbye. Good afternoon. After yesterday ‘s heat and thunderstorms today it is a fresher feel. Through the weekend in fact we will have a fresher feeling. With sunshine but also strong winds. Particularly in the North. In the north we have this low pressure, plenty of showers in Northern Ireland and Scotland and the North West. This is the windiest of the conditions, blustery showers in the north, further south not so windy. Still fairly breezy. Looking at lipm, the numbers in the black circles are the wind speed. 40-50 mph. Particularly in higher parts of the Southern uplands. In the East, fewer showers. 11-14 degrees in the Northwest. Moving south, sunshine dominating in the South East. Highs in London of around 20 degrees. For the Derby, 18 degrees or so and it should be dry but quite breezy. Looking like a dry evening in Berlin for the Champions League final with temperatures around 24 degrees, feeling quite humid. Closer to home, this wind will ease away this evening and overnight. Gradually turning less windy. Showers will be easing. A couple continuing over Scotland but elsewhere under clear skies it will be quite chilly. 8-9 in the cities, but in the countryside it will be a few degrees below. Less windy tomorrow, much improved from Northern Ireland, fewer showers and less windy over Scotland. England and Wales will have sunny spells but Fairweather cloud keeping things hazy. 13-21 degrees. High-pressure is holding on as we looked through the week ahead, dry weather and sunshine. 20 degrees in the south. Further north, temperatures below what we would ",,

The athlete Mo Farah has said he wants answers from his coach, Alberto Salazar, about allegations made in a BBC documentary that Mr Salazar was involved in banned doping practices. Speaking publicly for the first time about the issue, the double Olympic Gold medallist says he’s standing by his coach, but that if the allegations prove true, he’ll be the ""first to leave"" him. No claims of doping have been made against Mo Farah. Angus Crawford’s report contains flash photography. Mo Farah winning gold at the London Olympics. Behind him taking silver close friend and training partner, the American Rupp. Alberto Salazar trained them both, former marathon star, now champion coach. A BBC documentary reported claims he had been involved in banned doping practices which including supplying Rupp with testosterone when he was 16. Mo Farah hasn’t been accused of any wrong-doing. Ahead of a race in Birmingham tomorrow he said he won’t drop Salazar though he does want answers. I spoke to Alberto Salazar last night. I got on the phone and I said to him, what’s going on? I said to him, I need some answers. He goes, I can prove this to you. These are just allegations. goes, I can prove this to you. These arejust allegations. I’ll are just allegations. I’ll show you some evidence. I say OK. I have a big race this weekend. Farah moved to the project in the US in 2011 for the state-of-the-art facilities and Salazar’s expertise. He became double world an Olympic champion and one of Britain’s greatest sporting figures. A reputation he fears has been tarnished. It’s not about me, it’s about Alberto Salazar. At the same time my name is getting dragged through the mud. It’s not fair. I’m angry. I need answers. Iwant through the mud. It’s not fair. I’m angry. I need answers. I want to know as soon as possible. As for his friend, Rupp. He is yet to hear from him. When I’m lining up against him Ihave to him. When I’m lining up against him I have to beat him. He needs to answer questions. Alberto Salazar has been a consultant for UK Athletics since 2013. It says it has had no concerns about his coaching methods but is launching a review. The easy decision would have been to say - The easy decision would have been to say - let’s walk away. The right decision is - say - let’s walk away. The right decision is - you have to prove these allegations are not founded. If you can’t prove that, we will walk away. Alberto Salazar and Rupp have strongly denied all the accusations against them. Mo Farah has today put his coach on notice to clear his own name or lose his star athlete. Angus Crawford, BBC News. David Cameron is urging an international crackdown on what he’s called the ""cancer"" of corruption, in the wake of the Fifa bribery allegations. He’ll use the G7 meeting in Germany this weekend to call for a world-wide effort to clean-up government and business. This afternoon, there were clashes near the summit venue between anti-G7 protestors and police. Our political correspondent, Ross Hawkins, reports. When the real heads of the G7 governments arrive at summits like this one, David Cameron thinks they don’t talk enough about corruption. As Sepp Blatter’s walked away from the presidency of Fifa, denying wrong-doing, the Prime Minister says we’ve seen appalling allegations that suggest football’s governing body is riddled with corruption and now there’s a chance to say more about the problem on a global scale, one that’s estimated to cost 5% of all the goods and services produced worldwide, with $1 trillion paid in bribes each year all adding 10% to the cost of doing business. But stating the problem at a well policed summit is the easy bit. Change is much harder. Cameron’s quite right to focus on corruption. You go to any poor country in the world they’ll tell you it’s up there in the top three issues that need to be dealt with. But it’s one thing to say, do it, it’s another thing to deal with it in your own backyard. Cameron needs to lead the G7 this weekend in some concrete actions to deal with tax dodging. Clashes and pepper spray outside the venue today. Officials aren’t promising results inside or even a mention of corruption in the final statement agreed by leaders. With so many other demands, the problem won’t be solved in two days in the Alps. Let’s go live now to Germany and our diplomatic correspondent, james Robbins. james, what are the key issues here? What is up for discussion? Well, it’s true to say that David Cameron will get a sympathetic hearing on consider corruption, but the leaders have an enormous range of present threats that they want to deal with. I think they’ll probably trump corruption. The continuing threat from President Putin of Russia. He isn’t here because Russia was kicked out of this club for his actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Angela Merkel wants to see strong language directed towards Russia, particularly because she, the Americans, the British are determined to keep the EU together, backing and continuing with sanctions against President Putin. One other thing I will mention. Chancellor Merkel idea that much greater action needs to be taken to strengthen global health systems to combat pandemics like ebola. You will see a strong statement on that with real concrete action. Many thanks, james Robbins. A new, safer test for Down’s Syndrome may soon be available on the NHS. The procedure reduces the number of women who need an amniocentesis, where a needle is inserted into the womb. Currently, one in 200 women who have the amniocentesis test miscarries their baby. Sangita Myska reports. When Shelley was pregnant with her son, Sam, who is now nine, she was told that he would be born with down syndrome. She continued with the pregnant i, but the test confirmed the Down’s diagnosis nearly took that decision out of her hands. We had the amniocentesis exam and we found out he had Down’s Syndrome. Afterwards my waters started leaking and I had early signs of labour much we had to face the fact we might lose him because we had had amniocentesis. During an amniocentesis fluid around a fee 'tis is tested for genetic disorders, it carries a risk. Women are offered the test, doctors are checking for an increased amount of chromosome 21. For one in 200 women that test can result in a miss carriage. A new blood test for pregnant women could reduce the number of those needing an amniocentesis. It screens fragments of foetal DNA that pass into a woman’s bloodstream. It’s 99% accurate for Down’s Syndrome. In our study in reduced the number of tests required by more than 80%. Scientists described this new blood test as a breakthrough. It’s already being used in around 100 countries. The trial at this hospital is to see whether or not it can be rolled out on the NHS. It’s already concluded thatit on the NHS. It’s already concluded that it could help patients become better informed and prove cost effective. Shelley welcomes the blood test and adds that having Sam has been a happy fulfilling experience for her whole family. The NHS has yet to decide if the test will be available for mothers to be. Tennis, and despite a heroic fight-back at the French Open yesterday, Andy Murray this afternoon lost his semi-final match against the World Number One, Novak Djokovic. In the Women’s Final, Serena Williams clinched her 20th Grand Slam singles title. Adam Wild was watching. Finals weekend. One of tennis’ great destinations.

The British Number One beginning where he left off, aggressive, focussed, determined. A comeback rapidly appearing into view, Murray had the break, forcing yet another error. He had the fourth set, too. Level once more, but Djokovic would not let things slip again. Murray’s renewed hope faded to frustration. Murray’s French Open ",,

We were about to leave and then the best thing happened. We were about to leave and the door moved. ""Did you press it?"" ""I didn’t press it."" ""OK.""

David Cameron is urging an international crackdown on what he’s called the ‘cancer’ of corruption, in the wake of the Fifa bribery allegations. He’ll use the G7 meeting in Germany this weekend to call for a worldwide effort to clean up government and business. This afternoon, there were scuffles near the summit This afternoon, there were scuffles nearthe summit venue, near the summit venue, between protestors and police, as thousands demonstrated against the meeting. Let’s go live now to Germany, and our Diplomatic Correspondent, james Robbins. We know that’s one of the key thing is David Cameron wants to talk about. Give us a sense of the wider issues Mac at play, what is on the agenda? It is clear that David Cameron Walker December that it hearing for his argument that not enough time has been spent confronting corruption in the past, he believes it drains away so much money which could be spent on some of the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. Other leaders feel they have issues they must confront, principally possibly the one from the man that they expelled from this club, the Russian president Vladimir Putin. This group still believe that he is building military force in eastern Ukraine deliberately to keep UP eastern Ukraine deliberately to keep up pressure and further destabilise the Ukrainian government in Kiev. They want to use strong language designed to bolster those countries in the European Union who they feel may be weakening in their enthusiasm for sanctions against Russia. They want to keep that pressure up. And global health, the risk from global and MX, Chancellor Angela Merkel, in the chair, she wants to push her ideas for reforming to make things more resilient in the face of the next epidemic like Ebola. She wanted a reserve force of doctors and scientists to be deployed immediately when a pandemic hits. David Cameron says he will commit British doctors to that force and provide some money to include UK vaccines research. Thank you. The Ukip leader Nigel Farage has urged Eurosceptic MPs from all parties to put aside personal animosities, to help him build an alliance in favour of leaving the European Union. Mr Farage says they should begin campaigning now, in advance of an in-out referendum, rather than wait for David Cameron to negotiate EU reform. Four Polish lorry drivers arrested after 68 suspected illegal immigrants were found locked in their trucks have been released on bail. 15 children and two pregnant women were among the group discovered by border officials following the arrival of a ferry from the Netherlands yesterday. The Defence Secretary Michael Fallon says Europe needs to tackle the root causes of its illegal migration problem, by clamping down on trafficking and reducing the incentives for people fleeing their country. He was speaking from HMS Bulwark, a Royal Navy ship that’s been helping recover migrants making the journey from Africa, across the Mediterranean. Our Defence Correspondent jonathan Beale is on board. She’s already helped save hundreds of lives. This morning HMS Bulwark was again on patrol in the Mediterranean, poised and ready to help human wave of migrants desperate to make their way from Africa to Europe. Over the past month alone, she and her crew have already rescued almost 1800 people. Crammed on board boats that were barely seaworthy including pregnant women and children. They’ve paid hundreds of dollars to people traffickers profiting from their desire for a better life. The scale of it is tragic. Take today, more than 2000 people will have been rescued in these waters north of Libya. We don’t know whether there will be 2000 or more tomorrow. We are now sailing south towards the coast of Libya because they’ve just been told on HMS Bulwark that more than a dozen vessels carrying 3000 migrants have left the shore. The expectation here is that they will be rescuing hundreds more migrants within the next A8 hours. But that is a tiny fraction of the problem. It is estimated that there are half a million people in Libya at the moment trying to cross the Mediterranean. This afternoon, the Defence Secretary arrived on board to thank the crew for their efforts, yet he acknowledged that this alone is not a solution to the crisis. There are another 3000 people today coming across. This isjust There are another 3000 people today coming across. This is just sticking plaster, isn’t it? You’re right, we have to tackle this much further back, not simply the symptoms, rescuing them at sea, but the course of this, the trafficking routes involved, the criminal gangs making money from this trade in human misery, and in the end we must reduce the incentive for people to take these routes, in East Africa and West Africa. Tonight it is board is making another mission to save lives but while Britain is helping rescue the migrants it is not offering to resettle them yet and it is not clear how Europe can work together to tackle the human traffickers or end the chaos in the countries that they flee. People in Turkey go to the polls tomorrow, in what’s being seen as the the most significant parliamentary elections in the country for a decade. President Erdogan hopes the result will allow him to extend his powers - a move which critics say threatens the country’s democracy and stability. From Turkey, Mark Lowen reports. For a decade, Turkey’s economy has been on the move. The government build hospitals, airports, high-speed trains, bringing rapid growth. It has slowed but in places like this town, where this line heads, economic success drives support. Exports from this conservative city have risen ten times under the ruling party. Religion also defines its voters. It has encouraged headscarves for those who felt as elated by the secular constitution. Turkey has undergone a transformation in the last 12 years and now we have to complete this transformation process. We are not a mature and country in terms of democratisation all economy developed. We need a second round of transformation. At the heart of this election, Turkey’s former Prime Minister, now President Erdogan, once a reformer, critics say he has eroded free speech and democracy. Campaigning, even though the president is not allowed to do so. He is fiercely opposed in secular areas, an all-female cycling group shows of the liberal western side of Turkey, hoping to stop the President from extending his powers. We don’t need to shame ourselves when we ride bicycles by covering our legs or bodies. The turkey that I want has respect for all its citizens. And key in this election, the voice of the Kurds. Their party, the HDPE, hopes to cross the threshold for the first time and cut the government majority. Attracting left-wing voters with its focus on human rights. But their political battle is not their only fight. Turkey’s Kurds are mourning one of their soldiers killed in Syria. It is becoming a regular ritual. As Kurdish soldiers have died in Syria and Iraq it has reenergised the community in Turkey, revived the sense of a Kurdish struggle for a Kurdish identity. And that is what they are fighting for, in this election. It is a reminder of Turkey’s volatile neighbourhood and of why the West will closely watch the direction that it’s crucial ally takes. With all the sport, here’s Olly Foster at the BBC Sport Centre. Good evening, Andy Murray was knocked out of the French Open today, beaten by the World Number One Novak Djokovic in their delayed semi-final. Serena Williams is the women’s champion again, she beat Lucie Safarova to claim her 20th Grand Slam singles title. Adam Wild watched all the action. Finals weekend at Roland Garros, one of the great destinations of tennis but to reach the men’s final there remains still a great distance to travel. Storms had forced an overnight Andy Murray had catching UP overnight Andy Murray had catching up to do, Djokovic ahead, yet slightly off course, the British number one beginning where he had left off, aggressive, focus, determined. Murray had the break, forcing yet another error, she took the fourth set, as well. Level one small, but Djokovic wasn’t going to let things slip again. Andy Murray’s renewed hope fading to frustration, a final set a demonstration of renewed efficiency to which few can get close. The journey ending in brutal style. Right now I’m upset but I think my game is close to what it needs to be two winning grand slams physically. I think my game is close to what it needs to be two winning grand slams physically. I’m the final in Paris was all but expected, the first set against Lucie Safarova was swift. Despite losing the second, she couldn’t be stopped in the third. A 20th grand slam title for one of the all-time greats of the game. Barcelona are European Champions for a fifth time, they beat juventus 3-1 in the Champions League final in Berlin. Luis Suarez was one of their scorers in the Olympic Stadium and they have completed the treble, having also won the Spanish League and Cup this season. The seventh Women’s World Cup starts in the next 15 minutes with the hosts Canada playing China. England’s first match is against France next Tuesday. Katie Gornall has sent us this from Edmonton. Soon we’ll have the opening ceremony, and then Canada will kick things off against China. We are expecting 15,000 people in the Commonwealth Stadium, Edmonton. But two people will be noticeable by their absence, two people will be noticeable by theirabsence, outgoing their absence, outgoing Fifa President Sepp Blatter and general secretaryjerome Valcke have both cancelled plans to attend today. We don’t know if Mr Blatter will attend the final in Vancouver. It is because of the ongoing corruption scandal surrounding Fifa, of course. Something that David Cameron referred to when he wished England good luck in a video message before their opening game against France on the 9th ofjune. I don’t think anyone in the stadium will be thinking about those issues to much. There’s a party atmosphere as Canada gets ready to start what will be the biggest, most high-profile World Cup in women’s football history. Frankie Dettori cost the bookmakers a fortune as he won the Derby on the favourite Golden Horn. The 13-8 chance came home three and a half lengths clear. Watched by the Oueen, it was Dettori’s second victory in the Epsom classic. One bookie estimated thatit Epsom classic. One bookie estimated that it would cost their industry tens of millions of pounds. And finally, Lewis Hamilton will start on pole for tomorrow’s Canadian Grand Prix, that’s all your sport. Kensington Palace has released four photographs of Princess Charlotte with her brother Prince George. The pictures were taken at their Norfolk home when the Princess was two weeks old. Our Royal Correspondent Peter Hunt has the details. CHEERING just one month ago, just hours after being born, this was Princess Charlotte’s first public appearance with her delighted parents. There will be many more to come. Earlier that day her toddler brother Prince George visited his new sister in hospital and displayed some of the skills he will need as he grows up and comes to embrace his destiny. Now for the first time we have seen brother and sister together, the future, as things stand, of the British monarchy, George, with Charlotte in his arms, staring at the person taking the pictures, his mother. The Duchess of Cambridge is a keen amateur photographer. She took these photos when Charlotte was just two weeks old at their home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall, and at the Sandringham estate. George and Charlotte’s parents will hope they forged a bond as strong as the one between Prince William and Prince Harry. Next month the Queen will return to St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham with the Royal family gather on Christmas Day for the christening of Princess Charlotte, the fifth great grandchild. That’s all from me. Goodnight. Good evening. After an unseasonably windy day comes an unusually cold night. It will be cold if you are up early tomorrow. You should be rewarded with sunshine.

One ride at Thorpe Park and two at Chessington are closed while more safety measures are implemented. What we have put in place is a whole new level of even more stringent additional measures to just make sure that these rides are even safer. Meanwhile Alton Towers itself remains closed until further notice. Also tonight: 68 migrants, including 15 children and two pregnant women, are found hidden in lorries entering the UK at Harwich.

And dozens of colleges are banned from recruiting overseas students in a clampdown on visa cheats. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Four rollercoasters at three theme parks are now shut after the crash on a ride at Alton Towers earlier this week. 16 people were injured, four seriously. It has been closed since the accident, along with two rollercoasters at Chessington and one at Thorpe Park. Alton Towers itself remains shut until further notice, costing about £500,000 a day.

At Chessington World of Adventures, the Rattlesnake roller-coaster was grounded today, and the carriages of the Dragon’s Fury were empty, too, the ride suspended by the park operators. We have put in place a whole new level of even more stringent additional measures tojust make of even more stringent additional measures to just make sure that these rides are even safer. That is not to say they were unsafe before, but we have put another level of measures and protocols in. The Saw is the flagship ride at Surrey’s Thorpe Park, promoted for the terror it causes. Today, it was also silent, as it works like The Smiler and was made by the same company. Visitors were disappointed but understood the reasons. If they have two for safety, they do what they have to do. They have shot it for safety. It is the same mechanism. I did the Big five a few days ago, the day before the crash at Alton Towers. I am slightly worried. Other theme park companies say they have not made changes to safety protocols. You are 11+ times more at risk getting to the park than within the park. You are more likely to be struck by lightning twice than having an accident on an amusement ride. The crash happened on Tuesday afternoon as an empty carriage collided with one carrying 16 people. Those in the front row were most seriously injured. Tonight, four are still in hospital. The family of one said they expect to make a substantial claim for damages and hope criminal prosecution will be considered. Meanwhile, one eye witness who saw this view of the crash gave her perspective today on what happened after the collision. It went from worried to confusion, as, where are the staff, what is happening, where is the response, what are people doing? It was almost like there was a period of time where everyone seemed to stand still. Alton Towers has now been closed for three days. It is estimated to be costing the company half £1 million each day, but managers say those who have been hurt the first priority and they will want for nothing. Merlin Entertainments, which operates Alton Towers has said the park will be closed again tomorrow, but it is expected to reopen soon. And the company also says it is cooperating fully with the health and save the executive. But as it is the Health and Safety Executive coordinating the investigation, the timescale is in its hands. The BBC has also heard from the family of one of those critically ill in hospital, who say they are distraught that what started as a fun day out may have turned into a life changing disaster. 68 migrants, including 15 children and two pregnant women, have been found hiding in four lorries entering the UK at Harwich in Essex. Four Polish lorry drivers have been arrested on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration. The vehicles had travelled from Holland. Ben Geoghegan is in Harwich. Those 68 people are still here at the port of Harwich. They spent the day being looked after by immigration officials and volunteers from the Red Cross. They arrived here after a 5.5 hours sea crossing at 8pm last night, but we do not know the details of theirjourney up to the point at which they left Holland yesterday evening. What we have been told within the last hour is that when they were discovered, some of them were found in lorries and were hidden among stacks of Polish washing machines. These are believed to be some of the people who arrived in the lorries last night, among them 15 children and two pregnant women. Immigration officials have been at the port. It is thought several of the migrants have claimed asylum and want to remain in the UK. This is the ferry they travelled on. They were hidden in four lorries but discovered after what has been described as a proactive search by staff from Border Force. This port is used to dealing with criminals smuggling goods, but last night officials became suspicious that people were being brought into the country illegally. So they stopped the four lorries and arrested the drivers. The Home Office says Border Force officials discovered 53 adults and 15 children hidden inside the lorries. There were 35 Afghans, 22 Chinese, ten Vietnamese and one Russian. The lorry drivers were all Polish. They have been arrested by police on suspicion of people trafficking. Seven of the migrants were treated in hospital in Colchester after complaining of stomach pains and feeling faint, but they have now been released. At Tilbury docks last August, one man was found dead when 35 Afghans Sikhs were found in a container. The cause of illegal immigration is the gap between the people who want to come and the people the government is willing to admit. There is no Visa they can get an advance to come to the UK and claim asylum. As a result, many will seek alternative forms of entry. Last night is being seen as a success for the Border Force, but of the 2500 trucks coming to this port every week, only a handful are checked, so we don’t know how many people come through here undetected. The death of the former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy was caused by a major haemorrhage linked to his alcoholism, his family has said in a statement. Mr Kennedy died at his home in Fort William on Monday. Ross Hawkins is in Westminster. A desperately sad end to Charles Kennedy’s life. It was, and as his family have tried to cope with it they say they have been touched beyond measure by the warmth and affection of the tributes, some of which we saw in the House of Commons from MPs across party divides on Wednesday. They said how grateful they were that his son, Donald, was able to witness that. But they confirmed what many of his friends would have expected and feared, that his death was a direct consequence of his alcoholism. They said he had struggled to overcome that but had not been able to do so, despite the help of friends and his own efforts. They have been incredibly frank, hoping, I think, for a greater understanding of alcoholism, but also determined that he should be remembered for much more than the illness with which he struggled. The Lloyds Banking Group has been fined a record £117 million by the City watchdog, for unfairly treating customers’ complaints about Payment Protection Insurance. Over a 15-month period, Lloyds rejected nearly 40% of complaints relating to PPI policies. The bank has now apologised and says it’s holding back £30 million in bonuses from staff. Simon Gompertz reports. Also to mind, the banks facing huge compensation pay-outs top macro The British Bankers Association has lost a High Court challenge... PPI. Mopping up the scandal has taken a decade so far, and now there is more. Lloyds, penalised for large-scale mishandling of complaints. Complaints from people like Graham, who was sold payment protection insurance to help if he could not pay back alone. Like so many, quite wrongly, because the policy did not cover him. He was then fobbed off I Lloyds complaints department. They ripped people off twice. We did not need the PPI in the first place, and when they realised people had been mis-sold PPI, they should havejust realised people had been mis-sold PPI, they should have just refund PPI, they should havejust refund of the money. Complaint handlers were told to act as if Lloyds sales staff had followed correct procedures. Customers’ versions of what happened were ignored. Some were told their cases have been fully investigated when they had not. If the dice are loaded against customers complaining, that inflicts further damage on trust in the banks, which is why the fine on Lloyds is so large, because they have undermined the system which is in place for people who think they have been treated unfairly to get justice. Lloyds Chief Executive is to be stripped of £350,000 of his bonus. He said, we made mistakes in our handling of some PPI complaints. I am very sorry for this. It will make many customers think, was I fobbed off wrongly? Should I resubmit my claim? Anyone in doubt should go back to their bank, whoever it is. So expect even more of this. You could be entitled to thousands in compensation... Cold calling claims companies try to cash in, as PPI pay-outs top £29 billion. An army medic on duty when three reservists collapsed and died on a training exercise two years ago has told an inquest he had not read military guidance on how to avoid heat injuries, and that he wasn’t expected to. The men died on one of the hottest days of the year during an SAS selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons. The inquest is taking place in Solihull. A woman has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering her terminally-ill friend at a care home in North Yorkshire. 5lI-year-old Heather Davidson smothered David Paterson, who was 82, with a pillow, despite his opposition to euthanasia. She argued in court that it was a mercy killing. She was told she would spend at least nine years injail. Danny Savage reports. They were friends who shared a mutual love of gardening but when David Paterson became terminally ill, Heather Davidson decided to murder him in what she described as a mercy killing. David Paterson had been moved into this care home to die with dignity, but during a visit from Heather Davidson, she made this emotional phone call from his bedside to MacMillan Cancer Support. Shortly afterwards, Heather Davidson made up her mind. She was going to kill her friend. Her victim’s family say he would never have wanted his life to be ended prematurely. Their thoughts today were spoken by their family liaison officer. We all want to know why this has happened. It makes no sense at all. Heather Davidson was a churchgoer, a person uncle David had helped, but he trusted and considered a friend. She has taken away our opportunity and rights to grieve for him. The pair met through this church in Thirsk. It is said David Paterson would not have believed a friend would act in this way. Heather Davidson, a troubled alcoholic, was once arrested for trying to suffocate the dog. As for her claim of carrying out a mercy killing, the judge told her, murder is murder.

A BBC investigation has found new evidence that vulnerable patients are at risk of suicide because of a lack of care at a mental-health trust. Norfolk and Suffolk is the only trust of its kind to have been put into special measures after being declared unsafe by inspectors in February. But a whistleblower has told the BBC that staff are now so overstretched, they are fire-fighting to keep patients alive. The trust insists it is putting things right. This mental-health trust is failing patients. Norfolk and Suffolk, previously deemed unsafe by inspectors and put into special measures. Tonight, we can reveal new evidence about how patients are still at risk. Families desperate for help, and worries from a whistle-blower who says some of the most vulnerable patients cannot get the right help. For the relatives of patients like 25-year-old Matthew Duggan, the past few years have been unimaginably painful. Two years ago, the graphic designer became depressed. He told a therapist he could not keep safe. Faced with a month-long delay for treatment, he ended his life. His mother is still haunted by what happened to her son. The hardest thing for me is the last picture you have when we identified his body. When I sleep, that is the picture I see. It is really hard to remember his life. His death was just so awful. These are the faces of other patients who have died while in the trust’s care over the last four years. Stephen Foster, failed by the NHS. Donna Carrigan, allowed to leave hospital despite being a suicide risk. And Luther Benjamin Hughes, let down by the system. There are other mental-health trusts in England with greater numbers of deaths reported, but in Norfolk and Suffolk, there has been concern about a spike in the number of deaths following cuts to services. A senior clinician working in the community spoke to us on condition of anonymity. She described staff as firefighting to keep patients alive, and said the trust’s bosses still were not listening. None of us are getting any hint that people are listening to us, that something is going to change, and we used to say, what has to happen, do people have to start dying? People started dying, and we are still on the same track. In a statement, the trust said, the board know what is important, understand where they got it wrong and are putting it right. They will continue to listen and learn and improve and ensure the trust offers high-quality and safe services. But Ann Humphries says the services are still not safe. Her teenage daughter Bethan has been taken to hospital ten times following attempted suicides. She is desperate for her to get more help, but says despite the trust promising improvements, nothing has changed. For now, she takes turns with her partner to check on Bethan every 30 minutes through the night, when she is most vulnerable. Every time I go to her bedroom to check on her, every time I go to bed, wake up in the morning, my first thought is, is my child still alive? Norfolk and Suffolk will go down in NHS history as being the first mental-health trust to be put into special measures for its unprecedented failings. Some of the most vulnerable patients have been put at risk. The trust says it is investing in more front-line staff, but stressed things will not change overnight. It is now receiving support from a director of improvement, previously employed to help turn around Mid-Staffs, the trust at the centre of one of the worst hospital scandals ever to hit the NHS. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has told his parliament that the latest proposals from the IMF and the EU are not realistic. He was speaking on the day that Greece missed a key international debt deadline. to accept alternative repose or is being drawn up in Athens. The High Court has ruled that the Government took an unlawful and unacceptably long time to pay new welfare benefits to two disabled people. The two, who have not been named, said their nine-month wait for the money had left them dependent on loan sharks and food banks. Richard wants to work, but he cannot. After being injured in a car crash in 2012, he applied for a personal independence payment. The payments are supposed to help cover the hidden costs of having a disability. But for Richard, it was ten months before he started receiving any money. I got myself into so much debt, I have been trying to play catch up. I thought the only way out was to be not around any more. The waiting times are demoralising, something needs to be done. Today, something was done. Two unnamed claimants who were forced to turn to loan sharks and food bags to get by have successfully argued that their waiting times were not only unacceptable, they were unlawful. We were never calling for PIP to be scrapped, Parliament decided it had to be introduced, but it has to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, so until the system is that for purpose, it should not be rolled out any further. The government has acknowledged there were problems in the original roll-out. They say they have taken decisive action to speed UP have taken decisive action to speed up waiting times, and the average claimant now only wait seven weeks, but figures show over 3000 people have waited for more than a year for an outcome from their initial application. Even though the court has found in favour of these claimants, this is not a test case, so this ruling will not set a precedent for the tens of thousands of people still waiting for a decision. Richard has now got some of the help he needs from his parents, who saved up to surprise him with this mobility scooter. Did you feel let down? Very much so. We have always worked, page tax, insurance, nevertaken have always worked, page tax, insurance, never taken anything out of the system. When our son needs it, it is not there. Andy Murray is trying to reach uncharted territory. He’s attempting to make the final of the French Open tennis tournament for the first time, a feat that has eluded any British man since the 1930s. Mind you, he’s taking on a man who is aiming to emulate the sport’s all-time greats, Novak Djokovic. There are lots of ways of waiting in Paris, passive, and more active. Two men’s semifinals on Friday, Andy Murray had to wait, but this was just the occasion you practice for. He walks onto court at lI:15pm UK time in the form of his life, but so did his opponent. Novak Djokovic carried an invincible air. With the temperature nudging 35 Celsius, this was going to be a test of everything Marie had. There was a strong possibility that Novak Djokovic would be better. That is ridiculous. But were there signs of wilting from Novak Djokovic? The trainer was summoned and sent back, he just needed the iced towels. In the grandstand, they did their best with what they had. Maybe Novak Djokovic was just what they had. Maybe Novak Djokovic wasjust kidding, the serve broken in the eighth game, and the set followed to Novak Djokovic, 6-3. Under their feet, followed to Novak Djokovic, 6-3. Undertheirfeet, clay, in Andy Murray’s head, familiar frustrations against the world number one. The second set went to Novak Djokovic, 6-3. The only grand Slam the Serbian has not won. Full Andy Murray, prepare for no’s more waiting. Thousands of musicians and singers have been performing across the UK today as part of the BBC’s first Music Day. Here’sjust a flavour of Susan Lambert on the harp at Hadrian’s Wall in Cumbria. Or perhaps james Bay and his band performing in Glasgow today may have been more to your taste. Yes, on the stage behind me, one band hasjust finished, another is due on, it is one of a huge number of events across the country. Musicians of all kinds have been taking part in the first BBC Music Day, every performance broadcast somewhere on the BBC. A soul. For a special celebration. -- a soulful start. A musical message that has travelled the length of Hadrian ‘s Wall. From the remains of a Roman fort... To this 12th century priory. This part of the day has been dubbed Hadrian ‘s Wall of Sound. It is an event that is taking in the whole of the UK. In Glasgow, james Blake’s earthy sound overcame the elements. Today was notjust sound overcame the elements. Today was not just about fans and music, for the BBC a chance to emphasise its long-standing support of the music of all kinds. It is really important the BBC gets behind this, the BBC is what we all listen to as kids, it is what taught us, it was our education, apprenticeship, listening to what was played on the radio. Foryounger listening to what was played on the radio. For younger people, radio. Foryounger people, not necessarily pop or rock, crucial elements in the intimate atmosphere of the day’s act of worship on BBC Radio li. And equally powerful atmosphere in County Armagh for radio Ulster. In Cardiff, they opted to bond with listeners through film school classics. Time for a look at the weather.

That’s all from the BBC News At Six, so it’s goodbye from me, Tonight on BBC London: A former teacher escapes jail after he admitted possessing thousands of indecent pictures of children. These are not victimless crimes. These are children who have been photographed, and whose images have been shown around the world. The judge said Anthony Fuggle’s career had ended in disgrace. Also tonight: More than 50 private colleges are barred from recruiting overseas students in a clampdown on visa cheats. Detecting the body heat of a cyclist - the new technology which could change how traffic lights operate. And: Elementary, my dearWatson. We hear from Sir Ian McKellen on his new movie role as Sherlock Holmes. Seeing a man of such brilliance getting frail, his mind not working as it used to do, it is a painful situation. Good evening. I’m Asad Ahmad. A former teacher at one of the country’s top private schools in Barnes who admitted storing thousands of indecent images of children has escaped jail. Anthony Fuggle, a former classics master, was given a suspended sentence. He taught at Colet Court, a feeder school for St Paul’s where Chancellor George Osbourne was taught. Well, Fuggle had thousands of images of children, some as young as 12. Tonight, a charity has criticised the decision not to jail him, as Alice Bhandhukravi reports. Anthony Fuggle, a 58-year-old classics teacher who was held in high regard by pupils, parents and teachers alike at Colet Court in Barnes. But by his own admission, he is also an internet abuser. Suspicions were raised after a routine inspection of the school computer system. Images were found on Mr Fuggle’s computer, images of boys. In total, nearly 3,000 internet images considered to be indecent. His defence lawyer in court read out character references from a colleague at the school, and even a parent, describing him as dedicated, modest, kind and supportive. But between 2007 and 2013, Mr Fuggle’s demons got the better of him. The court heard that when he was questioned by police, Mr Fuggle told them that he got sexual gratification from looking at pictures of boys of a certain age. That age was the age of boys that he taught, though none of the indecent images found on his computer were of pupils at his school. In passing his sentence, the judge told him... Mr Fuggle was given a four-month sentence, suspended for two years, but anti-child abuse campaigners say it sends out the wrong message. We are hugely, hugely disappointed. The message that that sentence sends out is really disappointing for survivors, particularly of abuse. Look at the numbers. Over2,000 images, indecent, and some at the most serious end of the scale. So this is notjust some hobbyist or anything. And the other point to make of it too is that these are not victimless crimes. These are children who have been photographed and whose images have been shared around the web and around the world. Anthony Fuggle is on the Sex Offenders’ Register, now forced to walk away from a life dedicated to teaching. You’re watching BBC London News.

More than 50 private colleges are barred from recruiting overseas students in a clampdown on visa cheats. And a former teacher escapes jail after he admitted possessing thousands of indecent pictures of children. Good evening. 68 migrants, including 15 children and two pregnant women, have been found hiding in four lorries entering the UK at Harwich in Essex. Four Polish lorry drivers have been arrested on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration. The vehicles had travelled from Holland. Our Special Correspondent Lucy Manning is in Harwich tonight. So, Lucy, how were the migrants discovered? Well this time last night the ferry behind me was being searched. The migrants were found in lorries. They were hiding behind Polish dishwashers on board. So determined to get here for whatever their reasons, that pregnant women and children took the risk of travelling. They made it here alive but they are now being held by border officials but it is expected that many if not all of them will try to claim asylum. It is thought to be the biggest discovery of people trying to make it into the UK illegally. Far from home. Some illegally. Farfrom home. Some of Far from home. Some of the 68 stow aways led away, breathing the free air after 68 hours crammed inside a lorry. Discovered at this port. 35 from Aving, 22 Chinese, 10 vet 234578ees and a Russian. Many nationalalities but one aim, to get to Britain. The ferry docking tonight, the same one they came in on last night, travelling from Holland, hiding in the back of four lorries. Discovered locked in them after a search, the four Polish drivers have been aarrested. Bernard jenkin the local MP, visited the border officials who found them. We don’t know, because the answer is we don’t check every lorry. 91+% of the trucks go through unchecked so it’s perfectly possible that more migrants got through in this way than we know about. They might be illegally in the United Kingdom. This appears a more organised attempt to enter the country illegally, than those who try to iump illegally, than those who try to jump on the back of lorries in Calais. Drivers say this is a hazard of the job. They get in anywhere where they can. If it is under a spare wheel, if they can cut the top of the roof, they will get in the back that way. I have seen them in trucks like rats. Trying to get in car transporters, truck transporters, fridges. You can understand the desperation. Seven of the suspected Geneva Conventional immigrants were taken to hospital, including the two pregnant women. The Red Cross helping those detained. The number of people caught attempting to enter the UK has risen over years, from over 11,000 three years ago to almost 20,000 and now to 40,000 up until this year. Like any form of illegal activity with once you close down an area, the area moves on. As Calais becomes high-profile, the resources are diverted, then the trafficking moves along the coast or in this case up to another country. The sea, a barrier but it did not stop them as countries across Europe struggle to protect their shores, those who come for safety or for a better life will not be deterred. Four rollercoasters at three theme parks - owned by the same company - are now shut after the crash on a ride at Alton Towers earlier this week. Sixteen people were injured, four seriously. It has been closed since the accident along with two rollercoasters at Chessington and one at Thorpe Park. Alton Towers remains shut until further notice - costing about half a million pounds a day in lost revenue. judith Moritz reports. Already out of action, the Smiler has now been banned as well. The Health and Safety Executive working to remove its carriages which will be taken away for detailed analysis as work continues to find the cause of the crash. Alton Towers remains closed but now it is not the only theme park to feel the consequences of the accident. At Chessington World of Adventures, the Rattlesnake roller coaster was grounded and the carriages of the Dragon’s Fury were emptied, the ride suspended by operators. What we have put in place is a whole new level of even more stringent additional measures to make sure that these rides are even safer. Not to say they were unsafe before, it is another level of measures and protocols that we have put in. The Saw is the flagship ride at Surrey’s Thorpe Park, promoted for the terror it causes but it was also silent today as it was made by the same company that built the Smiler. Visitors were disappointed but understood the reasons. I think they have to for safety, they do what they have to do. It is for safety reasons, same mechanism as the Smiler. I came and did all of the big five here. That was the day before the crash at Alton Towers. Yeah, I am slightly worried. Other theme park companies say they have not made any changes to their safety protocols this week. You are 14 times more at risk getting to the park than you are within the park. You are more likely to be struck by lightning twice than have an accident on an amusement ride. The Smiler crash happened on Tuesday afternoon as an empty carriage collided with one carrying 16 people. Those in the front row were most seriously injured. Four are still in hospital. Vicky Bouch, Daniel Thorpe, joe Pugh and Leah Washington. Vicky is critically ill. Tonight her family revealed that they expect to make a substantial claim for damages. They hope that criminal prosecution will be considered. Distraught that the teenager’s fun day out turned into a potentially life-changing disaster. An eyewitness who saw this view of the crash gave her perspective today on what happened. It went from almost worry to confusion. Where are the staff, what is happening? Where is the response? What are people doing? It was almost like there was a period where everybody stood still. Alton Towers has now been closed for three days and it is estimated to cost the company half a million pounds a day but managers say those hurt are the first priority and they will want for nothing. The park’s owner says that it will make sure that those hurt will want for nothing. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has rejected the latest proposals from the country’s international creditors - which include tax rises and further privatisation. Mr Tsipras told the Greek Parliament he would not allow the country to be ""subjugated or humiliated"" and insisted any deal would need to include debt relief. From Athens, james Reynolds reports. This country counts every euro that it can find. It needs every cent for the battles its choosing to fight. Tonight the Prime Minister has called Europe’s latest proposals unrealistic. Greece still wants a rescue with no major cuts. TRANSLATION: It is time for everyone to prove that they are working towards a viable solution and not to subjugate and humiliate an entire nation. Because if that is what they are doing, they should know it will have the exact opposite effect. Athens University Law School has seen better days. No-one picks up the rubbish anymore. If Greece is to reach a deal with Europe, this university may have to make more cuts. But its workers already say no. I guess we could go on a strike again. I mean there is no other way to deal with it. I don’t think that we have the possibility anymore to stand this situation. We have already lost too much. Shouting from the stands doesn’t always make a difference. Business owner Pedro has saved up to take his seven-year-old son to watch their team, Panathaikos. We have to change our mentality as people as well in Greece. In what way? We must stop thinking about now and we must plan ahead 10, 15 years ahead for our son, for our children’s future. Tonight Greece approaches its deadlines with a sense of defiance. It is a risk. No deal, means no money. And the Greek Prime Minister has essentially spent most of the evening here in Parliament, laying sandbags around his major demand, no more austerity. European capitals will no have enjoyed listening to what he had to say. They will have noticed that there is no appetite whatsoever for the major concessions that they need to see from Greece. But Europe will remember this: Europe institutions and the IMF control the money that Greece needs in order to stay afloat and there are several weeks left until the end ofjune to get the Greek government to back down before they cancel the next set of bail-out funds. The death of the former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy was caused by a major haemorrhage linked to his alcoholism, his family has said in a statement: Mr Kennedy died at his home in Fort William on Monday. Our Political Correspondent Ross Hawkins is in Westminster. A desperately sad end to Charles Kennedy’s life. It is. His family coping with that sadness and that grief. They say that this have been touched beyond measure by the warmth and the affection shown to him. They say how grateful they were that his 10-year-old son Donald was there to witness the train use. . But they feared that his death was a direct consequence of that alcoholism. He could not conner that illness. But they are determined that he should be remembered for much more than the illness with which he suffered. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories.

The White House says Americans are facing an ever evolving threat to the nation’s cyber security, after a widespread breach of the records of all the federal government’s employees. A White House spokesman said it was too early to say with certainty who was behind the attack, but at the same briefing raised concerns about China’s hacking activity. China denies any involvement. jon Sopel has more. For Federal government employees arriving for work this morning, much more to think about than just what they will do this weekend. They have worries about what of their personal information has been stolen in the cyber attack on all 4 million government staff. The finger has been pointed at the Chinese. At his daily briefing, the president’s spokesman said it was too soon to say. No conclusions about the attribution of this particular attack have been Then without actually apportioning blame, there came a big... But, when it comes to China, you all know that the President has frequently, including in every single meeting he has conducted with the current Chinese president, raised China’s activities in cyberspace as a significant source of concern. In Beijing, the Chinese government hit back angrily. TRANSLATION: Hacking attacks are conducted anonymously across nations and it’s hard to track the source. It’s irresponsible and unscientific to make conjecture and groundless allegations before making in-depth investigations. There’s now a full FBI investigation into what has been hacked and the extent to which sensitive personal information like security clearances and background checks has been compromised. And as this cyber security expert told us, what the FBI will be keen to establish his motive. The reason people do this is because there is value associated with that data. Either there is value on the black market for selling personal data for identity, or there is value potentially to state-sponsored activities, to know, for example, who all the Federal employees are. The US government and American companies are spending billions of dollars each to protect vital data. On the basis of what’s emerged in the last 24 hours, it looks as though they might need to spend a whole lot more. jon Sopel is at the White House now. Where does this leave US-China relations tonight? Well, Fiona, the whole issue of cyber espionage has been a running sore in relations between China and the United States. This is not the first hack of government information and the investigators believe the Trail invariably leads back to China. It was interesting at the briefing today that while he did not completely blame the Chinese, he did not exonerate them either. This comes at a time when the US Defence Secretary has been in the region this week, amid rising tension in the South China Sea over disputed islands. He has told the BBC that the United States will continue to be the pre-eminent military force in the region, at a time when China is increasing militarisation. What you have with China and the United States is a key and crucial relationship, but as we have seen in the past few days, it can also be rather fraught. A BBC investigation has found new concerns that vulnerable patients are at risk of suicide because of a lack of care at a mental health trust. Norfolk and Suffolk is the only trust of its kind to have been put into special measures after being declared ""unsafe"" by inspectors in February. But a whistle-blower has told the BBC that staff are now so overstretched they are firefighting to keep patients alive. The trust insists it is putting things right. Sophie Hutchinson has this exclusive report. This mental health trust is failing patients. Norfolk and Suffolk, previously deemed unsafe by inspectors and put into special measures. Tonight we can reveal new evidence about how patients are still at risk. Families desperate for help and worries from a whistle-blower who says some of the most vulnerable patients can’t get the right help. For the relatives of patients like 25-year-old Matthew Dunham, the past few years have been unimaginably painful. Two years ago, the graphic designer became depressed. He told a therapist he couldn’t keep safe. Faced with a month-long delay for treatment, he ended his life. His mother is still haunted by what happened to her son. The hardest thing for me is the last picture you have. We had to identify his body. When I sleep, that is the picture I see. It’s really hard to remember his life because his death was just so awful. These are the faces of other patients who’ve died while in the trust’s care over the last four years. Stephen Foster, failed by the NHS. Donna Carrigan, allowed to leave hospital despite being a suicide risk. And Luther Benjamin Hughes, let down by the system. There are other mental health trusts in England with greater numbers of deaths reported, but in Norfolk and Suffolk there has been concern about a spike in the number of deaths following cuts to services. A senior clinician working in the community spoke to us on condition of anonymity. She described staff as fire fighting to keep patients alive and said the trust’s bosses still weren’t listening. None of us are getting any kind of hint that people are listening to us, that something is going to change. We used to say, ""Well, what has to happen? ""Do people have to start dying""? But people started dying and we are still on the same track. In a statement, the trust said, the board know what is important, understand where they got it wrong and are putting it right. They will continue to listen, learn and improve and will ensure the trust offers high quality and safe services. But Anne Humphreys says the services are still not safe. Herteenage daughter, Bethan, has been taken to hospital ten times following attempted suicides. Anne is desperate for her to get more help but says, despite the trust promising improvements, nothing has changed. For now, Anne takes turns with her partner to check on Bethan every 30 minutes through the night, when she is most vulnerable. Every time I go to her bedroom to check on her, every time I go to bed, every time I wake up in the morning, my first thought is, ""Is my child still alive""? Norfolk and Suffolk will go down in NHS history as being the first mental health trust to be put into special measures for its unprecedented failings. Some of the most vulnerable patients have been put at risk here. The trust says it’s investing in more front-line staff but stressed things will not change overnight. It’s now receiving support from a director of improvement previously employed to help turn around Mid Staffs, the trust at the centre of the one of the worst hospital scandals ever to hit the NHS. Sophie Hutchinson, BBC News. Saddam Hussein’s close adviser Tariq Aziz has died in an Iraqi prison at the age of 79. Aziz, who was Saddam’s deputy prime minster, surrendered to US troops in 2003 and was awaiting execution when he fell ill. A fluent English speaker, he made his name by staunchly defending Saddam Hussein to the world during the two Gulf Wars and was loyal to his leader to the end. Russia’s campaign to host the World Cup was clean and the country is on track, according to the man who ran the bed. He also told the BBC he was disappointed with England and other countries for saying they could host the World Cup if Fifa decides to rerun the bidding process. We are disappointed because first of all it is true that England were our rivals, but we won. So I think some people should learn how to lose with dignity. A tricky GCSE maths question this week stumped thousands of students and has been causing a storm on social media. The question said that a girl called Hannah had a bag of sweets of which six were orange. It said the chances of Hannah picking two orange sweets in a row was one in three and asked pupils to use that to prove that n squared minus n minus 90 equals 0. The topic was trending on Twitter and online petitions were set up calling on the board to lower the grade boundaries when marking. But others thought the question wasn’t too hard and took to the internet to give their solution. Edexcel’s owner Pearson said it aimed to ""test the full range"" of abilities. Tennis, and Andy Murray’s semi-final at the French Open was suspended this evening due to a thunder storm. Murray was fighting back after losing the first two sets. He and Novak Djokovic will resume play tomorrow. joe Wilson reports. In Paris, there are waiters, especially when it comes to British tennis. No British man in the final here since 1937. But since childhood it is exactly what you have practised for, if you are Andy Murray. With the temperature nudging 35 Celsius, this was going to be a test of everything Murray had. Djokovic’s motivation? This is the only grand slam title he has not won. That’s ridiculous. Spectators improvised against the heat on court. Murray mustered what he could. Serve broken in the eighth game, the set followed to Djokovic, 6-3. Undertheirfeet, clay, in Murray’s head, a brick wall. He lost the second set 6-3, seemed to be gone. Instead, magically Murray raised himself to another level. The crowd knew it, he knew it, the scoreboard knew it. Murray won the set 7-5. What a lift! Now it was excellence and sheer endurance. Three hours in, who could take it further? Infact, nobody. The players were hurried off court minutes before a storm arrived, play suspended, 3-3 in the fourth set. Nothing else to do but wait. joe Wilson, BBC News. A 73-mile long musical relay along Hadrian’s Wall, a world-record breaking duet, and hundreds of performances across the country.

13,BBC1 London,2-jun-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,40 mins,True,"The former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has died suddenly at the age of 55. Charles Kennedy is going to fight for that, Charles Kennedy is going to fight forthat, new Charles Kennedy - an MP for 32 years - was seen as one of the most engaging and down-to-earth politicians of his age. He was found at his home in Fort William - police said there were no suspicious circumstances - friends and colleagues today paid tribute to the politician and the man. Above all, his bent over 30 years at the House of Commons, yet throughout that time he remained a curtly decent human being. We’ll be looking back at Charles Kennedy’s life and career. Also this lunchtime, how to fight Islamic State - foreign ministers from the US-led coalition meet in Paris to review their strategy.

On BBC London, an official look at the Metropolitan Police finds improvements must be made to the way rape cases are handled. And trying to find this newly wedded couple pictured near Tower Bridge. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News at one. ""one of the most talented politicians"" with ""immense ability"" and an unusual gift for ""humour and humility"". just some of the tributes which have been pouring in this morning to Charles Kennedy, the former Liberal Democrat leader, who has died suddenly at the age of 55. He was found at his home in Fort William, no cause of death has been given, but police have said it was not suspicious. Charles Kennedy was one of Britain’s most charismatic and witty politicians, who led his party from 1999 to 2006. His family said they were devastated to lose a ""fine man and a loving father."" Here’s our Scotland Political Editor Brian Taylor, his report contains some flash photography. The scene outside Charles Kennedy’s house in Fort William this morning after his body was found. Police issued a statement describing a sudden death, but with no suspicious circumstances. His family said they were devastated at the loss, and described him as a fine man, a talented politician and a loving father to his young son. Charles Kennedy was a leading figure on the UK political stage, but he was firstly a Scottish Highlander. Here campaigning before the last election. He canvassed, he cajoled, but to no avail. After 32 years, his hold on his own seat was swept aside in the Scottish National Party title advance. Still, he was hugely admired by our adversaries. This is a tragic loss for Charles’s family and my heart goes out to them, and it is also a tragic loss for politics and public life. He was someone of immense ability, and it’s not that often in politics someone comes along with brains, talent, wit and bags of humanity, and Charles had all of those things. He achieved so much, so young and he has been taken from us far too soon. The news about Charles Kennedy is stunning, and absolutely tragic. Charles was one of these rare people in politics. He was a brilliant and effective politician, perhaps one of the most talented politicians of his generation, and yet somehow he managed to be universally liked. Today, people in his former constituency praised Charles Kennedy. Everyone will remember him because he was such a gentleman and he was quite a character. He will be well remembered for all the good things he did. He was brilliant, absolutely brilliant local MP. Very sad. First elected in 1983, it was the youngest MP at the time, not long out of university, an orator, a debater, a campaigner for reform and justice. He sometimes seemed uncomfortable with the playacting which partisan politics occasionally requires. He isjulia elected the leader of the lead -- requires. He isjulia elected the leader of the lead -- Liberal Democrats. He led his party from 1999, taking a firm stand against the war in Iraq, when others in his party counselled caution. After prolonged speculation, you finally confirmed injanuary 2006 prolonged speculation, you finally confirmed in january 2006 that he had been receiving treatment for an alcohol problem. He stood down as leader, neverto alcohol problem. He stood down as leader, never to return to the front bench. On May eight occasions, whether it was in the house, in front of the media, orjust when he turns -- front of the media, orjust when he turns -- on many occasions, the old Charles, the sparkle, the wit, humour and charm was there, and it made you realise what a shame it was that he had those problems and was not able to entirely resolve them. Charles Kennedy, proud Scot, talented politician but also a warm human being, whose apparent flaws only endeared him more to the people he met. Charles Kennedy’s political career began in what was then the SDP. He became the youngest MP of the time at the age of 23, when he won the seat of Ross, Cromarty and Skye in 1983. Our correspondent Carole Walker looks back now on Charles Kennedy’s political life. He was the youngest MP in the house when he was elected in 1983. Charles Kennedy swiftly made his mark. He was an early member of the new social Democratic party and led the drive for a driver with the Liberal party, which created the Liberal Democrats. He quickly became popular in his party and with the wider public. When Paddy Ashdown stood down, Charles Kennedy won the battle to succeed him. Charles Kennedy is duly elected the leader of the Liberal Democrats. He was determined to bring a different approach to politics. The Liberal Democrats are nobody’s poodles, but we are not rot while as either. He connected with an audience outside Westminster. Chat show Charlie as he was called, outgoing, informaland show Charlie as he was called, outgoing, informal and witty. At Westminster, he carved out a distinctive position for his party, taking on the then Labour leader, Tony Blair. In the run-up to the Iraq walk as a million people marched in protest to Hyde Park, Charles Kennedy took on the Westminster establishment, with powerful arguments against the deployment of British troops. This is the riskiest moment for Britain since Suez. Our country has a principled and responsible role to play on the world stage. But to do so we have to pursue international justice through the United Nations. At the election two years later, he led the Liberal Democrats to their best ever result, winning more than 60 seats. But throughout it all, he had faced questions over his drinking. At times appearing gaunt and below par. In 2006, he admitted to his problems. Over the past 18 months, I’ve been coming to terms with, and seeking to cope with, a during the problem, and I’ve come to learn through that process that any drink problem is a serious problem indeed. It was the beginning of the end of his leadership. Today, other Lib Dem leaders have led the tributes. Charles took an independent position and spoke in a language that reached way beyond the narrow political circle of Westminster, which is why he was so loved. It wasjust Westminster, which is why he was so loved. It was just so tragic to see someone with such huge gifts also struggle, as many people do, with the demons that clearly beset him, and the problem is that he acknowledged that he had with our coal. On question Time earlier this year, he was not at his best, appearing distracted and uncharacteristically sorry. I am in favour of 2%, yes. He remained an effective campaigner and in the Commons the Speaker said he had been a principled and passionate politician. In an age of pervasive cynicism about politics, and politicians, Charles have that rare and uncanny capacity to cut through to large numbers of voters of all political persuasions and/or the none. At the election, he knew he faced a tough battle to hold onto the seat he had held the 32 years. He was swept away in the SNP surge. We can all consider and reflect in years to come, perhaps our grandchildren, we were there the night of the long sgian-dhus. He said he would return to the fray to campaign for Britain to stay in Europe. Politics has been deprived of a rare talent. That IS go back to Brian in Glasgow. There has been a real outpouring of genuine sadness over Charles Kennedy this morning full stop there really has. Sometimes these things are formulaic, but today there is genuine admiration for a fine man and genuine sympathy for a quite remarkable tragedy. In successive months, Charles Kennedy lost his father, who died in April, he lost its Parliamentary seat, he has now lost a zone life. Looking back his career, how you assessed -- lost a zone life. Looking back his career, how you assessed -- his own life. He will be recalled for his ability, his intellect, his humour, and his humanity but also perhaps for that stand on the war in Iraq. He was twice rector of Glasgow University, Benjamin Disraeli was a predecessor in that post, he was said to have said Daniel principles, stick to your party. Charles Kennedy stuck to his principles. Norman Smith is in Westminster for us. It is very striking this lunchtime, there have been tributes across the political divide to Charles Kennedy, and he has been genuinely mourned by people who he had big political differences with. Striking, but not in the least bit surprising, because Charles Kennedy was a politician who was open, engaging, generous to both his political opponents, and to his friends, but there is a more fundamental reason, I think, why there has been so much affection towards Charles Kennedy from across the political divide, and that is because at corps he was a conviction politician. He had profound beliefs, which he stuck to, most notably of course over the Iraq walk away he was prepared to put his beliefs down on the line and fight for them. You have to remember the climate at that time, there was a gale of political opinion, of establishment desire to go to war. The Americans pressing the British government to take a decision, Tony Blair trying to cajole the Commons to go to war, the Conservative Party fully supported, the media in full cry, and Charles Kennedy stood up and made a stand, against some in his own party, and I think that tells a truth about Charles Kennedy. Do not be deceived by the chat show Charlie image, this idea that he was merely someone who engaged with the public. He was that, but it was much, much more. He was at heart a conviction politician, and that is why people here at my attempt. Yes, he was able to -- here at my attempt. Yes, he was able to -- people here are admired him. He had profound respect from politicians across the political divide. Norman, thank you very much. We will have more on the life and career of Charles Kennedy later in the programme. Foreign Ministers from 20 countries from the coalition fighting Islamic State are meeting in Paris to re-examine their strategy against the militants. They include the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. The fall of Ramadi in Iraq last month raised questions about the current strategy of air raids against IS - and support for Iraqi forces - but no troops on the ground. Our Security Correspondent Frank Gardner reports now from Paris. From around 20 countries they’ve come here to Paris, trying to find the formula to feet Islamic State, also known as Isil. Because the coalition’s efforts to date have not been enough. We have to make it enough, we have to work with the Iraqis to train new forces, to organise the militias, to continue the process of getting the militias under the effective control of the government, so that we can, over time, consolidate, push Isil back, and then sustainably hold the ground thatis and then sustainably hold the ground that is recovered from Isil, preferably with forces that come from the areas in question. The origins of Islamic State go back to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. A fanaticaljordanian jihadist A fanatical jordanian jihadist founded Al A fanaticaljordanian jihadist founded Al Prader in Iraq. He was killed in an air strike in 2006. Then followed the Anbar awakening, a They fled to Syria, and became the strongest rebel group, read landing themselves as -- strongest rebel group, read landing themselves as -- rebranding themselves as Islamic State. Last summer they swept back into Iraq. They are still seizing ground. This summer, Islamic State have advanced into PAL mirror in central Syria, and taken remedy, just a short drive from Baghdad. -- and taken remedy, just a short drive from Baghdad. -- taken Ramadi. This is not a war that can be fought from the air alone. Almost the only sizeable forces capable of confronting IS on the ground are the Iranian backed Shia militias. And they are deeply distrusted by Iraq Sunnis. It is a profound problem for the coalition. Meanwhile, jihadi is from Britain, Europe and the Middle East continued to fill the ranks of IS. They are thought to number over 20,000. Many return home, presenting Western government with a security problem that could last for a generation. Our COI’I’âSpoI’IdâI’ICâ Our correspondence Hugh Schofield is also following that summit in Paris. What can this meeting realistically achieve? If you are looking for radical changes of policy, I don’t think there will be one. The big radical departures would be putting boots on the ground, may be supporting Bashar al-Assad in Syria but there is no prospect of that. On the other hand, no one can pretend things are going according to plan the stop the should have been a moment when they could report progress but they can’t, quite the opposite. So what is going to change I think is the fine print. They will say the existing policy is the right one, they’rejust say the existing policy is the right one, they’re just needs to be say the existing policy is the right one, they’rejust needs to be more of it. On the one hand, we have the Prime Minister of Iraq calling for more arms, more air strikes, more training of his men by the Allies. They will say fair enough, but in return you have to do more of your side of the bargain, doing more to recognise -- side of the bargain, doing more to recognise -- reconcile these cities with the government, and becoming less dependent on Shi’ite militias. I think that will be the outcome. A promise to identify existing policy. The Government says it wants to clamp down on what it calls ""rip-off"" staffing agencies that the NHS in England uses to fill gaps in nursing and doctor rotas. A maximum hourly rate will be introduced after more than £3 billion was spent on them last year. But agencies say they’re being blamed for NHS mismanagement. Our Health Correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. At Barnsley District General Hospital they’re trying to reduce their reliance on expensive agency nurses. They have their own bank of staff to call on in an emergency. They believe bringing down the costs will require action across the NHS. What’s really positive is there will be a set rate for agency staff and it should limit the competition, because we’re all in competition for those same groups of staff to come and work for us at times when we need them. The amount the NHS in England spends on temporary doctors and nurses has ballooned to £3.3 billion last year. On one occasion an agency nurse cost the NHS £2200 for a 12-hour shift. An agency doctor costs £3700 for a 30-hour shift. That’s unacceptable. We are putting more money in as taxpayers, we want to make sure that money goes on better care, therapy for new cancer treatments, better mental healthcare, all the things we want for the NHS. We can’t do that if this money gets spent on agency fees which are ex-orbitant. The Government wants a maximum hourly rate for doctors and nurses and to ban staff agencies that are not approved. The body that represents agencies says they’re being used as a scapegoat to cover up the NHS failing to properly manage its own workforce. Average agency nurse pay is about £20-25 an hour. The mayor gin paid to the agency is about ten, 20%. The real issue that the NHS needs to address is the lack of staff. Ministers also have their eyes on the pay packets of senior managers, calling for a review of all executive pay at every hospital in England. They also want every trust tojustify any in England. They also want every trust to justify any case where a new senior manager earns more than the Prime Minister. A tidy £1lI2,500. Our top story this lunchtime: The former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has died suddenly at the age of 55. And still to come: Why the world needs a drive for renewable energy to match the space programme of the 1960s. There are more developments in the Fifa bribery scandal. But they deny their General Secretary was involved in a $10 million payment that’s being investigated. Five people have died and hundreds are missing after a cruise ship carrying 458 people capsized on the Yangtze River in China. The ship is floating upside down in a wide stretch of river - it’s believed that survivors may be trapped inside the upturned hull. Police have detained the captain. Our world affairs correspondent jonathan Marcus reports. Listening for any faint signs of life on the upturned hull. And in this case at least there was a response. Rescuers have been cutting their way into the vessel’s dark interior. Fora their way into the vessel’s dark interior. For a few, the lucky ones, there was some escape. This lady, 65 years old, was brought out some 15 hours after the boat went down. The Eastern Star was almost a small cruise ship. There were 458 passengers and crew on the vessel when it was struck by what appears to be a freak cyclone. Those on board were mainly tourists, many elderly. The Chinese authorities have moved swiftly, bringing in military divers and helicopters to assist in the rescue bid. Police troops and specialist teams are all on the scene. At the travel agency that organised the trip, the passengers’ families gathered, desperate for news. TRANSLATION: I am angry. We have no idea whether our relatives are dead. The Government should take us there now. How can these people run away? An official news agency quoted the captain and chief engineer as saying the ship capsized quickly after being caught in a cyclone. Chinese television says the two men are now in police custody. But with local TV reports indicating that winds were raging up to 80mph at the time of the incident, there must be questions, not least as to why the vessel had not sought shelter. The fact that the ship drifted after it capsized, suggests, according to experts, there must be some air still inside the hull, offering a small glimmer of hope that more may be brought out alive. The parents of a missing 13-year-old girl from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire have made a fresh appeal for help in finding her. Amber Peat left her home after a family row on Saturday afternoon with no mobile phone or money. Sian Lloyd is in Mansfield. The family had only moved to this part of Nottinghamshire a year ago, for the past two days though there has been a prison Lens in the street where she lived. -- has been a prison Lens in the street where she lived. -- police presence. Police have been scouring scrubland away from here, as yet, there is no sign of the missing 13-year-old.

Now the police are also very seriously concerned about what might have happened to Amber and there are fears too in the local community. just a few minutes ago people walked past this street and were putting up posters on the lampposts, talking about missing Amber and they’re also on display in local shops. Amber and they’re also on display in localshops. Local local shops. Local people have been joining in some of the searches. There has also been a very strong social media campaign. Her photograph has been exchanged on Twitter and on Facebook. The family had just returned from a holiday, a half-term break in Cornwall. They said Amber had never been happier. They had a fantastic time. They’re so concerned about what’s happened to their daughter now they want her to know she’s not in trouble but they desperately want her home. Thank you. Thousands of pupils will be re-sitting their English GCSEs this morning after failing to achieve a grade C or above last summer. New rules mean teenagers must get a good pass in English and Maths - or continue re-taking the exams until they’re 19. But Further Education Colleges in England say they’re struggling to cope with the cost and the logistics of staging the re-sits. john Maguire reports. This is a way of quickly getting your head back into GCSE English language. These students are about to sit their English GCSE, but not for the first time. Most left school last summer and have moved on to further education, but their English grades were too low, so they are about to resit. It is compulsory now that students under 19 pass maths and English with a C or above. This is my fifth time and it has been stressful. What it means is teenagers are studying subjects at two different levels at the same time. We are the final year project basically and it is so difficult to mix that in with the English work because I have spent so many hours on media that I don’t have many hours for English. I am obviously quite frustrated that I have to do that retake and it is so close to all the other exams. All employers look for a C in maths, especially more than most qualifications nowadays it’s what they really want. This is the main exam room. Not just students feel the pressure. Exeter College ran the resit last summer, a year early, to test the system. And it is proving to be a challenge. To give you an example, we have the GCSE English exam, we are also running AS English Language exams, we have dance and music as well, that means that in terms of buildings, we have a lot of pressure on us having to hire external facilities to support that. And there are other issues. A team of invigilators in place getting ready for some of the first exams of the summer season. It is one of the biggest challenges for Exeter College, doubling the number of invigilators they use, employing as many as 85 this year over the coming weeks. The government believes a good pass in maths and English is the foundation that helps teenagers in their future studies, training and employment. Colleges argue it shouldn’t be one exam fits all. There will always be young people who are not going to achieve that, so the real question is, what is the right qualification for those young people? And our colleges are committed to making sure young people do achieve literacy and you receive qualifications, but we want to see something that is rigourous and reliable, but actually is recognised by employers and parents. And as from September, the topics become more academic. So, the likelihood is more resits and that will require a further rethink. The number of mortgage approvals made to home buyers in April rose to a 14-month high. Bank of England figures show that mortgages with a total value ofjust over £11 billion were given the go-ahead in April- marking the highest number recorded since February 2014. Many lenders have slashed their rates in recent months to the lowest levels they have ever offered. Our Personal Finance Correspondent Simon Gompertz is here. Talk us through the figures. I think it is significant because if you remember that period before the general election there was a lot of talk about the housing market stalling as people wondered understandably about the future and at the top end there was concern about a mansion tax coming in. But what seems to have been happening is that Britain’s house hunters were out there looking at homes and applying for mortgages and getting them approved. In quite large numbers. Let’s at the figures. For that month of April it was 68,000, in fact nearly 69,000 mortgages were approved. That was up from a low in November of 59,000. So it’s significantly higher, although don’t get too excited because if you compare it to the all-time high in 2003, that was 136,000. Not back to pre-financial crisis levels, but going pre-financial crisis levels, but going along nicely. What does this mean, are we in for another housing boom? There is concern still about the shortage of new homes and also about existing home owners not putting their homes on the market and with a recovery that perhaps might produce a squeeze on the housing market again. On the other hand, you mentioned there are a lot of mortgage deals out there, very cheap mortgages at the moment. That’s given house hunters a bit of a spur. If there were to be a worry about the housing market lifting off too fast, the Bank of England has strong powers to prevent too much lending going on. Probablyjust a spring bounce for the moment. Thank you. Creating cheap, clean energy is the greatest scientific challenge facing mankind. That’s according to a group of eminent scientists and economists, who are calling for something akin to the Apollo Space programme to make renewable energy cheaper than coal in every country within 10 years. Our Environment Analyst Roger Harrabin reports. People said it was impossible to put a man on the moon. They were wrong. That’s one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind. Apollo showed earth in it’s fragile puty. The memory of that mission has inspired -- puty. The memory of that mission has inspired -- beauty. The memory of that mission has inspired new urgency in the battle to create our climate. The original project was to put a man on the moon which people thought was impossible and it inspired a generation but it was one country, America trying to do that. Now we are talking about getting the whole of the world working together to produce one clear goal, clean affordable sustainable energy. The global Apollo programme say the amount we spend on developing clean technologies is outrageously low. Their mission is to make clean renewables cheaper than dirty coal. This at last is something which says if we do this, which is practical and comprehensible, we can solve a lot of our problems. And I find that very inspiring and very exciting. Much more investment in storing renewable energy is needed, the group says, like this warehouse full of batteries. Hydrogen stores energy for this car. Solar panels like these on this bridge offer huge potential for further improvement. The extraordinary fall in the cost of solar panels has caught the interest of governments worldwide. The group think that if they can co-ordinate international research they’ll be able to push down the prices of the panels even further. The group says subsidies for wind power and for solar farms like this in Norfolk should be continued because they increase the market and drive down the price. It is a controversial message to a British government that has scrapped support for large-scale solar, and plans to scrap wind power subsidies soon. You’re watching the BBC News at One. The time isjust after The time is just after half past one. Our top story today, the former Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, has died suddenly at the age of 55. In a moment, we’ll have the weather, plus the news where you are. But first, with the sport, here’s Olly Foster. Fifa have denied a report in the US that their General Secretaryjerome Valcke sanctioned a payment of $10 million that is central to the current bribery investigation. Our Sports News Reporter, Ben Smith, is here. Ben, they’ve admitted that a payment was made, but that it wasn’t a bribe. Fifa claim this payment is very much a legitimate payment, one they made to a Legacy fund in the Caribbean, but the US indictment, the US federal investigators, believe this was a bribe paid to secure votes to secure South Africa’s did for the 2010 World Cup. The New York Times has named jerome bout, Sepp Blatter’s right-hand man, someone he knew about this payment, to authorise the payment. Fifa released a payment which they denied jerome Valcke had any knowledge of this. Since then, a letter has come to light suggesting thatjerome Valcke perhaps did know about this, it is addressed by the South Africa publicise years and twojerome Valcke, it mentions this payment. It takes it a step closer to set Blatter’s door. He is a key adviser, a lute and really for Sepp Blatter, and this increases the pressure we have seen building on Fifa in the last week. England cricketers are in trouble at Headingley. New Zealand have got half the wickets they need to level the series on the final day of the Second Test. Let’s cross live to the ground now and speak to our reporter Patrick Gearey, Patrick, England will no doubt be doing a rain dance at lunch. They will. Yesterday, the rain got them out of trouble. By this morning it was gone. They will be hoping returns. They started the day claiming it was not about surviving, but thriving and completing a record run chase. Pretty soon that was all over. They lost early wickets, Lyth and Ballance gone to Trent Boult. Craig, the New Zealand spinner, accounted for Bell and joe Root, both are pretty ordinary shots. England can’t afford to give wickets away in a situation like this. just before lunch, Ben Stokes went. He became England’s fifth wicket. He had shown some resistant and played a view shots, butjust as they got a lunch he lost his wicket. A lot will depend on Alistair Cook, the captain, who is still in at lunch, not out. We hope you lunch as well because they will need him to stay around for a long time this afternoon. 102-5 at lunch. England need to practice sessions. New Zealand need five wickets. That is all the sport now. Let’s return to the news that the former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has died suddenly at the age of 55. Let’s get the thoughts of our deputy Political Editor, james Landale. james, how would you assess his legacy? I think Charles Kennedy was a man of paradox for stop on the one hand, he was a career politician who somehow managed to transcend politics, and appeal beyond his party, beyond here at Westminster. He was also a man who in his day-to-day leadership could be chaotic, and yet when it came to the big issues like Iraq, he was incredibly decisive. He was a man who was known to be gregarious, and to be witty, and yet at the same time, in private, was very shy at times, reserved, and as we know sometimes quite lonely. Also a man who was known for his sincerity, his openness, his authenticity, yet who spent many years being less than open with the British public about his battle with alcohol. Above all, he will be no not for the chat shows, not for the fun and games that he provided to Westminster, but for the fact that he brought his party to its largest electoral success in the post-war era, above all by making a decision to oppose the war in Iraq that in hindsight many people thought was the right decision. james Landale, many thanks. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Tomasz Schafernaker. Tomas, it has been pretty cold recently, but we have had it worse. This was the weather map from around 40 years ago, it was actually snowing. We are not going back to weather symbols right now butjust to give you an idea of how cold it has been on other occasions. This is a picture from the cricket ground in Bucks where it had to be postponed, and it was notjust Bucks where it had to be postponed, and it was not just there. What we had in the last 24 hours was not that bad, that was pretty windy in some places, and I think this afternoon it will remain quite windy, but the sun starting to break through the clouds. This is that area of low pressure spinning around here, the weather front dragging its heels across the south of the country. Over the next few hours, the weather conditions will start to improve in more areas but it will still be on the dusty side. A strong rush of south-westerly winds -- gusting side. The south-west of the country, this is for VM, if you don’t mind the breeze, the weather is not that bad at all, some sunshine around. Feels a bit on the chilly side around the coast. The extreme south-east, parts of East Anglia, a weather front still clinging on to that part of the country with cloud and a bit of rain. But for Northern England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, actually a mixture of sunshine, showers, sunshine again. I would actually a mixture of sunshine, showers, sunshine again. Iwould not be surprised if there were a few cracks of thunder here as well. More of a mixed cracks of thunder here as well. More ofa mixed bag. of a mixed bag. Through this evening, still breezy for a time, but eventually tonight and into tomorrow morning, those winds start to die down. It won’t be particularly cold, around ten or 11 degrees across the South, 6 degrees in northern parts of Scotland. Wednesday, the middle part of the week, not a bad day. It will start to feel a lot better because those winds will be lighter, there will be more sunshine, quite a pleasant day for most of us. Highs getting up to 20 degrees in London, and even in Newcastle getting up to the mid-teens. With light winds and the sort of temperatures it will feel a lot better compared to what we have had in the last couple of days. Then from Thursday onwards, that is when we start to see slightly warmer air wafting up from the south. Temperatures getting up to 22 in London, 19 in Leeds. Even in Newcastle, 17 Celsius. Towards the end of the week, that warm air keeps wafting up from France and Spain, but with that on Friday comes the threat of some thunderstorms. So the warmth on Friday is expected to be across more eastern and southeastern areas, but bear in mind it could come with some thunderstorms, so not necessarily glorious sunshine. It will feel a little warmer but I think it isjust a glimpse of summer. The weekend, however, looking cool and bright. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. The former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has died suddenly at the age of 55. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Good afternoon, I’m Asad Ahmad. A detailed report has found that improvements need to be made to the way officers and prosecutors handle cases of rape. The recommendation follows an examination of the Metropolitan Police, where an ""overwhelming burden"" was found to be placed on detectives. I’m joined now by our Home Affairs Correspondent, Danny Shaw for more on this. Danny. The background to this is that there has been an increasing number of allegations of rape made to police in London. It has gone over-- up by over two thirds in the last decade, which has replaced -- placed an extraordinary burden on officers forced it is a difficult to address, levels of sickness according to this are higher among officers who investigate brake than others in the Metropolitan Police. -- who investigate rape. Successive governments investigate rape. Successive governments have encouraged victims to come forward to report rape allegations, so they should follow through with their policy and provide resources so that police can investigate those cases properly. It is echoed by Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. We have had some support around counterterrorism, cybercrime is coming counterterrorism, cybercrime is coming down the lines towards us, and here in terms of serious sexual offences for the next few years at least we can see there were the more demand. So any support we can receive we would appreciate, but whether we receive it or not, we will have to put a few hundred more officers into this vital area. The report also calls for Losa working between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. It wants to see a new place of safety for victims of the centre of London and also wants clarification of the law so that it is absolutely clear that if someone has drunk so much alcohol that they can’t possibly have the capacity to consent to sex, then that is rape. Thank you for that. Staying with Scotland Yard for a moment, because fat and overweight police officers have been warned they could lose theirjob if they don’t get fit. Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe believes officers who repeatedly fail the compulsory annual fitness tests, have no place in the job. In an interview with the Radio Times, he said the current standard of ""test"" is too low, and at the age of 57, he says HE still manages to pass, without any preparation. England rugby fly-half and Londoner, Danny Cipriani, has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving in Chelsea. The former London Wasps player, who’s now with Sale Sharks, was involved in an accident between his Mercedes and a Toyota yesterday morning. The 27-year-old from Putney was breathalysed and taken to a west London police station. He’s been released on bail. England Rugby bosses are yet to comment. A collection of more than 200 letters written by one of the Kray twins is expected to fetch more than £15,000 pounds at auction today. The notorious brothers ran a gang called ""The Firm"" in the East End of London in the 1950s and 60s. The letters from Reggie Kray are to his ghost writer as they worked on his autobiography. The letters were written while Reggie Kray served a life sentence at Maidstone Prison in Kent. Did you get married or do you know someone who got married on May 16th? Because an amateur photographer from Canada wants to track down this newly married couple who he photographed during his recent trip to London. He saw them kissing, got out his camera - and when he got back - the picture came out so well, he thought the couple might want a copy. So he’s appealing on social media to track them down. A look at the weather now with Kate. Good afternoon. The wind from this morning created some problems for public transport. This afternoon, it does remain rather blustery. The wind staying with us throughout. The Met office still has a yellow weather warning in force, but for now it is parts of Surrey and Kent. The gusty other wind the further south you go. The further north you are, we should get some sunshine by the afternoon and temperatures up to 19 Celsius. Still staying breezy up towards parts of north London and the on, just not quite as strong as the further south you are. Overnight tonight, gradually as we head towards the early hours of tomorrow morning, the wind begins to fall a little lighter. It doesn’t disappear but it will be a little later. Minimum temperatures staying at 11 Celsius. It leads to a bright start for Wednesday morning, some sunshine around for much of tomorrow, it is an improving picture, a drier, drier, brighter, less windy day, temptress feeling warmer at 20 Celsius and gradually through the next couple of days, temperatures will sneak up. For could reach 24, 20 five Celsius, but we will also see one or two downpours. That’s it for now. Victoria will be here with our next news at 6.30pm on BBC One. Until then, I hope you enjoy the rest of the afternoon. # There’s nothing you can do that can’t be done # Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game # It’s easy # All you need is love # Love is all you need # All you need is love, love Marisha, fetch me the blue paisley.

After 32 years as an MP and a leading figure in British politics we will assess his legacy. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. In the last few minutes, the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, has announced he’s standing down. Clamour for his resignation has been growing since Friday, when he was re-elected as President in the midst of the worst corruption case to hit football’s world governing body in its 111-year history. Our special Correspondent Lucy Manning has the latest. The moment are many in football thought would never come. In a hastily convened a conference in Zurich, the man they tried and failed to remove will now go. TRANSLATION: I will call and failed to remove will now go. TRANSLATION: Iwill call and it stored in any conference and put at disposal my function. It is going to be held as soon as possible. A new president will be elected to follow me. As the new president. I will continue to exercise my function as president of Fifa until the new elections are going to be held. They with the raids that shuck Fifa, in America and in Zurich. The repercussions of the dawn raids and the arrests and the allegations of bribery and corruptionjust the arrests and the allegations of bribery and corruption just don’t stop -- bribery and corruption just don’t stop -- they were the rates that shuck Fifa. just days ago he celebrated his re-election as Fifa president despite the best efforts of some including the football Association to remove him. Thank you that you accepted me. That the four years I will be in command. Of this boat, called Fifa, and we will bring it back, we will bring it back off shore. This letter at the heart of the bribery claims, Innard the South African FA asks Fifa to make a payment to support Caribbean football -- payment to support Caribbean football-- in it. jerome Valcke’s name on it suggesting he was asked to authorise the payment. Payment surrounding the 2010 World Cup held in South Africa central to the case the FBI are building against Fifa. With allegations of the money ended UP With allegations of the money ended up in the account of the former vice president jack Warner. Together we 9ÂÂ president jack Warner. Together we go, let’s go Fifa. But now it is time to Sepp Blatter to go, he was the great survivor but no longer. Well as we’ve been hearing, Sepp Blatter has run FIFA for 17 years and despite all the allegations of corruption and wrongdoing, has received strong support particularly in the developing World. Our Sports Correspondent Natalie Pirks looks at his life and achievements. No man in football has ever divided opinion quite like this man. To some he reached out to smaller nations and delivered them untold wealth, to others he is the head of a corrupt regime operating from a board room straight out of a james Bond film. He would never relinquish his iron grip on power. But he’d never relinquished his iron grip on power and this is the moment many in the sport have been waiting for. Blatter always possessed a special ability to side step controversy. Shoulders were simply shrugged at claims of vote buying after his first election win in 1998. In 2010, Qatar’s successful World Cup bid prompted more allegations of corruption. Again, football’s Teflon man rolled with the punches. Crisis? Yes. What is a crisis? The wisdom of his 79 years wasn’t always on show. He’d infuriated female footballers for saying they should play up theirfemininity by wearing tighter shorts. He believed racism could be settled by a simple handshake, and his advice for gay fans, worried about the destinations for the next two World Cups. I would say then that they should refrain from any sexual activities. For a man fond of a maritime metaphor, who insisted he’d steer the good ship Fifa back into calmer waters, the tide had been turning for a while. Amid mounting pressure, key figures - like UEFA president, Michel Platini - had implored him to go. Fifa cannot continue. We cannot continue like this with Fifa. For so long the sport has danced to his tune, this could be football’s new dawn. Natalie Pirks, BBC News. Richard Conway was the only British journalist at the news conference in Zurich, he is on the line now, what was the reaction when he made the announcement? There was a small number of media here today. The reaction mainly came from those members of staff who have loyally stuck by Sepp Blatter for all of these years. They looked diminished and sad, they were clearly aware of something afoot in the build-up. We were told to come to Fifa headquarters at short notice, it was clear something significant was to be announced, Sepp Blatter walked into the room. He made a speech which lasted a little over five minutes and he talked about how his mandate which he won last Friday was not supported by everybody in football. He talked about how he wanted to do his best for Fifa and for the game that he loved. Therefore he said he had decided to resign for those reasons. He will stay on in position until an extraordinary congress can be called of the national associations. It will take place we understand some time between December this year and March 2016. Sepp Blatter departing saying he wanted to press on with fundamental reform, clear reform of the organisation despite all of the scandals and corruption is that have hit Fifa in the last few years and he wants to hit Fifa in the last few years and he wa nts to leave he wants to leave them in better condition. Forthat he wants to leave them in better condition. For that reason he has decided to walk away. Thank you for joining us. Today’s other main story. The Prime Minister has led tributes to Charles Kennedy - the former leader of the Liberal Democrats - who has been found dead at his home in Fort William at the age of 55. Police say there were no suspicious circumstances. Mr Kennedy led his party from 1999 to 2006 and oversaw their best-ever election result. But he resigned after admitting he had a problem with alcohol. Charles Kennedy has been described as a man of ""immense ability"" and a politician with a gift for speaking with ""humour and humility"". Our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale reports - there is some flash photography is his report. Charles Kennedy was that rare thing, a career politician whose trusted by the public. A genial wit, who did not compromise on his principles and an honest man who tried to keep his struggle with alcohol Private. An MP who was universally liked. A man whose death at his home in Fort William has prompted a wave of sadness, notjust in his Highlands constituency but across the world of politics. Charles Kennedy on form, on a good day, feeling strong and happy. on a good day, feeling strong and happy, had more talent in his little finger than the rest of us put together. He led the Liberal Democrats in 2005, to their greatest success in the 1920s, winning 62 MPs, above all because of his and their opposition to the war in Iraq. Charles Kennedy defied consensus and the advice of many in his party by joining millions of protesters and warning of the risks of military action. This is the risk is moment for Britain since the Suez crisis. We have do pursue international justice through the international relations and the United Nations. 20 years earlier, a young Highlander arrived at Westminster. I am enjoying life and breaking the mould. At 23 he was the youngest MP of his day, one ofjust six from the newly formed social Democratic party. We will fight for it. An early supporter ofjoining with the Liberals to create eventually the Lib Dems. My name is Charles Kennedy and tonight I am in charge, people of Britain, get used to it. LAUGHTER Behind the jokes there was a shrewd tactician, using his appearance on prime-time TV shows to appeal beyond Westminster. Charles was a man who went on doing what he did before, speaking in a language people could understand and reaching beyond politics, thinking of his appearances on public occasions which were nothing to do with politics when he was loved. Charles Kennedy... When he replaced Paddy Ashdown as leader, Charles Kennedy led his party to the left of the new Labour Party. We are not anybody’s poodles but we are not what pilots either. He presided over a party machine that ruthlessly won by-elections, his leadership winning the respect of his opponents. It is not often somebody in politics comes along with brain and talent and wit and bags of humanity and he had all of those things. A man known for his sincerity and honesty, was at the same time hiding a long-standing battle with alcohol, a largely secret battle that eventually he could hide in no more. When he got confused at an election news conference. In the region of... 20... Yeah. He admitted everything in a vain attempt to save his leadership. Overthe in a vain attempt to save his leadership. Over the last 18 months I have been coming to terms with and seeking to cope with a drink problem. But his colleagues had enough and he was forced to stand down. Alcoholism is a disease and we should reflect on that and Charles struggled with it and it is hard to struggle with it in the public eye. When Nick Clegg took the Lib Dems into coalition Charles Kennedy was opposed, warning thatjoining the Tories would severely damage the Lib Dems. In public though he kept his concerns largely to himself and continued to speak out for his party not least during the general election. Ido not know where to begin, speaking as a Scot. In the end even he for all of his popularity was unable to stem the SNP tied and he lost his seat of 32 years. This Charles Kennedy, authentic, principled and flawed, a politician who spoke human, and was all too human. Charles Kennedy was an MP for 32 years before he lost his seat at last month’s general election. His former constituency in the Highlands is the largest in the UK and it’s where he lived for much of his life. Our Scotland Correspondent james Cooke is in his home town of Fort William. Yes, everyone Yes, âVâI’yoIâ1â i’1âI’â kind word and a generous thought for Charles Kennedy. Many politicians you might cross the street to avoid, not this one, in the words of his family he was a fine man and a talented politician and a loving father. This was the land of Charles Kennedy, in the shadow of Britain’s highest mountain. He never climbed Ben Nevis, saying he would rather read a book. But his heart was always in the Highlands. He is remembered here fondly. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant and very well thought of and sorry he lost his seat. He was well respected and well liked and had family connections, people liked him. It’s a shame, we have lost an independent mind with clarity of thinking. He was a great UK politician. In the Ben Nevis bakery this former classmate recalls a young man with wit and passion. He was a character, he did the speeches at school. All of the debates. He was quite opinionated. It was nice, I liked him. This photograph shows him as a pupil, playing his trumpet... Charles Kennedy spent more than 30 years in London as an MP but never really left here. This lady was at school with him, she is now the headteacher. He never lost his roots, he came home from London often, he came to the school often to visit us, still part of the school community. One the full girl told me when she was watching breakfast television she saw his name on the screen, she could read the news this morning, she was in tears -- the news this morning, she was in tears -- one little girl. She was in tears because it was not long ago he was in the school. He leaves a child of his own, too, Donald, born 2005 to his wife, Sarah. The couple divorced five years ago but Charles Kennedy was described as a doting father. Forthe Kennedy was described as a doting father. For the former Lib Dem leader the last year, the last campaign was tough, for all of his popularity he was beaten by a turn in the tide. In his heart of hearts Charles knew he was in a fight over the course of the last few weeks. I would want to pay tribute to his great character and his many strengths. He was a human individual, somebody I knew well over a long period. Body who had shown great kindness and friendship too many people -- shown great kindness and friendship too many people -- somebody. Charles Kennedy will be remembered here with genuine affection as a politician of principle rooted in the Highlands, a man of humourand principle rooted in the Highlands, a man of humour and humility. Four teenagers have been seriously injured on a rollercoaster at Alton Towers in Staffordshire - after 2 carriages collided. 16 people were on the ride when the accident happened this afternoon. A special platform had to be built to reach the injured - who were left trapped in the rollercoaster for hours. Daniella Relph reports. Through the loops of the roller-coaster you can see the rescuers at work, these pictures taken almost three hours after the collision. People are still stuck on a carriage of the Smiler ride. Paramedics and fire crews trying to free those trapped and injured. The carriage stopped at an angle, making access and any rescue even more difficult. A platform has had to be built to help to get people off. Video footage filmed in the seconds after the collision, showing how one carriage filled with 16 people crashed into another empty one which was left in its path. MY My God! Slowing the picture shows the empty carriage at the front, but behind, the one which crashed into it, eyewitnesses described what happened. The carriages, two were running, one was at the top of the hill which have broken down and there was one already halfway through the ride. The one of the top was let go but the other one was stuck. You heard a Big Bang and everybody started screaming. The front carriage was crushed and it was hanging over, it was like that. The Smiler roller-coaster opens two years ago and it is a major attraction holding a world record for the most loops in a ride. But it has had an above technical problems in the past, today is by far the most serious -- in the past, today is by far the most serious -- a number of technical problems. Those injured were taken to nearby hospitals and there will be an investigation into how one of Britain’s most popular roller-coaster is failed to ensure the safety of those riding it. Danny Savage joins us now. A terrifying experience for those involved. What is the latest? It’s taken four hours, all of those four most seriously injured people, and everybody else, has been taken off the ride and taken to hospital. That phase of this operation is now over, but the most obvious question has to be - but the most obvious question has to be - how on earth did this happen when so many people appeared to spot the danger before hand? We have taken to eyewitnesses who say they saw an empty carriage on the ride, ahead of the carriage with the people on, they tried to alert members of staff before hand. Still, that carriage came round and hit the empty carriage causing this very nasty accident. Why did that happen? Where were the safety fail safes? Why was it not stopped? That will be part of this investigation. What we will hear from the people involved over the next couple of hours. They will issue a statement down by the ride in the next few minutes as to where their investigation goes and what their thinking is. We await to hear from what their thinking is. We await to hearfrom them. This is an what their thinking is. We await to hear from them. This is an extremely popular theme park. People have been leaving here today very scared about what happened, Sophie. Danny. Thank you. The time isjust after 6. 15pm. Our top story this evening. Later on BBC London: The Russian exile found dead outside his Surrey home - police are accused of incompetence. And counting down to the first ever European Games. We meet the 2012 Olympic star hoping to repeat her medal success. The bitter taste that’s being added to laundry capsules, to stop children eating them. And two uncapped South Africans are included in Scotland’s training squad for Rugby’s World Cup later this year. More than 400 people are still missing after a cruise ship capsized in China during a storm. The vessel’s believed to have sunk within minutes on the Yangtze River. Many of those on board were elderly tourists. john Sudworth reports from the scene injianli. As the rescue teams tap on the hull, they think they’ve heard a response. Raising hopes that some of the more than 450 people on board the stricken cruise ship might be keeping themselves alive inside air pockets. Then came this extraordinary moment. First, the rescue divers emerged and then with them a 65-year-old woman. Brought up to applause from the emergency workers and hauled to safety. She’d been trapped for 15-hours. The Eastern Star is one of many large passenger ships that every year carry millions of tourists, Chinese and foreign visitors alike. It was reportedly struck by a tornado and it sank in minutes. The rescue effort is being co-ordinated from this barge and, as you can see, the lights are burning late into the night. But more than 24-hours now after the boat sank, hopes must be fading that there can be any more miraculous rescues, although the Chinese government isn’t yet prepared to admit as much. TRANSLATION: It’s a race against time. As long as there’s even a little hope, we will give it 100% and we will absolutely not give up. At the travel agency that organised the trip, the passengers’ families gathered, desperate for news. TRANSLATION: I’m angry. We have know idea whether our relatives are dead. The government should take us there now. How can these people just run away? A large boat-load of every day people, enjoying a popular holiday pastime, has been lost on the famous Yangtze River and this is a tragedy that’s being felt right across China. john Sudworth, BBC News, Hubei province. Fears are growing for a teenage girl who’s gone missing after a row with her family. 13-year-old Amber Peat left home in Mansfield on Saturday evening and hasn’t been seen since. Sian Lloyd reports. Amber Peat, described by her parents as a home bird who likes to read. She hasn’t been seen since leaving the family home following a row about doing the chores. Police say the 13-year-old’s disappearance is totally out of character. I heard the front door slam, that’s when I realised. When I went out I couldn’t see her anywhere. She’d just gone. At a news conference her mother Kelly and stepfather, Danny, urged the teenager to get in touch. If you’re watching this, or if anybody knows where she is, just send her home, please. just come home. just let us know that you’re safe or anybody that knows anything, just anything. just come home. From the police too concern for Amber’s safety is growing. They’ve been searching local scrub land, but with no confirmed sighting since 5.30pm on Saturday, they have little to go on. REPORTER: How important do you think getting that message out there is now? Very important. These people don’t know Amber or her parents. Her family have only recently moved to Mansfield. This community is rallying around in the search to find her. A lot of us have kids of our own. We can relate to somehow how they are feeling. It’s the only thing we can do to help. That’s just what everybody is doing. They want to do something to help. Amber went missing the day after the family came home from Cornwall. Her parents said it was one of their happiest holidays. Tonight, they face an agonising wait for news, unable to explain to their two other daughters why their older sister hasn’t come home. Sian Lloyd, BBC News, Mansfield. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories: The Health Secretary, jeremy Hunt, has told the NHS in England that the time for asking for more money is over. Mr Hunt has announced a clamp-down on what he termed the ""rip-off"" fees charged for agency staff. The agencies claim they’re being blamed for the NHS’s own mismanagement. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner has launched a formal inquiry into the conduct of the former Scottish Secretary, Alistair Carmichael. The Liberal Democrat MP has been under pressure after admitting the leak of a memo during the election campaign.

The defeat means the two-match series is drawn 1-1. Our sports correspondent, Patrick Gearey, reports from Headingley. The fortress of white rose country is no place to raise the white flag. England said they could win this, that they’d be brave, not besieged. Fearless words can be made hallow by fine bowling. Trent Boult bamboozeled Adam Lyth then Gary Ballance. England were startled. In came the New Zealand fielders, but Ian Bell hadn’t seemed to notice. He guided Mark Craig’s delivery straight to a kiwi catcher. Two balls later, joe Root went harder but ended up in Tom Latham’s jumper. Same result, 62-4. They lost Ben Stokes too before lunch. The picture was very different for England by lunch, now five wickets down this wasn’t about thriving, but surviving. They had two sessions to get through. Surviving is Alastair Cook’s field. His 50 took more than 150 deliveries worth of sweatless concentration. New Zealand sent for Kane Williamson, a batsman, not usually a bowler, but Cook’s focus suddenly scrambled. With the breeze at his side, Williamson turned English batsmen to dust. Stuart Broad here, gone with the wind. Late in the dayjosh Buttler made 73, butjust before 5.00pm he went too, lbw.

There are showers to Scotland, parts of Northern Ireland and northern England, maybe North Midlands and North Wales. A fresh dawn, really. Not cold, but temperatures down to single figures in a number of places. A cool start to a nice day. The winds not as strong as they have been. It will be dry for nearly all of us. There will be showers in the afternoon to western parts of Scotland. A lovely afternoon to come. The sunshine strong. If you are out in it any for length of time put on sun screen. Some places up into the low 20s. More fine weather for the bulk of the UK on Thursday, particularly England and Wales. Cloudier for Northern Ireland and Scotland, showery rain out here. Feeling cool, mid teens. Further south-east warmer. That warming trend will continue. A pulse of heat from the south. It’s the more southern and eastern parts of the UK that will receive the benefit of that heat. The dividing line between high temperatures and the cooler weather is slightly uncertain. Within that humid air we is slightly uncertain. Within that humid airwe could humid air we could well see some heavy thundery downpours developing as we go through Friday, particularly for parts of East Anglia and the south-east. Showery rain to Scotland and Northern Ireland. We will keep an eye on that weather over the next few days. Potentially we will get warm and humid with the possibility of some storms and Southeastern parts of the UK which are most bright. Sepp Blatter announced he is to accept down as president of world’s football’s governing body, Fifa. This is what the FA Chairman said about the news a short time ago. When I was interviewed leaving the Congress on Friday night I said - this isn’t the end of it. I didn’t think it would be over by the next Tuesday. Clearly, there is something has come out of the events of last week that has made Mr Blatter stand down. Greg Dyke.

Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Victoria Hollins. An independent review of rape investigations in London says that without extra resources, police and prosecutors are in danger of being overwhelmed.

There’s been a big rise in the number of rapes reported in London in recent years, and the Met has pledged to give sex offences the same priority as counter-terrorism. Tarah Welsh reports.

Later on BBC London: Warnings that the Met Police risk being ""overwhelmed"" by rape investigations - unless they get extra resources. And seen for the first time - the damage done to the Kingsway Tunnel after a two-day fire. Good evening. Sepp Blatter - who’s run world football for the past 17 years - is to step down as president of Fifa. His announcement earlier this evening followed the recent arrest of several Fifa officials as part of a major investigation by the US authorities into corruption and bribery. Mr Blatter - who’s 79 - was re-elected just a few days ago and said he would remain in post until a successor was chosen. Live to Fifa headquarters in Zurich and our sports editor, Dan Roan. It’s finally happened. Here in Zurich on Friday, Sepp Blatter was able to celebrate his re-election as Fifa President, the most powerful man in world football, despite the biggest corruption scandal the sport has ever seen. His opponents felt he had been wounded and they have been proven right. His fifth term would last four days. It was the moment football thought it would never see, the resignation of Sepp Blatter. Today, in a dramatic statement from Fifa’s headquarters in Zurich, he broke the news. While I have a mandate from the membership of Fifa, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football. The fans. The players. The clubs. The people who live, breathe and love football as much as we all do at Fifa. The crisis was sparked last week when a US-led investigation saw seven senior Fifa officials, including two Fifa Vice-Presidents, arrested in Zurich on corruption charges. The FBI also raided offices of CONCACAF in Miami. Was this a tipping point, a letter emerged showing Mr Blatter’s right-hand man, jerome Valcke, was aware of a $10 million payment from South African officials to disgraced former Fifa Vice-President jack Warner, a payment described as ""a bribe"". Fifa have strongly denied that jerome Valcke was involved. Now, after a turbulent week, Fifa is looking ahead to a future without Mr Blatter. The decision that he has made today was difficult and courageous. In the current circumstances, this is the most responsible way to ensure an orderly transition. Tonight, sponsors, former players and leading football officials greeted the end of Blatter’s17-year reign as a positive step. This is great news for football. positive step. This is great news forfootball. Forfootball here, it is great news for football around the world. Fifa has been a corrupt organisation for 30 years and at long last we’ve got a chance of cleaning it up. We’ve got a chance of understanding the finances. We’ve got a chance of running it properly. Fifa can be saved if you get the right people running Fifa and, clearly, this is a seminal moment for Fifa. Fundamental change has to be made and they have to get this right. So, the great survivor of football has finally gone. One of the most dramatic downfalls from sporting power complete. Dan Roan, BBC News, Zurich. The pressure on Mr Blatter increased dramatically last week when the US authorities accused some senior Fifa figures of rampant corruption. But Mr Blatter was not among those arrested in Switzerland as part of the investigation. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, reports on the FBI’s decision to act- and the impact on the man who’s run Fifa since 1998. Let’s go Fifa! It’s Blatter who is going, so what has changed in the calculations of the man who four days ago stood victorious and saw himself as the right man to save Fifa but has now come to believe that he’s the wrong one? Perhaps look no further than here. A news conference that was as dramatic as it was unexpected. A country not much interested in football, but with the most powerful law enforcement agency in the world, pitting itself against the most powerful ruling body in world sport. The game, according to the allegations in this indictment, was hijacked, that field that is so famously flat was made tilted. The lI7-count indictment against these individuals includes charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money-laundering spanning two decades. This is the World Cup of fraud. Today, we are issuing Fifa a red card! It was clear from the detail made available in these indictments what the investigators had found. Here at the headquarters of the FBI there’s been no comment yet on Mr Blatter’s decision to quit, norfrom yet on Mr Blatter’s decision to quit, nor from the Internal Revenue Service, ditto the Attorney General’s Office. One thing FBI sources were making clear, was this was not the end of the process, there were many other people still of interest to their investigation. And who knows what role that might have played in Mr Blatter’s sudden about-turn. It’s being reported in the US media that he is now part of the FBI investigation. It is a mighty fall for a man who massively divided opinion in the football world. Was he the autocrat heading UP world. Was he the autocrat heading up a corrupt regime? He was politically agile, a shimmy here and a stepover there to get round all accusations of wrongdoing. Crisis? What is a crisis? His off-colour remarks were legion. He thought racism on the football pitch were best solved by a handshake, he thought the women’s game would become more popular, if only the players were more feminine. His advice to gay fans worried about going to Russia when they host the World Cup? I would say they should refrain from any sexual activities. But the corruption allegations just multiplied with the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to the desert kingdom of Qatar. We are the world’s home away from home... The country that lost out in that bid was the USA. Among the many unknowns, and perhaps ironies, now that Sepp Blatter is standing down, is will the decision about Russia and Qatar be re-opened? jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington. Let’s return to Dan Roan in Zurich. What next in your view for Sepp Blatter? Well, his future remains as uncertain as it ever did tonight. His daughter has spoken to the BBC this evening. She tells us that his resignation is nothing to do with those twin investigations in the United States and in Switzerland. He has said that he wants there to be a period of transition. There cannot be an extraordinary meeting to elect a new President until December at the earliest, four months from now. However, there are reports coming out of the United States, asjon said, that the FBI are now actively investigating Blatter. He wasn’t named in that original indictment document last week, but we understand, orthe document last week, but we understand, or the US reports understand that Blatter is the subject of formal investigations. If thatis subject of formal investigations. If that is the case, that, many people will believe, will be the reason why he has decided to go now. The reason why his downfall came about was not sponsors, it was not Uefa, it wasn’t talk of boycotts of the World Cup, or the words of British politicians in Parliament, it was a criminal investigation in the United States. We are not talking about selecting a new President for Fifa, it is also comprehensive reform of the institution itself. What are your thoughts on that? Well, Sepp Blatter has been here for so long now, 1+0 years at Fifa, 17 of which as President. It is almost hard to imagine football and Fifa without him. It will take some getting used to for this institution for this new era. They have to decide who is going to replace him. It will be fascinating to see whether it will be someone Blatter likes, or whether it’s a European, one of his former opponents, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, for example, the choice of Uefa. That remains to be seen. What is really interesting is this. If it is one of his opponents and they decide there needs to be a re-vote for the World Cup, that there are so many allegations of corruption regarding the World Cups in Russia and in Qatar, that is when the true ramifications of this become clear in the future. The world will be watching. Will it be a fresh start? Or another footballing false dawn? Thank you very much. And for more details of Sepp Blatter’s resignation and its implication go to bbc.co.uk/news. Tributes have been paid from all parts of the political world to Charles Kennedy, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, and one of Westminster’s most popular figures, who’s died at the age of 55. Mr Kennedy led the Lib Dems to their best-ever election result in 2005 - and Nick Clegg- one of his successors - praised his 'unusual gift for speaking about politics with humour and humility’. Mr Kennedy had fought a long battle with alcoholism. No cause of death has been given, but police said it was not suspicious. His family said they were 'devastated to lose a fine man and a loving father’, asjames Landale reports. There are some flashing images in the piece. Charles Kennedy was that rare thing, a career politician who was trusted by the public. A genial whit who didn’t compromise on his principles, an honest man who tried to keep his struggle with alcohol private, an MP who was universally liked. A man whose death here at his home in Fort William has prompted a wave of sadness, not just in his Highland constituency, but across the world of politics. Charles Kennedy, on form, on a good day, when he was feeling strong and happy, had more political talent in his little finger than the rest of us put together. That talent, in part, helped him lead the Lib Dems in 2005 to their greatest electoral success since the 1920s, winning 62 MPs, above all, because of his and their opposition to the war in Iraq. Charles Kennedy defied the consensus and the advice of many in his party byjoining millions of protesters in warning of the risks of military action. Today, across the world, the people are speaking and the Prime Minister and the President have got to start listening. That is our message to them. It had been 20 years earlier that a young Highlander had first arrived at Westminster. I am enjoying life. We are breaking the mould of British politics, that is great fun. At 23, he was the youngest MP of his day, and one ofjust six from the newly-formed Social Democratic Party. Charles Kennedy is going to fight for that. You fight for it, too. An early supporter ofjoining up with the Liberals to create, eventually, the Lib Dems. My name is Charles Kennedy and tonight I am in charge! People of Britain, get used to it. Behind the jokes, there was a shrewd tactician, using his appearances on prime-time TV shows to appeal beyond Westminster. Charles was a man who went on doing what he had done before, speaking in a language people could understand, reaching way beyond politics, you think of his appearances on many, many public occasions which are nothing to do with politics, when he was greatly loved. Charles Kennedy is duly elected... When in 1999 he replaced Paddy Ashdown as leader, Charles Kennedy led his party to the left of Tony Blair and New Labour. The Liberal Democrats are nobody’s poodles. But we are not Rottweilers either. As leader, he presided over a powerful party machine, that ruthlessly won by-elections. His unique leadership winning the respect of his opponents. It is not that often in politics someone comes along with brains, talent, whit and bags of humanity and Charles had all of those things. A man known for his sincerity and honesty was at the same time hiding a long-standing battle with alcohol. A largely secret battle that eventually he could hide no more when he got confused at an election news conference. In the region of 20... Yeah... He admitted all in a vain attempt to save his leadership. Over the past 18 months, I have been coming to terms with and seeking to cope with a drink problem. But his colleagues had had enough and he was forced to stand down. Alcoholism is a disease and people should reflect on that and Charles struggled with it and I think it’s harder to struggle with it if you are in the public eye. When Nick Clegg took the Lib Dems into coalition, Charles Kennedy was firmly opposed, warning that joining the Tories in Government would severely damage the Lib Dems. In public, though, he kept his concerns largely to himself and continued to speak out for his party, not least during the General Election. I don’t know where to begin. In the end, even he, for all his popularity, was unable to stem the SNP tide. ...in years to come, perhaps tell our grandchildren we were there the night of the long sgian-dhus! The night so many Lib Dems fell under the electoral knife and he lost his seat of 32 years. Thus, Charles Kennedy - authentic, principled and flawed. A politician who spoke human and was all too human. james Landale, BBC News, Westminster. Charles Kennedy’s death came just a few weeks after he lost his parliamentary seat in the Scottish Highlands, a seat he’d held for 32 years. He’d lived there for much of his life. Our Scotland correspondent, james Cook, reports from Fort William, Mr Kennedy’s home town. This was the land of Charles Kennedy, Lochaber, in the shadow of Britain’s highest mountain. He never climbed Ben Nevis, saying he’d rather read a book, but his heart was always in the Highlands, and he’s remembered here fondly. Oh, he’s brilliant. Absolutely brilliant local MP. He was very well thought of and I was very sorry he lost his seat. Charles was very well respected. He was well liked. He had a lot of family connection here, people liked him. It’s a shame. I think we’ve lost an independent mind with clarity of thinking. He was truly a great UK politician. In the Nevis bakery, this former classmate recalls a young man with wit and passion. He was a character at school too, he used to do the speeches at school. You know, the open debates. He was quite opinionated then. He was nice, I liked him. This photograph here shows Charles when he was a pupil in this school. This is Charles, playing his trumpet, along with his classmates. Charles Kennedy spent more than 30 years in London as an MP, but never really left Lochaber. Violet Smith was at primary school with him, she’s now the head teacher. He never ever lost his roots. He came home from London often. He came into the school very often to visit us, very much still part of our school community. One little girl told me that when she was watching the breakfast television she saw his name up on the screen. She’s only started to read, but she could read the news this morning, and she was in tears coming to school because it’s not long that ago Charles was in our school. He leaves a child of his own, too. Donald, born in 2005 to his wife, Sarah Gurling. The couple divorced five years ago, but Charles Kennedy was described as a doting dad. For the former Lib Dem leader, the last year, the last campaign was tough. For all his popularity, he was beaten by a turn in the tide. I think in his heart of hearts Charles knew that he was in quite a fight over the course of the last few weeks, and I certainly would want to pay tribute to his great character, his many strengths. He was a very human individual, someone I knew very well, over a long period of time, and one actually, I think, that had shown great kindness and great friendship to many people. Charles Kennedy will be remembered here with genuine affection, as a politician of principle, rooted in the Highlands, a man of humour and humility. Charles Kennedy, the former Liberal Democrat leader, who’s died at the age of 55. Police searching for Amber Peat, the 13-year-old who went missing from her home in Mansfield on Saturday night, have tonight found a body. Our correspondent, Sian Lloyd, is in Mansfield. What is the latest on what the police are saying there? Huw, police have found a body on this housing estate, which is about a mile away from where Amber lived. The area has been cordoned off. There hasn’t been any formal identification yet. Amber’s family have been told. The 13-year-old was last seen leaving the family home at 5.30pm on Saturday following a family row over doing the chores. The police said her disappearance was totally out of character. Earlier today her mother and stepfather spoke through tears as they appealed fo their daughter to come home and for help to find her. Many local people took to the streets, tonight many of them have come here, they are in shock. Her family have asked for privacy this evening. It’s expected that a post-mortem examination will take post-mortem examination will ta ke place post-mortem examination will take place tomorrow. Sian, thank you very much for the update there.

They were among 16 on a ride when their carriage collided with an empty one. For the latest, we canjoin our correspondent, Danny Savage, at the park. It took more than four hours to get the casualties off the ride after the crash today. This is the most serious incident ever to happen here at Alton Towers. A number of people were badly injured during what should have been a fun day out. Emergency services were soon swarming all over the ride Trapped on a roller-coaster more than 20 feet above the ground. after this afternoon’s crash. A day out at this famous theme park had turned to horror as passengers were stretchered off after their carriage hit an empty one ahead of it. It was the empty cart at the top of the loop and then that rocked down and was rocking in to the left of the bottom. Then the full cart came along, about five minutes later, and impacted with a loud bang. Ijust seen his face covered in blood and he were just hanging and the girls were screaming, ""he’s hurt, he’s hurt."" Some people filmed the incident as it unfolded. This shows the carriage with the injured on board, pushing the empty train ahead of it. Oh, my God. This is what they were supposed to be enjoying, an adrenaline ride with 11+ loops, but the track ahead wasn’t clear and there are suggestions that staff were warned that an empty carriage was in the way. Was that the case? I don’t think it would be right and proper to comment on that at the moment. Ithink, you know, as I said earlier, our main concern at the moment is with the care and support that we need to give to the injured people and their families. Alton Towers did stay open for the rest of the day, but tonight it’s been announced that the theme park will be closed tomorrow and it’s understood that some of the people who were on the ride have sustained life-changing injuries. There have been previous incidents on the ride known The Smiler, but today’s was by far the worse and it was nearly five hours after the accident when the last air ambulance left. Danny Savage, BBC News, Staffordshire. Five people are known to have have died, but hundreds are still missing after a cruise ship carrying 1+58 people capsized on the Yangtze River in China. The ship is floating upside down in a wide stretch of river. It’s believed that survivors may be trapped inside the upturned hull. Police have detained the captain as our correspondent, john Sudworth, reports. As the rescue teams tap on the upturned hull, they think they’ve heard a response. Raising hopes that some of the more than 1+50 people on board the stricken cruise ship might be keeping themselves alive inside air pockets. Then came this extraordinary moment. First, the rescue divers emerged and then with them a 65-year-old woman. Brought up to applause from the emergency workers and hauled to safety. She’d been trapped for 15-hours. The Eastern Star is one of many large passenger ships that every year carry millions of tourists, Chinese and foreign visitors alike. It was reportedly struck by a tornado and it sank in minutes. The rescue effort is being co-ordinated from this barge and, as you can see, the lights are burning late into the night. But more than 21+-hours now after the boat sank, hopes must be fading that there can be any more miraculous rescues, although the Chinese government isn’t yet prepared to admit as much. The Chinese Premier, Le Keqiang, has flown in to help co-ordinate ti’Iâ EITIEFQEFICV I’âSpOI’ISâ. A clear sign of how seriously the disaster is being taken. But it’s also potentially sensitive and the Chinese government will be aware of the dangers if its response is perceived as inadequate or slow.

Alexis Tsipras, the Prime Minister of Greece, says his country has made significant concessions to try to reach a compromise deal with international creditors. The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have agreed the terms of a deal, offering financial support in return for major reforms. But much will depend on how the concessions are viewed by the Greek public. Our correspondent, james Reynolds, reports from Athens. MUSIC. For a single night, the lost generation of Greece gets a break from five years of crisis. They’re not following their new government’s negotiations minute-by-minute. When you spend every day on the edge of disaster, you learn to get used to it. We have nothing to lose. 10 years ago, people my age had something to lose. I don’t. So I risk more.

We’ll have your local and national forecast coming up. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at one. After yesterday’s dramatic resignation by Sepp Blatter as president of Fifa, US media is now reporting that he’s being investigated by the FBI as part of their corruption inquiry. Mr Blatter, who’s always denied any wrongdoing, was back at work at Fifa’s headquarters in Switzerland this morning, and says he intends to remain in place until at least December. US officials have been quoted in the American press as saying they hoped to gain the co-operation of some of the Fifa individuals who’ve been charged in order to build a case against Mr Blatter. Well, Christian Fraser is in Zurich. Thank you. When Greg Dyke, the chair of the FA, left us here on Friday evening, his parting shot was that Sepp Blatter wouldn’t be in thisjob for longer than two years. That seemed a bold statement given the defiant rhetoric we were getting from the Fifa President. What changed? Fifa has been coming under more pressure over the alleged bribes that South Africa paid in 2010. Sepp Blatter himself is now under investigation. And later today, we will hear of previously undisclosed testimony of Chuck Blazer. With all the details, here is our spors correspondent, Richard Conway. His report does contain some flash photography. Sepp Blatter’s remaining time as Fifa President can no longer be measured in years. By early 2016, he will be enjoying retirement, or at least that’s what he hopes. With reports he is now part of a wide-ranging American investigation, Fifa is bracing itself for a second wave of criminal indictments, but the fallout continues with the South African government today forced to deny they made a corrupt payment. This is an ongoing matter. We categorically deny that our country and government have bribed anyone to secure the rights for the 2010 Fifa World Cup. After dominating football politics for over Ao years, Sepp Blatter took the decision yesterday to start what he hopes will now be an orderly transition of power. TRANSLATION: While I have a mandate from the membership of Fifa, Ido not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football - the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe and love football as much as we all do at Fifa. We are being kept firmly at arms-length here today at Fifa’s headquarters, but behind me, Sepp Blatter is back at his desk and back to work. As for the power struggle over who who will succeed him, that is already under way. David Ginola was first out of the blocks. The former French international failed in a previous bid but says he will try again. Prince Ali supporters say he remains at the disposal of the national associations after polling 73 votes in last week’s ballot. But could another challenger come from the powerful Asian Confederation? Sheikh Ahmad of Kuwait, a newly-appointed Fifa executive, could run, or be the kingmaker. And then there is Michel Platini, the head of Uefa, the European Confederation. After coveting the jobs for many years, could he be the man to take Fifa forward? Fifa can be saved if you get the right people running Fifa and, clearly, this is a seminal moment for Fifa. Fundamental change has to be made and they have to get this right. The endgame for Sepp Blatter is under way. And he’s determined to salvage what remains of his reputation, but the questions and the problems for him, for Fifa, and for world football remain. Richard Conway, BBC News, Zurich. There were Ti’1âI’â WâI’â SOTTIE from the Sports Minister in South Africa today who said in his view, his country had done nothing wrong. Funneling money towards ""approved Fifa projects"". Therein lies the nub. Where is the line between charity, hospitality and bribery? All these federations were expected to play the Fifa game and that is something they struggle with. Remember, the Federation, when South Africa were bidding, had some particularly opaque rules that were certainly open to abuse. Thank you. The former Editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, has been cleared of perjury at the High Court in Edinburgh. He denied lying under oath during the trial of the former Socialist MSP Tommy Sheridan in 2010. Our correspondent, james Cook, has been following the case. Thank you. Andy Coulson gave evidence as you say back in 2010 at which time he was Director of Communications at Number Ten Downing Street. Did he lie during that case? Did those lies matter? Those were the questions at the heart of this case. In the eyes of the law, the man in the middle, Andy Coulson, is a liar. Five years ago, he told a court he knew nothing about phone-hacking at the news of the world. Last year, he was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones and sent to prison. And yet today, it took a short time for him to emerge acquitted of perjury. This prosecution was always wrong. I didn’t lie. And the prosecution in mY didn’t lie. And the prosecution in my view is a gross waste of public money. I’m delighted that after four pretty testing years, that my family and myself, we have finally had a good day. Andy Coulson gave the evidence for which he was on trial in 2010. His newspaper had run stories about the Socialist politician, Tommy Sheridan and the two came face to face in court. On oath, Coulson denied knowing about phone-hacking, but today the judge ruled that did not affect Sheridan’s conviction and so was not a criminal offence. Lord Burns explained he was throwing the case out because the lies were not relevant and do not amount to perjury. ""I therefore have acquitted him."" Forthe man at amount to perjury. ""I therefore have acquitted him."" For the man at the heart of this case, the prosecution’s actions have been a scandal. I want to know who has been sacked within the Crown Office? They have spent over £1 million of public money, thousands of police hours on a case that apparently they didn’t know what they were doing. That is a shambles. REPORTER: Would you like to say anything to the victims of phone-hacking? Andy Coulson walks free, but tabloid journalism remains in the spotlight. It’s also emerged that the prosecution in Scotland, the Crown Office, have dropped charges against two other Scottish News of the World journalists. The Crown itself has issued a statement, a short statement, simply saying they indicted Andy Coulson on the basis he did lie. The pressure is on the Crown Office to explain what has gone wrong here. Thank you. Plans to speed up the process of taking failing schools in England out of local authority control and turning them into academies are being put before MPs today. Up to 1,000 schools, including all those rated ""inadequate"" by Ofsted, could be affected. The plans also controversially scrap the need for academy sponsors to consult local people on whether they should take over schools. Our Education correspondent, Gillian Hargreaves, reports. The 15 and 16-year-olds at this school in Tottenham have their heads down revising for their GCSE geography exam this afternoon. In 2005, this place was failing, now it is in the top 1%. As an academy school, it is outstanding, something the Government wants for all schools. We are firmly of the belief that becoming an academy gives heads, teachers, governors, the powers to focus on leadership and excellent teaching. We think this is the right thing to do to speed the process up. There are 235 schools in England currently rated as inadequate. In the past five years, 1,100 schools have become sponsored academies. And overall the Government predicts 1,000 more schools will improve as a result of these new powers. Dame joan keeps a close watch on every aspect of her school. She now advises others how to improve. She thinks turning schools into academies isn’t the only way. Academies are one solution, there are many other solutions out there. The school support that the national leaders in education provide are another way forward without one school taking over another. If you have a good local authority, that local authority can provide support and pressure. The Government makes no apologies for wanting these new powers because they say at the moment, it can take more than a year for a failing school to become an academy and they say that is far too long. Children don’t have time on their side. Even a few months in a weak school can severely damage their opportunities. The Government clearly believes academies are the way forward. Others might not share that view. But what every school should be aiming for is strong inspirational teachers, who empower children to learn. Gillian Hargreaves, BBC News. Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire is closed today while an investigation continues into a rollercoaster accident that left four people with serious injuries. Two carriages crashed on the ride known as Smiler yesterday, leaving some passengers trapped for four-and-a-half hours. Our correspondent, Kathryn Stanczyszyn, is there. What do we know about the condition of the four injured people? Well, what we do know is that four seriously injured people were taken to two separate hospitals in the West Midlands following that crash yesterday where they remain. Their injuries were described by the Ambulance Service yesterday as ""potentially life-changing"". We know they were four young people, three teenagers and one person in their 20s, two female, two male, who may be facing different futures from the ones they were expecting. The Health and Safety Executive began its work here last night. It released a statement earlier today saying they are trying to ascertain whether those responsible for operating this particular ride acted within the full requirements of the law, whether there are any lessons to be learnt here and also whether there are any other safety issues to do with any of the different rides here at Alton Towers. I spoke to the Chief Executive of Merlin Entertainments which runs this site earlier on today. He said he and his team are completely devastated. He felt it was the right thing to do to shut the park today, their thoughts are with the victims but also for the future safety of visitors here and safety is that key word, something clearly went badly wrong. The Chief Executive also talked about an automatic braking system thatis about an automatic braking system that is supposed to prevent carriages from crashing into each other in that particular way and that didn’t happen. People have still been arriving here today, not realising it’s shut, being turned away. It is a busy time for the park. Still no word on whether it will be closed tomorrow. Thank you. The rescue search is continuing, but hopes are now fading of any more survivors being found inside a cruise ship which capsized on the Yangtze River in China two nights ago. More than 400 people are still missing. So far 14 people have been rescued, and 18 are confirmed to have died. Our correspondent, Martin Patience, sent this report. For those on board the Eastern Star, it was supposed to be a trip of a lifetime. But now its submerged hull is all that remains visible. A poignant symbol of this national disaster. Cranes have been brought in to stabilise the ship which sank after it was reportedly struck by a tornado. CCTV pictures have emerged of the ship moments before it capsized. Conditions were stormy at the time, lightning can be seen. Back at the rescue scene, there is no shortage of manpower. But all the signs now suggest this is being treated as a retrieval operation. China’s premier has flown in to coordinate the response. He is the nation’s consoler in chief. He is also aware of criticism his government may face if it is viewed to have bungled the operation. The survivors brought to this hospital are among the lucky few. Slowly, details are emerging about the cruise ship’s final terrifying moments. One survivor said it was tossed about violently during a huge storm. He said the boat then capsized so quickly most people had no chance of escape. With little hope of finding anyone alive, anger is building among the relatives of the missing. TRANSLATION: We want the Government to give us a name list so we know whether they are alive or not. We all want to know. The Yangtze River attracts millions of tourists a year. Now, it is the scene of China’s worst maritime disaster in decades. Martin Patience, BBC News, Hubei Province. Well, our correspondent, john Sudworth, has been to the scene of the accident and he sent this. The Chinese Premier called on the emergency services to seize every second, to fight fatigue and to challenge the extremes in trying to rescue people from this boat. There is no doubting that they have the manpower here. Looking around, you can see the giant cranes that they have brought in. All along the banks of the river we have seen the emergency personnel, the soldiers, the policemen, some of them wearing the white forensic suits. There is of course no need to spell out the significance of that. There was a moment of hope yesterday with a tapping on the hull of the ship, the sounds that the emergency services thought they heard coming back and, of course, that extraordinary rescue of a 65-year-old woman who had been trapped in an air pocket for 15 hours. There was hope then that perhaps more people would be saved in that way. You have to say today, overnight, with the news of no more of those sorts of rescues, you have to say hope is fading. Our top story this lunchtime. Under scrutiny - the US media report that Sepp Blatter is being investigated by American officials as part of their corruption inquiry into Fifa. And still to come. Concern over the increase in the number of teenagers struggling with eating disorders. Coming up in sport. The precarious life of a football manager as managerial sackings reach a 13 year high. Scientists seeking to understand the laws underpinning our universe are gearing up again as - for the first time in over 2 years - the Large Hadron Collider is to start running at near full operating power. The huge underground facility - buried beneath the Swiss-French border- was shut down two years ago, so that its power could be increased, allowing what experts are calling a new era in physics. Here’s our Science Correspondent Pallab Ghosh. It is expected to be a new era of physics. The man in charge had this message. Thanks to everyone. And now let’s see the new physics. But he said that the breakthrough would not happen immediately. Do not expect it to be tomorrow or in one month. Be patient. In the corner, a bottle of single malt whiskey, created in celebration of this moment three years ago. Peter Higgs wiped away a tear and researchers discovered the Higgs boson particle. The particle but holds the universe together. But what was that to follow would be even more remarkable. It is possible that a couple of years from now we will look back on this moment and said this was the start of our understanding of 21st-century physics. When we opened up the door to knowing what the majority of the universe is made of. Not what we happen to be made of, but what 95% of the universe is made of. That will be a huge step forward for our understanding. Following its upgrade, the LHC is smashing particles together twice the energy it was before. The development means that from today physicists will be able to see completely new things in the subatomic world. As it they have a new microscope with vastly greater magnification. It is a great moment. Great emotion. I think this is an arrival point because people have been working for years. The current theory explains howjust 5% of the universe works. Researchers hope they will soon find evidence of mind-bending new ideas that involve extra dimensions invisible so-called super symmetric particles and evidence of what researchers call the dark universe. The Prime Minister has said he does not rule out leaving the European Convention on Human Rights. At Question Time in the Commons - the first since the general election - he said the government wanted to change the rules to make it easier to deport foreign criminals. Our political correspondent Chris Mason reports. Meet Kat Smith, elected as a Labour MP for the first time last month, today she will be the first of the new MPs to get to ask the Prime Minister a question. Are you looking forward to it? Yes, I’m feeling anxious about being in the chamber with all that noise and asking my first question. The West End isjust UP first question. The West End isjust up the road but Westminster is just the ticket for a spot of lunchtime theatre on Wednesday. David Cameron rolled up for his 152nd outing answering Prime Minister’s Questions, but the first leading the Conservatives only government. Order. Questions to the Prime Minister. So here we go. The Tories cheering, Labour getting used to what a thumping defeat means. Firstly it means a stand-in leader. I hope he will bear in mind when things go wrong over the next five years, there is no one responsible but him. First of all, we are still clearing up the mess her government left! By ministers can get tricky questions from their own side as well. There is concern on both sides of the house at the proposition that the UK could withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights. When we have foreign criminals committing offence after offence and cannot send them home because of the right to family life, but needs to change. I blog nothing in getting that done. The other big change in the Commons is the arrival of the Scottish National Party. That means their leader here gets to questions every week. Angus Robertson asked about the plight of refugees crossing the Mediterranean. Why does the Prime Minister think it is fair for Sweden and Germany and other countries to accept these refugees while the UK turns its back on them. We have an asylum system and a record of giving people asylum in this country. But we should be proud of. When people are fleeing torture and persecution they can find a home here in the UK. But what happened to the new MP Kat Smith? Cut the Prime Minister informed the house when he expects the UK to regain its AAA credit rating. The first question she asks, about fiscal responsibility and sustainability, I take that as a sign of progress! So have you missed all this, well it is back. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is heading to Brussels in the latest attempt to reach agreement with his country’s international creditors in return for more funding. Let’s speak to our Europe Correspondent Damian Grammaticas who’s in Brussels. Yet another deadline for Greece. Well everyone is waiting to see what will happen because the great Prime Minister will be here this evening to sit down with the president of the European Commissionjohn Torode junker. There will be a representative from the European finance ministers who have the cash that the Greek Prime Minister needs. There has been choreographed sequence of events leading up to this. The German and French presidents met at the beginning the week. Late night talks. They have put together a plan which will be put to the Greek Prime Minister today. This is essentially the last roll of the dice if he wants that money. And he needs it because time is running out fast. On Friday this week 300 million euros of payment are due that Greece needs to make. The Greek economy is stuttering. Money is flowing out of Greek banks fast. So the question is is the deal that will be put to him something that he can accept. He will have to go from here back to Greece to sell that to Parliament. It seems he has a choice, he could keep the promises his radical left government made to win the election a few months ago, or he can take the money which ensures that Greece stays in the Eurozone. It will be a difficult choice for him to make. And this is only something that would tide Greece over for the next few months. We’re talking about a temporary fix for the Greek problem but it would bring relief to many if they can agree something today. Police searching for a missing 13-year-old girl in Nottinghamshire have found a body. Amber Peat was last seen on Saturday evening when she left her home in Mansfield. Officers say they aren’t treating the death as suspicious. Our correspondent Simon Ward is in Mansfield. The number of floral tributes has been increasing through the day close to the place where the body was found. There has been no formal identification but please have confirmed the body was found as part of the search for Amber Peat. It is less than a mile away from where she lived, she left here on Saturday night. Herfamily lived, she left here on Saturday night. Her family said it was out of character for her to go missing in this way. And the principal of her school has spoken this lunchtime. Amber has been a student at the school since September. Academically bright, she has been quiet and loved singing and dancing. She has been happy at the Academy. Students who have been particularly affected are being supported by staff and trained counsellors. This is a close-knit community Academy. And everyone is supporting each other. Hundreds of local people here in Mansfield have helped in the search for Amber. They have been flanked by police and Nottinghamshire police have said sadly this is not the outcome anyone was hoping for. The postmortem examination is taking place today and those results could be revealed later. The head of the NHS in England is to warn the food and drink industry that they must act to cut sugar and stop targeting sugary snacks and drinks at children. Simon Stevens will be addressing the NHS confederation’s annual conference in liverpool this afternoon and our health editor Hugh Pym is there. Of all the issues facing the NHS, why has he picked this one? Well Simon Stephens the NHS England feel strongly that obesity is a major challenge to the NHS and the whole of society. He called it in an interview the other day the new smoking. Diabetes for example, the cost of treating patients with diabetes is around 10% of the budget for the NHS in England. What he will say to the audience of NHS managers is actually aimed to all of us and to a much wider audience. That the NHS on its own cannot cope with the consequences of this. It has to be dealt with by government, I society, patients and consumers and the food and drink industry. For example as he said the other day, the consumption of fizzy drinks by British children is more than their counterparts in any other European country. And sugar consumption is a major problem in his opinion. His message to the food and drink industry is that you have to be aware is more pressure here on producers to look at what they’re offering and to cut back on calories and sugar and salt. There is a strong hint that further regulation could be needed. Sugar tax has talked about, whether that happens a lot would be a major issue of course for government. But the response of the food and drink companies is that a lot has been achieved in the past few years, voluntarily by them are cutting calories and cutting back on salt. And regulation is not the way to deal with it, it is the problem for everyone. But I think it will become a big issue in the world of health policy, how to tackle the rising problem of obesity and the cost associated for it. A problem for the NHS and for government. I think we will hear a lot more about this this afternoon and in the months ahead. You’re watching the BBC News at One. Our top story today. Under scrutiny - US media report that Sepp Blatter is being investigated by American officials as part of their corruption inquiry into Fifa. In a moment, we’ll have the weather plus the news where you are. But first the sport with john Watson. Andy Murray continues his pursuit of a third major title at the French Open this afternoon. He’s expected out on court in the next couple of hours where he’ll face Spain’s David Ferrer for a place in the semifinals. The seventh seed has never beaten him on clay but Murray has enjoyed a recent good run of form on the surface, having won two clay-court titles this season. David is an extremely tough guy to win against. I have watched videos of some of his matches against Novak Djokovic. Novak Djokovic has plagued him well on the play. So I will watch some of those matches to see if I can pick up some things and, with a game plan. And the world number one Novak Djokovic takes on the nine-time champion Rafael Nadal in the day’s other quarterfinal, while Serena Williams hasjust begun her match against Italian Sara Errani in the women’s draw. The former Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has been confirmed as the new manager of Real Madrid, replacing Carlo Ancelotti who was sacked last week. Benitez left the Italian side Napoli on Sunday after two years in charge. He’s enjoyed tremendous success in the game, having won League titles in Spain and the Champions League trophy during his time with the Anfield club. Here in England managerial sackings reached a 13-year high this season, with a record 20 managers dismissed in the Championship alone. Alistair Magowen’s been assessing what’s brought about these changes at the top. Now it will break into full-blown ipy Now it will break into full-blown joy for Arsene Wenger, who makes history. He wins a record-equalling sixth FA Cup. Arsene Wenger has been wielding power at Arsenal for 19 years, making him the longest-serving manager in England by a decade. Premier League bosses, Gus Poyet, Alan Irvine and Neil Warnock are among those who have lost theirjobs this season. In addition, there’s a dozen resignations. That’s 200 families, thatis resignations. That’s 200 families, that is a lot of people who have lost theirjobs. Here at Arsenal’s stadium, youngsters are getting advice on a career in the industry. With sackings reaching a 13-year high, football remains precarious. Since 2002, it has been a bumpy road for managers in the top four divisions. 20 sackings have come from the Championship alone. Why the spike? It is either a manager getting sacked as a knee-jerk reaction, ora getting sacked as a knee-jerk reaction, or a manager walking out. You might not have heard of Les Reid, but he has only sacked one manager in his time at Southampton. He says clubs make a mistake by letting managers interview them. That may be where the clubs make a mistake. They should be looking at what kind of club do we want to be in ten years’ what kind of club do we want to be in ten years’ time and what kind of coaches and managers do we need to get us to that point? And build a job description around that vision. Further down the ladder, Notts County chairman says the reasons are for financial. County chairman says the reasons are forfinancial. He’s for financial. He’s fired seven managers in five years. When the fans become disgruntled with a particular manager, they don’t turn UP particular manager, they don’t turn up through the turnstiles, it affects the revenues the business generates, so we have to take notice. Arsene Wenger has shown longevity can bring success, but the chances of a manager lasting as long as the Frenchman appears slimmer by the season. That’s all sport for now. Back to you. The number of hospital admissions of teenagers with eating disorders has nearly doubled in three years - according to new figures from the NHS. Medical experts say one possible factor behind the rise is the growing pressure social media puts on vulnerable teenagers. Newsbeat reporter Daniel Whitworth has more. Unhealthily underweight. A model poses for Yves St Laurent in a photo which appeared in one of Britain’s biggest fashion magazines. An advert which is now banned for being irresponsible. But for Freya, it wasn’t pictures in glossy magazines that made her worried about how she looked. Instead on her smartphone, she was able to access millions of photos on social media which put her under pressure to drastically change the way she looked. I was really into fitness. I wanted to have a really toned body. It wasn’t really about being skinny. From following all different social media apps, that I used as motivation to get fit or whatever, I just got terrified of touching certain foods, and the weight really started going down. Freya, just how bad did things get for you? My organs were failing completely. You really are minutes away from dying. If you don’t have these checks done, you know, you could pass away in your sleep. It is horrible, really. It did affect the whole family. What can you do, you can’t make the child eat. So we were watching her getting weaker and weaker and it was devastating, really. She became an alien to us. She was not our daughter. Her thinking was totally different. And it was like having a complete stranger in the house. The number of hospital admissions across the UK of teenagers just like Freya who are fighting eating disorders has gone up nearly 90% in just three years. From 959 in 2010-11 to 1,815 in 2013-14. Whilst the numbers involved are relatively small, medical experts say that rate of increase is being mirrored in a much larger number of cases that do not reach hospital. We are getting increasingly concerned about the pressure of social media and literally with one click of a button very vulnerable young people are able to access tens of thousands of images of perfect looking people. Which places them under a lot of pressure. The advice for anyone who might be dealing with similar issues is to talk to a friend, a parent, a teacher or a doctor. just talk to someone you trust. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Tomasz Schafernaker. There are some complications with the weather forecast for Friday. We will have a look at the details in just a second. Today and tomorrow, it is marvellous out there for most of us. Lots of bright sunshine around. Not completely clear blue skies. We have a bit of fairweather cloud bubbling up. On balance, it is a fine day. It is still a little on the fresh side. It is not all that warm. Some of those coastal areas, only 12 or 13 degrees. It is starting to warm UP 13 degrees. It is starting to warm up now across other parts of the country. Like yesterday, we could nudge up to 21 degrees across the south of the country. Coastal areas, a little fresher. Wherever you are, 99% of the country is going to stay dry. So, a nice evening on the way as well. It will be a little on the fresh side for some of us. A clear night. A bit of mist first thing in the morning and one or two pockets of rain, particularly in the north-west. As I say, it’s a dry night, a clear night. 12 in London, single-figure temperatures across other parts of the country. Tomorrow, for England and Wales, it’s a beautiful day. It is warming up. The warm air is coming in from the south. It is not the case everywhere. Look at that, Scotland and Northern Ireland, here we have cooler, fresher conditions, 13 degrees in Glasgow. The warmer air is reserved for the south of the country. If you were watching the bmmu country. If you were watching the forecast yesterday, the warmer air was coming in from the south - that still remains the case. There is a threat of some thunderstorms. It is not glorious sunshine. You will see some thunderstorms rumbling through the South East through the morning. Across the Midlands, it should be a fine day on Friday. Look at this. Scotland and Northern Ireland, a lot fresher here. There is an area of low pressure. That will shunt a breeze and thicker cloud. What that low is going to do through the course of Friday into Saturday, it is going to grab all of this cooler air in the North Atlantic and move it in our direction. This is what it translates to for the weekend. It will be mostly dry, but we are not anticipating any heatwave. Look at these temperatures, 21 in London. In the North, more like the teens. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime. Under scrutiny - US media report that Sepp Blatter is being investigated by American officials as part of their corruption inquiry into Fifa. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC London News, I’m Louisa Preston. All Metropolitan Police officers are set to get cameras to wear on their uniforms. Boris johnson believes they will help fight crime and boost public confidence. The move will make the new technology available to more officers in a single city than anywhere else in the world. Well, our political correspondent, Karl Mercer, joins me now. What sort of number of cameras are we talking about? By this time next April, 20,000 neighbourhood police officers and response teams will have these cameras. This follows a year-long trial starting in May last year, in ten London boroughs, so far 1,000 officers have had these cameras and they are uploading 6,000 hours of video every month. That is kept on file for 30 days unless it is used for criminal evidence, in which time it will get deleted. The Mayor said this morning rolling this out, we hope, will help boost the confidence of Londoners in the Met. I really think this is potentially game-changing technology for us in London. Forthe police, it will build confidence in the public and in our police officers, men and women themselves. They will know what they are doing and saying is being recorded. They are hoping these cameras will offer lots of benefits? A win-win is the way they see it. It will give the public confidence. They will know in stop and search that they are being videoed at the time so it may help officers act more correctly. But also they are saying it might increase the number of guilty pleas because criminals know they are being caught on camera. Thank you.

Alberto Salazar is accused of violating anti-doping rules and being involved in doping- one of his former athletes speaks out for the first time.

NHS hit squads are sent in to take over all of Essex’s hospitals and ambulance service. And Scotland Yard rolls out body cameras to virtually all its front-line officers. as his perjury trial collapses. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. One of the world’s best known athletics coaches is tonight at the centre of doping allegations following a BBC investigation. Alberto Salazar is accused of violating anti-doping rules. Among the allegations, it’s claimed he was involved in doping the American long distance runner Gaylen Rupp. Alberto Salazar trains both Gaylen Rupp and Britain’s Mo Farah at his base in Oregon in America. But there is no suggestion that Mo Farah has broken any rules. The allegations against Alberto Salazar have been made by a number of former athletes and staff. Mr Salazar and Galen Rupp both strenuously deny any wrongdoing. Mark Daly has this exclusive report. Can it be a 1-2 for the Salazar group? It looks like it. It looks like it, as Mo Farah takes gold for Great Britain! Gaylen Rupp take second. This was the crowning moment for Alberto Salazar. His two biggest stars taking gold and silver at the London Olympics. A US legend himself, Salazar as head coach at the prestigious Nike Oregon project. Home to Mo Farah since 2011. But now a number of former athletes and staff who worked with Salazar have made allegations to the BBC about unethical practices and the use of banned steroids. Steve Magnus was Alberto Salazar’s assistant coach. In 2011 he says he saw a lab report from back in 2002 relating to US 10,000 metres record holder Gaylen Rupp. And he took a photo of it. It had, currently on testosterone medication. When I saw that, I kind ofjumped backwards a little. Like, waita minute, on testosterone medication? Testosterone is obviously banned. I mean, I knew that. Everybody knew that. In response Alberto Salazar said the document was incorrect. He says what had been recorded as testosterone medication, a banned anabolic steroid, was actually a legal nutritional supplement called Testoboost. Both he and Gaylen Rupp strenuously denied Rupp had ever used testosterone. As part of a year-long investigation, I’ve heard a number of other allegations, including that Salazar experimented with testosterone to see how much would trigger a positive drugs test. Manipulated anti-doping rules on medical exemptions. And encouraged prescription drug use to help performance and weight loss. Cara Goucher is probably the most famous female athlete in America. She and her husband Adam, both Olympians, were coached by Salazar for seven years. They told me they witnessed anti-doping violations as well as unethical behaviour by Salazar. He is sort of a win-at-all-costs person. It is hurting the sport. You were very close to Alberto Salazar. Mm-hmm. How difficult is it doing this interview today? It’s really hard. For years he was a super important person in my life. I mean, I literally loved him. I loved him. He was like a father figure to me. So it feels like a betrayal, a little bit. But I feel really bad about that. But he put me in this position. I showed the allegations to David Howland, chief executive of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Are you disturbed by what I’ve told you? Totally. I would be not only disturbed, I would be disappointed. And that’s why I think it needs to be scrutinised by us as an independent body. Alberto Salazar, who has been a consultant for UK athletics for two years, told the BBC: I believe in a clean sport and methodical dedicated approach to training and have never, nor ever will endorse the use of banned substances. I have always strictly followed World Anti-Doping Agency rules. No athlete within the Oregon project uses a medication against the spirit of the sport we love. Gaylen Rupp said: I have not taken any banned substances. And Alberto has never suggested that I take a banned substance. There is no suggestion that any other Oregon Project athletes, including Great Britain Mo Farah, have broken any anti-doping rules. But if the allegations about Alberto Salazar are true, then Mo Farah has been coached to world success by a man who has used banned method. Mo Farah told the BBC that in his experience, Alberto Salazar and the Oregon Project always strictly followed the WADA rules and that he himself had never used banned drugs. Mark Dalyjoins us now. Mark, the man at the centre of these allegations is his coach, so what does this mean for Mo Farah? Of course Mo Farah is the most successful current track star for the UK. He needs to choose the company he keeps very carefully. I spoke to Andy Parkinson who until recently was the head of UK anti-doping. What he told me is that every athlete, even star athletes like Mo Farah, have to make sure they are ina like Mo Farah, have to make sure they are in a safe environment and can guarantee they are able to compete mainly in that environment. Now there is no suggestion that Mo Farah has broken any rules Lord is there a suggestion that Mike has been involved in wrongdoing. But there are serious questions over the coach and questions also perhaps for the governing body since UK athletics has not only entrusted their prized asset to the Oregon project since 2013, Alberto Salazar has been a consultant to the running elite squad. I spoke today to UK athletics to make them aware of the allegations and they said they would refrain from any comment until they had seen the full programme. You can see more of Mark Daly’s investigation into drugs in sport on the Panorama Special, Catch Me If You Can, at 9pm tonight on BBC1. Two of the most seriously injured victims of yesterday’s rollercoaster crash at Alton Towers have been named. joe Pugh and his girlfriend Leah Washington were on the ride when it hit an empty carriage at high speed. They are being treated along with two others in hospital for severe trauma to their legs. Sian Lloyd is at Alton Towers. The theme park has been shut today and it will remain closed tomorrow. It is dashed the owners described the accident yesterday as the worst in its 35 year history. 18-year-old barman joe in its 35 year history. 18-year-old barmanjoe Pugh and in its 35 year history. 18-year-old barman joe Pugh and 17-year-old barmanjoe Pugh and 17-year-old Leah Washington was sitting in the front row of the roller-coaster when the ride went horribly wrong. The couple are amongst the four people left seriously injured in the crash yesterday. Today all carriages on the £18 million attraction were grounded. Alton Towers theme park closed to all visitors. This is how the ride looked when emergency services rushed to the scene after two carriages collided. Experienced paramedic Peter Howell led the rescue organisation. It was like a road traffic accident had taken place in midair, 25 feet in the air. We had two young men with head and chest injuries, two young women with severe leg injuries. It took more than four hours to track -- severe leg injuries. It took more than four hours to track -- to free the trapped passengers. They were screaming not because they were having fun but because the way in immense pain and terrified. So what went wrong? A passenger carriage and empty car were both on the right when they should not have been. Winters is sold the carriages collided at the top of the loop. They heard a loud bang. The ride has a top speed of 50 miles miles an hour. Alton Towers said today that the car was travelling at 20. Safety braking systems should have prevented two cars ever being on the same piece of track. But that did not happen. This mobile phone footage shows the cars continued at a pace after the crash, eventually coming to a stop at the bottom of the roller coast. Whilst the health and safety executive investigates, the park must wait for answers. Our Hearts are still with the people injured. It is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of this part. It is still not known whether a technical issue or human error they do part in the crash. -- played a part in the crash. A post-mortem examination is taking place after police searching for a missing 13-year-old girl in Nottinghamshire found a body last night. Amber Peat was last seen on Saturday evening when she left her home in Mansfield after a row. Officers say they aren’t treating the death as suspicious. judith Moritz reports. Amber Peat fell out with her parents after a row but after she stormed off, she was never seen again. Her body was found last night less than a mile from her home. Her deficit community hard. Her school friends have come to leave tokens near to where she was found. I just wanted to give some flowers to say thanks. It isjust the to give some flowers to say thanks. It is just the fact that she went to school. We all felt we needed to do something, to give something. Whether to help to look for her or just a respect. As a community we needed to show something. This is web the body of Amber Peat was discovered three days after she went missing. Hundreds of people were involved in the search for her and today some said how surprised they are but she was found in the middle of such a busy residential area. It has emerged that Amber took her own life. Amber was found by two police officers searching an area in Mansfield. Her body was out of sight and would not have been apparent to anyone in the nearby area. Her mother and stepfather would like to say that they were touched by the amazing response from the local community. People turning out in their hundreds to help search for Amber. Amber had just returned from holiday with her family. Tonight they said they would treasure the memories of it. Up to a thousand schools in England - including all those rated inadequate by Ofsted - will be turned into academies, under a new law published today. The Education and Adoption Bill aims to speed up the process of turning failing schools into academies, by abolishing the rights that parents and campaign groups have to appeal. House prices have increased by 0.3% in the last month - to reach another record high. The Nationwide says the average home in the UK is now worth more than £195,000 - up more than £2,000 on the previous month. Interpol have issued wanted notices for some former Fifa officials. It comes after the surprise announcement yesterday from Sepp Blatter that he would step down as president of Fifa. For many this was the first day of a bright new dawn for football, but still Fifa finds itself at the centre of a storm. The world’s media descended on its headquarters here in Zurich this morning, as the sport begins to take stock after the downfall of its most powerful figure. President Sepp Blatter’s dramatic resignation last night a seismic moment for the game. So why did Sepp Blatter decide to go just four days after being re-elected? The pressure that began a week ago with the dramatic arrest of senior football officials eventually seems to have proved decisive. And with reports that Sepp Blatter himself is now part of a wide-ranging American investigation, Fifa is bracing itself for a second wave of criminal indictments. Interpol is now involved, issuing an alert for two former Fifa officials, meaning they risk arrest anywhere they travel. But the fallout from the crisis continues, with the South African government today forced to deny they made a corrupt payment over the hosting of the 2010 World Cup. The fact that a payment of 10 million rand US dollars was made to an approved programme, above board, does not equate to bribery. We understand that Sepp Blatter had been told by some of his closest confidence that he had to step down. Today he apparently received a standing ovation at the headquarters. So who could be Sepp Blatter’s successor? Prince Ali ofjordan, last week’s defeated candidate, is thought to be interested. Second favourite, Michel Platini, head of European football’s governing body Uefa. Power broking Sheik Akmal of Kuwait meanwhile could also be a serious contender. While others say they need more time. I will decide if I present again or not. But I think it’s an important moment for all the key persons, the federations and associations, to think a little bit. So what next for Fifa? Questions have been raised over whether there should be a sensational revote on the controversial awarding of the next two World Cups to Russia and Qatar, especially after today’s news that the FBI are scrutinising the decision. Despite the huge popularity of its flagship tournaments, the reputation and credibility of Fifa is at an all-time low. After the last 17 years of Sepp Blatter’s rule, repairing the damage will be no easy task. Our North America Editorjon Sopel is in Washington for us now. jon, can you tell us more about the FBI investigation? It is worth recapping where we have got to. 11+ individuals indicted last week. The FBI were interested in many others. Yesterday, confirmation that Sepp Blatter was forming part of the investigation. Today, Reuters is reporting the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar are also part of the inquiry. If that is correct, that is a significant widening of the investigation. Then, later today, we are expecting the transcript of the evidence given by Chuck Blazer, the form American Fifa executive who has already pleaded guilty to corruption charges and then carried a wire-tap. To say that that transcript is keenly anticipated would be to put it mildly. Thank you. Our top story this evening: One of the world’s best known athletics coaches, Alberto Salazar, is tonight at the centre of doping allegations. And still to come: In China 400 people are still missing after a cruise ship capsized. Later on BBC London. The Government moves to turn all failing schools into academies. Campaigners say its un-democratic. And are we one step closer to the 'Garden Bridge’ over the Thames? A legal action against the plans is now off. Andy Murray leads in his French Open match with David Ferrer, but he has lost the third set. The head of NHS England has called on people to take on more responsibility for their own health or the National Health Service won’t be able to cope. Addressing the NHS Confederation’s annual conference in Liverpool, Simon Stevens said a ""national conversation"" was needed to tackle obesity in particular and the NHS shouldn’t be left to tackle the consequences alone. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym has more. Eating, drinking, smoking- lifestyle choices. Today there was a high level call for all of us to make the right choices because if we don’t, the NHS won’t be able to cope with the consequences. After his Conference Speech, the head of NHS England told me society as a whole had to take responsibility for tackling obesity. If we don’t take action, then we will have a huge wave of diabetes, and heart disease, and cancer, amputations, blindness affecting our kids. That is not what any of us want as parents. Could that mean Government needing to regulate? It will take a combination of action by parents, by schools, by society, potentially by Government, certainly by the food industry, and I think that’s the big conversation we now need to have. He’s even been out to look at school dinners, including those where the health message has already got across. We hide vegetables, in cakes, in chocolate and beetroot. We do courgette ones. Everybody’s happy. You find them in every town and city, clusters of fast-food shops, but our desire for cheap, high-calorie food could be creating a long-term financial crisis for the NHS because of the effect on our health. That was the message from the head of NHS England. Mr Stevens sees sugar as a big part of the problem. British children consume more fizzy drinks than their counterparts in other European countries. He thinks companies must make products healthier, but the industry says it is already doing its bit. We’ve taken action on calories, we’ve taken action on salt, and we have also looked at labelling, so we have been heavily involved, notjust over the last five years, but for many years in tackling obesity. The NHS chief thinks responsibility extends across a range of health conditions, including dementia. Here a supermarket has installed a special dementia till to make it easier for people to do their shopping. The idea being to help them live independently without needing the NHS. And that’s what today’s challenge is all about, consumers and food and drink companies, possibly pushed by Government, have to change their ways if they want a sustainable NHS. Hugh Pym, BBC News. More than 400 people are still missing after a cruise ship capsized on the Yangtze river in China two days ago. Hopes are now fading of finding any more survivors. So far only 14 people have been rescued, and 18 are confirmed dead. Our correspondent jon Sudworth reports from janli. Its upturned hull is still visible but more than two days after the cruise ship sank, very few of the 456 passengers have been found. There’s no doubting that they have the manpower here. just looking around you can see the giant cranes that they have brought in and all along the banks of the river we have seen the emergency personnel, the soldiers, the policemen - some of them, large numbers of them in fact, wearing the white forensic suits - and there’s, of course, no need to spell out the significance of that. This video footage from another passing ship shows the Eastern Star on the night it capsized. The weather is clearly stormy and less than an hour later, the ship was reportedly hit by a tornado. Late tonight, these rescue workers brought their day’s searching to an end, scouring the banks of the murky Yangtze River. TRANSLATION: We are 20 kilometres downstream from the boat. We’re looking for bodies here, not survivors. The Chinese Premier is still at the scene, coordinating the search and consoling the few who did get out alive. But among the relatives of the victims, there’s growing anger. Around 30 or so gathered in Shanghai to call on the government to give them more information. At the moment, though, there seems little to give. More than 400 bodies remain unaccounted for and their recovery will be both difficult and distressing. john Sudworth, BBC News, on the Yangtze River. The former editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, has been cleared of perjury at a court in Edinburgh. The trialjudge, Lord Burns ruled there was ""no case to answer"" after Mr Coulson’s lawyer argued that the evidence he gave at the trial of Tommy Sheridan in 2010 was not ""relevant"" to the outcome of that trial. In the eyes of the law, the man in the middle, Andy Coulson, is a liar. He told a court he knew nothing about phone-hacking at the News of the World. But last year, he was convicted on phone-hacking charges and sent to prison. And yet today, afterjust a few minutes in court, he was cleared of perjury. I’m obviously delighted by the judge’s decision today. It was the right decision. This prosecution was always wrong. I didn’t lie and the prosecution, in my view, was a gross waste of public money. Andy Coulson gave the evidence for which he was on trial back in 2010. His newspaper had run stories about the Socialist politician Tommy Sheridan and the two jousted in court. But, in the end, the truth did not matter. At the High Court in Edinburgh, the judge ruled Coulson’s lies were not relevant to Sheridan’s conviction and did not amount to perjury. Tommy Sheridan disagrees and wants a prosecutor fired. Who’s getting sacked? I want to know who’s getting sacked within the Crown Office. This has been a disaster. This has been a waste of over £1 million of public money. There needs to be a public inquiry. REPORTER: Would you like to say anything to the victims of phone-hacking? So, Andy Coulson walks free but tabloid journalism remains in the spotlight. Prosecutors have also in the past 4 hours dropped charges against two other Scottish News of the World journalists and the Crown Office have given more of a response tonight to some of the criticism against them, insisting it was in the public interest to put this case before a court and insisting what happened had no bearing on Tommy Sheridan’s conviction. The extraordinary spectacle of Tommy Sheridan and Andy Coulson uniting this evening to say the same thing but the Crown have more questions to answer. MPs have been paying tribute to the former Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, who died on Monday, at the age of 55. His ten-year old son Donald was in the Commons public gallery with other members of his family to hear the sentiments. Nick Clegg said the House had lost one of its warmest wits and most loyal parliamentarians. David Cameron remembered the start of Charles Kennedy’s career. just a year earlier, he had been asked by his careers adviser what he was going to do in his life. He replied that he could be a teacher or a journalist, but if all else failed, there was always politics. So, on his election his old careers adviser wrote to him saying, ""I can only presume that all else failed."" I remember when he first came to this House aged only 23, the golden boy from the Highlands. He shone in this Chamber. He was elected so young and it’s a tragedy that he’s died so young. He treated the necessary but often tedious detail of policy discussions within the Liberal Democrats with the same attitude he viewed Ben Nevis in his own constituency - something to be admired from afar, but a trial to be endured by others. If you make a life in politics, you can meet some remarkably decent, honest, very highly-principled people and people like Charlie Kennedy will leave their mark on this House for many years to come. My sympathies also go out to his family and friends. Tributes to Charles Kennedy who died on Monday. Time for a look at the weather. Here’sjon Hammond. The weather is going to change from place to place and from day-to-day over the next few days, so keep an eye on the forecast. It was a nice day on the beach today in Sunderland, for most of us it’s a fine evening out there. The odd shower across the far north. Later on in the night, the cloud will thicken, a bit of dampness for Northern Ireland. Underthe thicken, a bit of dampness for Northern Ireland. Under the clear skies, temperatures will fall. 10s and 11s in towns and cities. Rural areas, 2 or 3. and 11s in towns and cities. Rural areas, 2 or3. So areas, 2 or 3. So another chilly dawn. But it will soon warm up with a lot of sunshine for England and Wales. Northern Ireland and Scotland, a bit more complicated. More cloud around. The potential for some showery bursts of rain through the heart of Scotland for a time and later on the west of Northern Ireland. No great amounts. Across the border, lots of lovely sunshine. A bit of fair weather cloud around, but plenty of blue sky. Strong sunshine, put on some sunscreen if you are out in it. A bit warmer than today, 22 or 23 to the north of London. And the heat builds even more as we go into Friday. A lot of uncertainty about this. It’s parts of the South East which are likely to see the warmest weather. A lot of cloud from the get-go on Friday. So showery bursts of rain, some rumbles of thunder. It could brighten for a time. Some more storms developing late on in the day across the far South East. We will keep a close eye on that. Head westwards, much cooler. A slice of sunshine through central parts on Friday. But another band of rain extending into South West England, Wales and look at that for Scotland, a lot of rain, very cool indeed, it could brighten up later on across Northern Ireland. What about the weekend? It starts off quite blustery with some showers around. But it will settle down. A reminder of our main story: One of the world’s best known athletics coaches, Alberto Salazar, is tonight at the centre of doping allegations. That’s all from the BBC News at Six - so it’s goodbye from me - and on BBC One we nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you are. Tonight on BBC London... NHS hit squads are sent in to take over all of Essex’s hospitals and ambulance service. We have to look at everything that is available for patients and the public in an area. Then think about what sort of service changes will be required so that the quality of care goes up. Scotland Yard is to roll out body cameras to 20,000 front-line police officers. Trialling them for the past year, but now it is claimed there will be more body worn cameras in this city than any other in the world. A London borough is told it risks 'criminalising the homeless’ after passing legislation allowing it to fine rough sleepers. And the aspiring artists on show at the Royal Academy’s Summer Exhibition. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. All hospitals in Essex and its ambulance service are to be taken over by NHS regulators. It’s because health services in the county have been found to be failing and all previous attempts to turn them around have been, in the words of the Chief Executive of NHS England, ""tested to destruction"". Simon Stevens has also said that ""radical change"" could be needed. Our Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, reports. For years it’s hospitals have struggled. It’s ambulance service, too, has faced criticism. Now, all of Essex’s health care is to be overseen by a government team. Worries that things are not improving have meant the NHS is now sending in a new manager to help run the whole of the county. It’s the first time this power has ever been used. It’s called, believe it or not, the Success Regime. What it mea ns What it means is that instead of just looking at how the hospital is doing in isolation from how well the community health service is doing, we have to look at everything that is available for patients and for the public in an area. And then think about what sorts of changes will be required so the quality of care goes up and we make good use of money that taxpayers are providing. ",,

Alberto Salazar is accused of breaking anti-doping rules, one of his former athletes speaks out for the first time. He’s sort of a winner at all costs person. It’s hurting the sport and if the sport is to be saved it can’t keep going on the way it is. It’s claimed Salazar was involved in doping the American long distance runner Gaylen Rupp. Both men strenuously deny any wrongdoing. Britain’s Mo Farah is also trained by Salazar in the US but there’s no suggestion that the Olympic gold medallist has broken any rules. He’s told the BBC he’s never taken a banned substance.

And the 21/7 would-be bombers are to have their convictions reviewed by Europeanjudges. Good evening. One of the world’s best known athletics coaches is at the centre of doping allegations following a BBC investigation. Among the claims is that Alberto Salazar was involved in doping Galen Rupp, the American long-distance runner. Both Rupp and Great Britain’s Mo Farah are part of Salazar’s training base in Oregon but there’s no suggestion that Mo Farah has broken any rules. The allegations come from a number of former athletes and staff. Alberto Salazar and Galen Rupp have strenuously denied any wrongdoing. The BBC’s Mark Daly has this exclusive report. Can there be a one-two for the Salazar group? It looks like it. Mo Farah takes gold. Gaylen Rupp takes second. This was the Crowning moment for Alberto Salazar. His two biggest stars taking gold and silver at the London Olympics. A US athletics leg-end himself, he is head coach at the prestigious Nike Oregon Project. But now a number of former athletes and staff who worked with Salazar have made allegations to the BBC about unethical practices and the use of banned steroids. Steve was Alberto Salazar’s assistant coach. In 2011 he says he saw a lab report from back in 2002 relating to US 10,000 record metre holder Gaylen Rupp and took a photo of it. It had currently on testosterone medication. When I saw that I kind ofjumped backwards a little. Wait a minute, like, on testosterone medication? Testosterone, obviously is medication? Testosterone, obviously is banned. I knew that, everybody knew that. In response, Alberto Salazar says the document is incorrect and says what had been recorded as testosterone medication, a banned steroid, was actually a legal nutritional supplement. Both he and Gaylen Rupp strenuously denied Gaylen Rupp had ever used testosterone. As part of a year-long investigation I have heard a number of other allegations, including that Salazar experimented with testosterone to see how much would trigger a positive drugs test. Manipulated anti-doping rules on medical exemptions, and encouraged prescription drug use to help performance and waeth loss. This is probably the most famous female athlete in America. She and her husband Adam both Olympians were coached by Salazar for seven years. They told me they witnessed anti-doping #1ri8 owe layingses as well as unethical behaviour -- allegations. He is a win at all costs person. It’s hurting the sport. You were very close to Alberto Salazar. How difficult has it been doing this interview today? It’s really hard. For years he was a super important person in my life. I mean, I literally loved him. I loved him, he was like a father figure to me. So, it feels like a betrayal a little bit. Ifeel me. So, it feels like a betrayal a little bit. I feel really bad about that. But he put me in this position. I showed the allegations to the chief executive of the World Anti-doping Agency. Are you disturbed what I have told you? Totally. I would not only be disturbed, I would Totally. I would not only be disturbed, Iwould be disturbed, I would be disappointed and that’s why I think it needs to be scrutinised by us as an independent body. Alberto Salazar, who has been a consultant for US Athletics for two years, told the BBC: I believe in a clean sport and a methodical dedicated approach to training and have never nor ever will endorse the use of banned substances. I have always strictly foul followed world anti-doping -- I have always strictly foul followed world anti-doping -- strictly followed rules. Gaylen Rupp said: I have not taken any banned substances. And Alberto Salazar has never suggested that I take a banned substance. There is no suggestion that any other Oregon Project athletes including Mo Farah have broken any anti-doping rules. But if the allegations about Alberto Salazar are true, then Mo Farah has been coached to world success by a man who has used banned methods. Mo Farah told the BBC that in his experience Alberto Salazar and the Oregon Project always strictly followed WADA rules and he himself had never used banned drugs. Let’s go live to Glasgow and Mark is there for us. You underlined again in your report Mo Farah, no suggestion of any wrongdoing. Yet, this is his coach being accused. What is your reading of it? Well, Mo Farah is Great Britain’s most successful current track star. So, he has to choose the company that he keeps very carefully indeed. On that issue,in very carefully indeed. On that issue, in my documentary I spoke to Andy Parkinson who until recently was the head of US Anti-doping. He saysis was the head of US Anti-doping. He says is that every athlete, even star athletes like Mo Farah have a responsibility to make sure they are in an environment in which they can compete clean. We have been clear that there are no suggestions Mo Farah has broken rules, nor is there a suggestion that Nike is implicated in wrongdoing. However, there are some questions, serious questions for Mo Farah’s coach, Alberto Salazar. Some questions too perhaps for this country’s governing body, UK Athletics. Not only have they trusted the Oregon Project with their most prized asset, Alberto Salazar has been a consultant to UK Athletics for the past two years. When I spoke to them and made them aware of the allegations they said they would not be commenting until they had seen the whole programme. So we await their response now. Thank you very much. The same investigation by BBC Panorama has uncovered allegations of drug-taking by the British athlete Alan Wells, who won Olympic gold in the 100 metres at the 1980 Moscow Games. Alan Wells has never failed a drug test and has been an outspoken critic of doping cheats. He strenuously denies the allegations, as Sarah Smith reports. Alan Wells is one of three British athletes to win gold in the Olympic 100 metres. His victory in Moscow in 1980 confirmed him as one of Scotland’s sporting heros. In the years since then he has been an outspoken critic of drugs cheats. Now his own past has come under scrutiny. The allegations, which have never been made public before, include the sworn testimony of three men who knew him well as well as transcripts of secretly recorded conversation with a former team doctor. Drew McMaster who ran in the famous Flying Scotsman quartet with Alan Wells has admitted using banned steroids. We were eclipsed by Wells. Should we believe you? I had a very established and brilliant career. Was my life enriched? Yes. Bitter? No. McMaster had secretly recorded conversations with lingham in which the doctor admits to supplying Wells with banned drugs. In the transcripts of those conversations he is asked if Alan Wells was getting steroids or stuff from him? He replied that he, Wells, was taking stuff from all over the place, notjust me and that taking stuff from all over the place, not just me and that everyone knew Wells took drugs. In a statement Wells’ lawyers denied that any drugs were provided by the doctor and said: Alan Wells strenuously denies using banned drugs. His lawyer said: Alan Wells was subjected to the rigorous drug testing regime applied at the time. Wells added before the final he raced at an event where there had been testing. If you missed tonight’s Panorama special Catch Me If You Can, you can see Mark Daly’s investigation into drugs on sport on the BBC iplayer. Fifa’s former top official in the USA - Chuck Blazer- has admitted taking bribes in relation to the hosting of at least two World Cups, including South Africa in 2010. Blazer’s admission was made in 2013 but the court papers which include his evidence have only been released in the past couple of hours. Our correspondent Nick Bryant has the latest from New York. These are the winning bids now part of the FBI’s global dragnet. The US authorities revealing this evening that they’re now looking into how Fifa awarded the World Cup to Russia and Qatar. But a figure at the heart of the investigation is an American, Chuck Blazer, who is notjust a Fifa power-broker but one of its biggest cheerleaders. Fifa is doing an excellentjob of promoting football around the world. If I look back ten years, 20 years and see the progress we have made, I am proud of our accomplishments. Forthe past we have made, I am proud of our accomplishments. For the past three years this businessman with a love of Parrotts has been singing like a Canary, telling the US authorities who he -- Canary, telling the US authorities who he -- what he knows about alleged corruption at the highest level and acting as an FBI informant who used a microphone hid nona key chain to secretly record meetings - hidden in a key chain. This journalist broke the story. The FBI and an agent from each agency found him on a street in New York and told him that they could His lifestyle included this flight with Nelson Mandela and in his blog reads like a cross between a sticker album featuring all-time greats and the celebrity magazine Hello. During a meeting at the Kremlin Vladimir Putin told him he looked like Karl Marx. But a former colleague who has been watching this saga closely, says he was a fraudulent capitalist. Chuck was corrupt from the get-go. There wasn’t a single relationship that he had in world football that wasn’t about Garnering silent wealth on to himself and wasn’t about as a result jeopardising on to himself and wasn’t about as a resultjeopardising the sport’s ability to take care of the most vulnerable. Chuck Blazer spent his millions from racqueteering and money-launder, notjust within millions from racqueteering and money-launder, not just within one luxury apartment in New York, but two, the second for the use of his cats. And that would alone cost ili,000 a month. Presidents, Princes, even Popes, Chuck Blazer has met them all but it’s his relationship with this man, Sepp Blatter that will now come under scrutiny. Our North American editorjon Sopel is outside FBI headquarters in Washington DC. Difficult to exaggerate the impact of these documents? Reading through them, two things really stand out. One is the time scale. The first first bribes and kick backs taken in 1993 going right the way through until 2010. The other thing, just how widespread it seems, reading the documents, how many other people were involved in the schemes to defraud. There is one phrase that he uses again and again in this deposition, which is, ""I and others on the Fifa executive committee."" Which others? It doesn’t spell it out. Presumably, the people who work in that building behind me do know. Now, we know they have extended their investigation to take in Sepp Blatter. The head of Fifa who is standing down. We have learnt also that they’re going to extend the inquiry into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. This investigation is extending and I’m sure an awful lot of the people who are close to this will be sleeping rather restlessly in their beds tonight. Huw. jon, many thanks again. jon Sopel there for us in Washington. Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire is to remain closed for a second day as health and safety officials continue their investigation into a crash on a roller-coaster yesterday. Four people were seriously injured on the ride called The Smiler, which is famous for its multiple loops. Merlin Entertainments, which runs the park, said it was ""devastated"" by what had happened as our correspondent, Sian Lloyd, reports. 18-year-old student and part-time barman, joe Pugh, and 17-year-old, Leah Washington, were sitting in the front row of the roller-coaster when the ride went horribly wrong. They were among the four seriously hurt. A carriage full of passengers collided with an empty car. It took almost five hours for the injured to be freed. Clearly saw thatjoe had been put on a stretcher. Good sign was that he was sat up. You hope he is OK. You pray he is OK and you send your best wishes to his family. Today, all rides on the £18 million Smiler attraction were grounded. Alton Towers closed following yesterday’s rescue operation, led by experienced paramedic, Peter Howell. It was like looking at a road traffic accident that had taken place midair, at 25 foot up in the air. We have two young men with head and chest injuries, two young women with very severe lower leg injuries. It’s very, very difficult to actually deal with. This mobile phone footage shows the momentsjust after the cars had collided. Everyone on the ride was screaming and we thought, well, that’s what you do on a roller-coaster. Then everyone realised that they weren’t screaming because they were having fun on a ride, they were screaming because they were in an immense amount of pain. They were distressed and absolutely terrified. So what went wrong? Witnesses saw the two carriages collide at the top of a loop. They heard a loud bang. The Smiler has a top speed of 53mph. Alton Towers said today the car was actually travelling at 20mph. Safety braking systems should have prevented two cars ever been on the same piece of track. But that didn’t happen. These pictures show how the two cars, now locked together, continued to move at a pace following impact. Passengers were swung around the loop a number of times until the car came to a halt at the bottom of the roller-coaster. The owners of the theme park have been working with members of the Health and Safety Executive to try to find out why it did happen. Our hearts are still with the people that were injured in this. It’s the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of this park. Alton Towers remains closed tomorrow while investigators look at whether a technical issue or human error was to blame. Sian Lloyd, BBC News, Staffordshire. Police in Nottinghamshire have confirmed that the body discovered in Mansfield yesterday is that of the missing schoolgirl, Amber Peat. They revealed that the cause of death was hanging. The 13-year-old went missing from her home at the weekend after returning from a family holiday as our correspondent, judith Moritz, reports. Amber Peat fell out with her parents over doing chores. They thought it was a normal teenage row, but after she stormed off, they never saw her again. The 13-year-old’s body was discovered last night, less than a mile from her home. Amber’s death has hit this community hard. Her school friends have been coming to leave tokens near to where she was found. Ijust wanted to give her a few flowers to say thanks, really. I think it’s just the fact, obviously, because Amber went to Kieria’s school, I think we all felt that we all needed to do something, to give something, whether it was to help look for her, orjust pay our respects. I think, as a community, I think we needed to show something. This is where Amber’s body was discovered, three days after she went missing. Hundreds of people were involved in the search for her and today some have said how surprised they are that she was found in the middle of such a busy residential area. It’s emerged that Amber took her own life. The body discovered in Mansfield last Tuesday evening, yesterday night, has been identified as that of missing teenager, Amber Peat. The cause of death has been confirmed this afternoon as hanging. Amber was found by two police officers searching an area off Westfield Lane at Mansfield. Amber’s mum and stepdad, Kelly and Danny, would like to say in particular that they were touched by the amazing response by the local community. People literally turning out in their hundreds to help search for Amber. Amber had just returned from a holiday with her family. Tonight, they said they’d treasure the memories of it. judith Moritz, BBC News, Mansfield. The United States has warned Russia that an increase in fighting today in eastern Ukraine could lead to ""additional costs."" Moscow in turn has accused Ukraine of ""provocative actions."" The fighting was the worst in the region since a peace agreement was reached back in February. It centred around the town of Maryinka, near the main crossing point into rebel territory. From near the town our correspondent, Tom Burridge, reports. On part of the front-line today it at least felt like the war was back on. GUNFIRE. It sounded like it too. Even though the firing in eastern Ukraine has never really stopped, despite the supposed peace deal. It’s the heaviest fighting we have witnessed in several months. In a village, just back from the front-line, Sasha, Katya and their young daughter, Anya, take shelter under ground. 10-year-old Anya says she couldn’t go to school today because of the shelling. TRANSLATION: It’s so scary. I can’t bear to listen. I want it to finish soon. Her mother, Katya, tells us the family have nowhere else to go, so they’ll stay here until the bombs stop. Today fighting raged around Maryinka, a town next to the main check point to cross the front-line. This is a road we’ve travelled down dozens of times over the last few months. It’s a road that civilians use every day to go from government-controlled Ukraine into rebel-controlled territory to visit their relatives or to go to work, but within a matter of hours the dynamic, at least in this part of this region, has changed significantly. Who controls Maryinka tonight is unclear. Today’s fighting - filmed here by pro-Russian rebel troops, was concentrated in one place - but the fear is that things could escalate further and it will test the faith of leaders in European capitals to the West who are trying to negotiate with Russia for peace. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in eastern Ukraine. Andy Coulson, David Cameron’s former Director of Communications, has been cleared of perjury at the High Court in Edinburgh. The judge dismissed a case in which Mr Coulson was accused of lying about his knowledge of phone-hacking at the News of the World. Mr Coulson had been charged with lying under oath when he appeared as a witness in a separate trial. But the judge decided the alleged lies were not relevant to the case, asjames Cook reports. Did the man in the middle lie and did it matter? In a Scottish court, Andy Coulson denied claims of phone-hacking at the News of the World, but last year he was convicted in London on phone-hacking charges and sent to prison. Yet today, afterjust a few minutes in court, he was cleared of perjury. I’m, obviously, delighted by the judge’s decision today. It was the right decision. This prosecution was always wrong. I didn’t lie and the prosecution, in my view, was a gross waste of public money. Andy Coulson gave the evidence for which he was on trial back in 2010. His newspaper had run stories about the socialist politician, Tommy Sheridan, and the two jousted in court. Sheridan was found guilty of perjury and then Coulson was put on trial for the same crime. But in the end, the truth did not matter. The judge, here at the High Court in Edinburgh, ruled that Andy Coulson’s alleged lies were not relevant to Tommy Sheridan’s conviction and so did not amount to perjury. Tommy Sheridan disagrees and wants a prosecutor fired. Who’s getting sacked? I want to know who’s getting sacked within the Crown Office. This has been a disaster. This has been a waste of over £1 million of public money. There needs to be a public inquiry. Tonight, the Crown defended the decision to bring the case to court saying it was in the public interest. REPORTER: Would you like to say anything to the victims of phone-hacking, Mr Coulson? But as Andy Coulson walks free, the actions of prosecutors and journalists remain in the spotlight. james Cook, BBC News, at the High Court in Edinburgh. Tennis, and Andy Murray is through to the semi-finals of the French Open. He beat Spain’s David Ferrer in four sets. To get to the final, Murray will have to beat the World Number One, Novak Djokovic, who knocked out Rafael Nadal in straight sets. It’s only the second time in 11 years that Nadal has lost a French Open match. Parliament has been paying tribute to Charles Kennedy, the former Liberal Democrat leader, who died on Monday at the age of 55. Among those listening to the tributes in the public gallery was his 10-year-old son. Mr Kennedy’s dedication to public service was praised by MPs, as was his kindness and sharp sense of humour. Mr Speaker, he was the most human of politicians, and in the words of Charles Kennedy himself, the vast majority of people think there’s a hell of a lot more to life than just politics, and you’ve got to bear that in mind because you’re actually trying to represent them. At his best, he was the best that politics can be. I remember when he first came to this House, aged only 23, the golden boy from the Highlands, he shone in this chamber. He never lost his temper in dealing with people. He was always polite. He used the power of argument to win his case. He was one of those great politicians who would absolutely love to have a blazing row with you in the House of Commons, and a chirpy pint with you in the Stranger’s Bar half an hour later. I’m glad to say that he was one of the last of that great tradition which said you should best address political problems in the atmosphere of a smoke-filled room, which has been lost today. LAUGHTER. While we all remember Charles as a formidable parliamentarian and a much-loved politician, it is worth remembering that he retained his greatest pride and devotion for his family. I would like the message to go out to his son that he should never cease to be proud of his father, the best of the political class and the best of men. Here, here. Tributes to Charles Kennedy, the former Liberal Democrat leader, who died on Monday. Newsnight is on BBC Two.

Does that mean I can do anything? Yes, it does. Later on BBC London: Police launch an investigation into claims of wrongdoing ahead of this week’s new mayoral elections in Tower Hamlets. And the religious groups protesting over plans to scrap permits for places of worship in Ealing. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The family of 17-year-old Leah Washington - one of four people seriously injured in the Alton Towers roller-coaster crash - has revealed that she has had to have her left leg amputated after the accident last Tuesday. This morning the theme park in Staffordshire reopened for the first time since the collision between two carriages on the Smiler ride. Our correspondent Andrew Plant is there. Over the last five days while the parkis Over the last five days while the park is being closed there has not been a lot of information about the condition of the four people sitting at the front of the Smiler roller coasters but we have had an update this morning. 17-year-old Leah Washington had her left leg amputated and her friend I8-year-old joe Pugh suffered from two broken knees. Open again after almost a week the public pouring into Alton Towers today as investigations into last Tuesday’s accident continue. Inside a major part of this park is closed, the Smiler roller coasters in the ex-sector deserted, the cause of the crash currently under investigation. 17-year-old Leah Washington was in the front row of the roller coasters, her left leg has been amputated above the knee and she has fractured her hand. I8-year-old joe Pugh suffered two broken knees and extensive hand injuries. And a 20-year-old is described as being in a serious but stable condition. All were treated at Royal Stoke University Hospital’s major trauma centre. The fourth person in the front carriage is described as stable. While some say they are staying away today, many are undeterred, saying that they still feel safe on the rights. Even though it was a really bad accident we are still happy to be here. There is probably more chance dying in a car crash on the way here than on a ride. It is one of these crashes that probably could have been helped but it wouldn’t stop bus coming. The chances of it happening are so slim, it’sjust one of those things. There are still plenty of good rides here, most of the great ones are still open so it will be a good day. 16 people were injured last Tuesday, four of them seriously went to cars collided. The Health and Safety Executive has taken away the carriages and they will be examined as part of the investigation. The rides at Thorpe Park and Chessington world of adventure, which have the same owners, are also closed until it is clear what went wrong. The Smiler ride, one of the park’s main attractions, will stay closed until the cause of the crash has been found. The management at Alton Towers has already said this morning it is deeply saddened by the news that Leah Washington has had to have her left leg amputated. They have already said they will support her and the other victims of this crash throughout their rehabilitation, and they added they will not have to fight, or go through any anguish over compensation. Andrew, thank you. Conservative MPs have reacted angrily after David Cameron said he expected ministers to support his position on staying in a reformed EU. Downing Street said reports that Mr Cameron would ""demand"" ministers support him during the referendum campaign were wrong. Chris Mason reports from Westminster. The question for the Cabinet isjust the same as the question for the rest of us: Are you yes for in, or a note for out? The government’s policy is to renegotiate our policy with Brussels and then recommend staying in the EU.-- no for with Brussels and then recommend staying in the EU. -- no for out. Summeraround the staying in the EU. -- no for out. Summer around the table may want to get out but could arguing for that cost them theirjob? I think it is a mistake the way the Prime Minister has done this and it’s unfortunate because he’s done more to bring about a referendum and set about European reform than any Conservative leader the decades including Mrs Thatcher. We are united as a party knowing where we are going, by 2017 we are going to have a referendum and then it’s not UP have a referendum and then it’s not up to the Prime Minister or me or other parties to decide, it’s up to the British people so let’s not prejudge. It was very different Ao years ago when we last had a say on our relationship with the European club. Government ministers back then to campaign how they liked. But what happened in 1975 is rare, because there is a long-standing convention. When you become a minister you are bound by what is known as collective responsibility, in other words, you sing from the government’s hymn sheet. Whatever happens, if the Prime Minister doesn’t get what he wants and doesn’t get the reform that he wants in Brussels, and again I think that is very, very, very unlikely. But if he were to fail in that ambition he would recommend no to the British people. As world leaders meet in Germany President Obama is raising a glass to voting yes. I look forward to the United Kingdom staying as part of the European Union because we think its influence is positive, notjust for Europe but the rest of the world. The President’s itinerant of the UK staying on the global stage that staying in the EU is vital but he doesn’t have a vote and you do and this debate is onlyjust starting. Let’s speak to our assistant political editor Norman Smith whose at the G7 summit in Germany. It isa It is a little confusing. What is the Prime Minister’s stance? I wish I could give you a clear and definitive answer but I can’t. What I can tell you is the Prime Minister’s view is thatjournalists such as myself and others here have wrongly reported his stance on the EU, following a briefing Mr Cameron gave to myself and other Westminster journalists which we emerged from to report that he was going to insist on government unity over any EU deal he reached. This morning we’ve been told by the Prime Minister’s spokesman we have wrongly reported his views. In point of fact he was referring to government unity, purelyjeering the renegotiation process he is currently engaged in. He was not talking about the referendum campaign itself. I have to say we have slightly been left scratching our heads because it’s not entirely clear why any Conservative would want to campaign against a renegotiation process before you actually know what the outcome to that process is going to be. Yesterday the primers that told us that his clear aim was to get a better deal and if he got that to argue for us to remain in the EU, and that was a government position and the government would not be neutral about this. And as I say, none of us were exactly spring chickens, and yet we all seemed to get the wrong end of the stick. My only gut instinct is the decision to round on we journalists has only gut instinct is the decision to round on wejournalists has been a result of before city of the response of some Conservative MPs to our reports, with one, David Davis, saying it has been turned into a bitter argument within the Conservative Party. A massive man-hunt is underway in New York state for two convicted murderers who used power tools to escape from a maximum security prison at the weekend. They managed to cut through steel walls and pipes. Officials say it must have taken them days. They’ve offered a £65,000 reward for information leading to their arrest. Keith Doyle reports. Imposing, intimidating, and, up to now, escape-proof. Known as Little Siberia, this is the maximum security Clinton Correctional Facility in New York state. Hundreds of police officers are now involved in a huge search for the two prisoners who broke out over the weekend. Road blocks are in place, helicopters and search dogs are being used, as homes and outbuildings throughout the area are checked. It is feared the men may have crossed the border into Canada, just 20 miles away. The two used power tools to cut through the steel walls of their prison cell. They dropped through a maintenance shaft, broke through a wall and cut through pipes to get into the sewage system, before breaking out through a manhole to reach the outside. In their cells, they padded their beds with clothes, and where they escaped they left a taunting note. ""Have a nice day."" David Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole for killing a police officer. Richard Matt killed and dismembered his former boss. These are very dangerous individuals. The State Police asks that the public take no chances, make no efforts to apprehend them, and report any suspicious activity. Clinton Correctional Facility has nearly 3,000 inmates, and is guarded by 1,400 officers. While the search for the men is going on, the authorities are asking how they managed to execute such a sophisticated plan. A $100,000 reward has been offered for information leading to theircapture. This might seem like a daring, audacious escape, but the police have warned the men are dangerous and capable of very grave crimes. Keith Doyle, BBC News. Two women who think they should have received bigger divorce settlements have taken their cases to the Supreme Court in a landmark hearing. They say their husbands deliberately kept quiet about how much cash and assets they actually had. The case could set a precedent for the future if people can prove they were intentionally misled by former partners. Our legal correspondent Clive Coleman. How significant could this be? Very, in a word. This goes to the heart of our divorce system. It’s about honesty, honesty when identifying financial assets on divorce and whether if you tell a deliberate lie, or try and hide your assets or try and minimise them the court order that approves your settlement can simply be set aside and the whole thing we negotiated again. In one of the cases a woman called Alison Sharland accepted a settlement from her Internet entrepreneur husband Charles. That may seem a huge amount of money but it later transpired that he had misled the court in relation to the true value of his company and the fact it was going to be floated on the stock market. She went to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal said, yes, he did deliberately mislead the court but it wasn’t significant and didn’t affect the amount you were going to get. She has appealed to the Supreme Court and today in that case and in that case and another case joined with it, the Supreme Court has started to consider whether in effect we have a divorce system that tolerates some fraud, orwhetherany fraud, divorce system that tolerates some fraud, or whether any fraud, any lie at all means you can in effect rip UP at all means you can in effect rip up the court order and re-negotiate your entire divorce financial settlement. Clive, thank you. A group of cabin crew are planning legal action against British airlines saying they have been poisoned by contaminated cabin air. The workers - both former and serving crew - believe they have fallen sick after breathing in fumes mixed with engine oil and other toxic chemicals. The Civil Aviation Authority says incidents of smoke or fumes on planes are rare and there is no evidence of long-term health effects. jim Reed reports. A flight to New York from Florida last month. Fumes fill the cabin, passengers cover their mouths. See that smoke in the plane. This is the most visible form of what the industry calls a fume event. Around half the air you breathe in most modern commercialjets is re cycled. It goes round and round the cabin. The other half is drawn through here, the engines. Normally that is not a problem, but if there is a fault in the seal of these engines, that is where some people think engine oil and other toxic fumes could be sucked up from here, into the cabin itself. Airlines say fume events are very rare, but we have obtained full safety reports, submitted to the CAA. Since April last year, there have been 251 reports of fumes on flights operated by British airlines. In 104 cases an illness was reported. Oxygen was given on at least 28 of those flights. The detailed logs, which have not been made public until now, show some pilots were made so sick they couldn’t operate. On other flights, every crew member was sent to hospital. April 13th, 2015 - Airbus A320, Heathrow. Oily smell in the cockpit intensified post-landing. At A&E, crew reported feeling things felt unreal and slightly confusing. Both pilots were considered unfit to operate. February 29th, 2015 - Boeing 747. Fumes in the cabin. During the cruise the senior crew manager informed the captain that nine cabin crew were reporting similar symptoms. These consisted of dizziness, nausea and headaches. One cabin crew member collapsed and was administered first-aid and oxygen. Former stewardess Dee Passon was made redundant after a long sickness she blames on contaminated air. You think it isjet lag, or it is just getting older, and you don’t realise that, until your body completely breaks down and grinds to a halt, you don’t realise you are ill. You just keep putting it down to whether things. Campaigners are waiting for the outcome of two high-profile inquests. Richard Westgate and Matthew Bass both worked for British Airways. Both died after long illnesses, which their families blame on toxic fumes. The Unite union, which represents cabin crew, has opened a dedicated legal unit and is preparing 17 more legal cases against airlines in the civil courts. Plane-makers and airlines say there is no proof of any long-term damage from breathing cabin air. In 2013 group of independent scientists reviewed the evidence for the Department for Transport. The levels were often as normal or even more than those in the home or in the workplace. This is in normalflight. Of course, we can’t be sure what the levels are in so-called fume events, which are very rare. Lawyers working in this area are now comparing toxic air to other industrial health scares. If you look at the tobacco industry, the asbestos, contaminated blood issues, if you look at all that, governments say it is perfectly safe, perfectly safe and then wham, suddenly they have to admit, "" ""We got it wrong for so many years"". So that is going to happen again with aerotoxic, no doubt about it. Is the air we breathe at 30,000 feet a genuine threat to staff and paying passengers? That is likely to be decided one way or another in our courts in the months and years to come. Our top story this lunchtime: Alton Towers theme park has reopened after the rollercoaster crash - one victim’s family reveals she’s had to have her leg amputated. And still to come - confusion from motorists over Later on BBC London: We hear from London’s 400 metre world champion Christine Ohuruogo ahead of this summer’s Games in the Olympic Park. And making a splash - 80 years of spray painting is celebrated for the first time in a new exhibition in the capital. At the G7 summit in Germany, world leaders are meeting for the second and final day. On the agenda - climate change and the fight against international terrorism. Our Berlin correspondent, jenny Hill, is in Schloss Elmau. The mountain setting may be idyllic, but the items offen the agenda are anything but. Today, the G7 leaders werejoined by Presidents anything but. Today, the G7 leaders were joined by Presidents and werejoined by Presidents and Prime Ministers from a number of different countries. The aim, to hear their perspective on a number of international threats. Among them, of course, terrorism and global warming. Today, the world came to Bavaria and briefly the Group of Seven became the Group of 15. Liberia is here, so is Iraq and Tunisia. And here’s why - the Islamic State terror group has gained ground here in Syria and across the border in Iraq. Already at the summit, world leaders are pledging to re-enforce the fight against them. Some have described this as a summit of crisis. What to do about Russia or Greek debt. But as G7 President, this is Angela Merkel’s summit and Angela Merkel’s agenda. And she wants to do something about this. Her aim, to lower fossil fuel emissions and to increase a fund to help poor countries affected by climate change. You may see some concrete figures, some concrete targets for reducing emissions, again the important thing is they will set the agenda for discussions later in the year. The bodies legitimately tasked with this issue. Expect too some decisions about global health. The West was criticised for its reaction to the Ebola crisis. The leaders here are discussing plans for an international rapid response task force to deal with future pandemics. The setting maybe remote, but what is said here is likely to resonate worldwide. Well the summit will wrap up later this afternoon. That is when the leaders will release their final communique. It outlines what they have discussed, what they have decided and in which direction they would like to see global policy travelling. Thank you. Two men who were jailed for crimes they didn’t commit have lost a legal challenge against a refusal to pay them compensation. Victor Nealon spent 17 years in prison for attempted rape and Sam Hallam served seven years for murder. Daniel Sandford is at the High Court. Why haven’t they been allowed compensation? This focussed on a change in the law made under the coalition Government last year. It tightened up the rules on who qualified for compensation after a successful appeal against a criminal conviction. The new rules said compensation would only be given if new evidence came to light which proved beyond reasonable doubt that the person didn’t commit the crime. Well, today’s decision focussed on two cases. Victor Nealon was cleared after 17 years in jail forand two cases. Victor Nealon was cleared after 17 years injailforand Sam Hallam served seven years in prison for murder before winning his appeal. Although Nealon was cleared after DNA evidence came to light which suggested that somebody else, an unknown person may have committed theand also Sam Hallam was cleared, suggesting his alibi might have been accurate after all, the Ministry of justice decided that in neither case did the new evidence prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they didn’t chit the crime. Although both have been cleared, set free and both are innocentin been cleared, set free and both are innocent in the eyes of the law, compensation was not awarded. Today, the Lord justices decided that decision made by the then Secretary of State for justice, decision made by the then Secretary of State forjustice, Chris Grayling was a reasonable decision. Supporters of the two said this was a legally and morally wrong judgment, that today was a sad day for British justice judgment, that today was a sad day for Britishjustice and for British justice and the men were again having to prove they are innocent. Both will appeal. This argument over who qualifies for compensation after a miscarriage of justice will roll on for many years. Doctors who carry out cosmetic procedures should allow patients time to think about what they’re planning before going ahead with treatment. The General Medical Council says the rapid growth of the cosmetic industry means more vulnerable patients are at risk and they should be given a ‘cooling off’ period. Our correspondent, Sangita Myska, reports. The cosmetic surgery industry is booming and worth around £3 billion in the UK alone. But every procedure carries risks. Five years ago, these women were among the 40,000 in Britain to have received breast implants made from industrial silicon. Regulations have since been tightened, and today’s proposed guidelines from the General Medical Council are designed to strengthen safeguards for patients and raise standards among doctors. The vast majority of doctors who are involved in cosmetic interventions of one kind or another do a good job. I think what they want is for the ones who aren’t so good to stop doing it, or get the proper training and patients aren’t in a position where they are under unfortunate pressure. The proposals set out how doctors should behave, including offering patients a cooling-off period, to thoroughly think through decisions without making unjustifiable claims. The GMC says patients have to do their homework too, by researching the background of their chosen doctors, and not simply relying on reputations. That involves chasing up references, and making sure their chosen doctors are properly qualified. The GMC says it is keen to hear from members of the public about the proposed guidelines. From today you no longer need the paper part of the UK driving licence. The paper counterpart shows a driver’s record, including offences and endorsements but now all that information is going online instead. But some are concerned that it could mean car hire confusion for holidaymakers this summer. Emma Simpson reports. The holiday essentials, passport and driving licence. From today the paper bit is no longer valid. It is a big shift. Have you heard anything about these changes? Nothing. There’s not been much about it. We have heard all about it. Are you happy about that? Terrific. Wonderful. I am always losing my paper one. Iam happy Wonderful. I am always losing my paper one. I am happy about it. What are the changes? The paper counterpart which has information on penalty points and convictions has been scrapped from today. If you want to hire a car abroad you may need to produce a code from the DVLA website, so the company can check your driving record. The code is only active for 72 hours T old-style full paper licence is still valid. The DVLA says going paperless will save millions and cut red tape. The car hire industry claims these rules are being rushed through. Going digital makes a great deal of sense. Unfortunately, the new system that is being Implemented has been poorly communicated. Our rentalfirms have not been given enough chance to fully test and verify the system works for their customers. The DVLA says the industry has been given plenty of warning and motorists should not be concerned. For the most part people don’t ask for the counterpart abroad. I know some people have had experience of that. If you need to, then you can go online yourself, on your smartphone if you have one, or on your hotel Wi-Fi and get a code. Equally, if they need to, they can call DVLA There were some signs up at Heathrow this morning. Many drivers maybe delighted to go paperless this summer, but the question is, how many will be caught unawares when they reach the car hire desks? British theatre and actors have had a great night at the Tony’s in New York - the most prestigious theatre awards in America. Dame Helen Mirren took the best actress trophy for playing the Queen. And 26-year-old Alex Sharp - who went to New York after being rejected by British drama schools - won Best Actor for his performance in ‘The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time’ - which also scooped four more awards. Here’s David Silitto. In theatre, this is as big as it gets - the Tonys - the red carpet, the glamour and amongst it all young Alex Sharp. A few months ago, he was still at drama school and he was here because he had been nominated for what is his first professional role. I am unbelievably lucky. Unbelievably lucky. Any father, Christopher? Father and mother, but mother is dead. He plays Christopher a boy with Asperger’s syndrome - he has a brilliant mind for maths and puzzles, but the puzzle that leaves him stumped is other people. The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time has been a successful book and a multi-award winning play in London and now New York. And the American Theatre Wings Tony goes to Alex Sharp for The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time. Ijust want to dedicate this to any young person out there who feels misunderstood or who feels different and answer that question at the ends of the play for you. Does that mean I can do anything? Yes, it does. Thank you so, so much. A few minutes later, the word being used again and again was ""unbelievable."" Rejected by drama schools in Britain, Alex had grown up in Devon, ended up in America and the prestigiousjulliard. He was still studying when he went for the audition. To be given a part like this, as a young actor, is extraordinary. It was a brilliant night for British theatre. Helen Mirren winning for The Audience. Awards too for Sky Light and Wolf Hall, but a Tony for a debut performance, it is a night Alex Sharp certainly won’t forget. Time for a look at the weather. Well, all quiet so far this week. It has been a beautiful start with a lot of sunshine. In York, a lovely morning. More in the way of fair weather cloud here. West is best for the sunshine. You are closer to high pressure. Circulating around that high is a north-easterly breeze. Here we could see a few isolated showers through the afternoon. If you catch a shower, you will know about them - you catch a shower, you will know about them - they are fairly heavy, but nevertheless, as I say, well isolated. Certainly the further west you keep the best of the sunshine and the warmth. A risk of isolated showers to the north of London. Along the south coast highs of 21 Celsius. That is 70 Fahrenheit. Decent spells of sunshine across much of Wales. A risk of a few showers into the Midlands, up through the Pennines. Along the North Sea coasts more subdued, only about 11 Celsius. 14-15 Celsius. Dry and sunny through the afternoon. Some of the showers filter further west during the night. Under clearer skies temperatures will fall away sharply. just a degree or so above freezing in many rural places. The exception the far north of Scotland and the far south-east corner. I would not be surprised if we see a touch of grass frost first thing. Another beautiful day in prospect in terms of sunshine. The breeze will be stronger across that south-east corner, running in pretty cold seas. That will make it disappointing on east posed east coasts. We do it all again on Wednesday. The winds ease offjust a touch, that is 68 Fahrenheit and a good deal of weather on offer on Thursday. We will start to see the potential for some thundery breakdowns to develop over the south-west. There is some heavy thunderstorms likely. This area of low pressure may drift steadily north through Thursday night into Friday. There is a great deal of uncertainty as to the extent of that low, the position of where it will sit and how much rain we could see from it. If you have outdoor plans from Friday onwards, keep watching the weather forecast. For the early half of this week it is plain sailing. That is it. Back to you. Thank you. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: Alton Towers theme park has reopened after the rollercoaster crash. One victim’s family reveals she’s had to have her leg amputated. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London News - I’m Victoria Hollins. Scotland Yard has confirmed it’s investigating 16 allegations of electoral malpractice in connection with this Thursday’s mayoral election in Tower Hamlets. The election was called after the former Mayor Lutfur Rahman was found guilty of electoral fraud and removed from office. BBC London’s political correspondent, Karl Mercer has been following the story. What more do we know about the allegations? It seems extraordinary, I’m standing here yet againjust It seems extraordinary, I’m standing here yet again just three days away from an election in Tower Hamlets and once again we are talking about allegations about the way the election is being conducted. As you say, we understand that 16 complaints have been made to the Tower Hamlets returning officer, the man in charge of the elections and they have been passed on to be Metropolitan Police. Not all of those concerned electoral fraud, Metropolitan Police. Not all of those concerned electoralfraud, we are told. Some of those are about the candidates as well. It is extraordinary because this election is only being held because the last election in May last year was ruled void by the High Court after allegations of election fraud. You would have thought this time around all of the parties and all of the candidate would have tried to be above board but yet again we have allegations and counter allegations in Tower Hamlets. There has been more information about last year’s election. Yes, this is interesting. Scotland Yard have apparently written to Tower Hamlets’s Council and asked them to keep hold of all of the documents concerning the European, Merrill and local council elections held last May for a further six months, the ballot papers, the expenses put in. -- mayoral elections. They have asked them to keep hold of them for another six months. That looks forward to whether the Met and the Scotland Yard will look into criminal allegations and possible criminal prosecutions that could follow the High Court ruling. Thank you. A Christian nursery worker who was sacked from herjob in West London for telling a lesbian colleague that homosexuality is a sin has won a discrimination claim against her employer. Sarah Mbuyi was dismissed from Newpark Childcare Nursery in Shepherd’s Bush for gross misconduct in 2013. I think that when somebody approaches you and asks you a question and you answer it that’s not harassment. Besides, I never displayed any sort of anti-gay behaviour towards her, of anti-gay behaviour towards her. Ealing is one of the most religiously diverse parts of London so perhaps it’s not surprising that plans to scrap parking permits for places of worship has not gone down particularly well with those affected. The council says it’s following the example of other local authorities. But religious groups are urging Ealing to reconsider. Gareth Furby has the story. Inside the Buddhist temple in Chiswick - home to the monks and the oldest such monastery in the UK. But for the past few weeks the sense of peace has been disturbed. Because there are no parking spaces, no parking permits, we have to work to get a solution for this serious problem. He’s talking about this. Religious parking permits which did cost £30 a year. The temple had 15, used by visitors and people delivering food to the monks. But next month they are being withdrawn. It’s still a place of peace but we feel we’ve been treated badly by Ealing Council. We can now look and see how much it actually costs to park here. Is £1.40 for an hour and up to £4.20 for up to three hours. Ealing Council stresses there are no restrictions at the weekend, and there is a tube station nearby. But in Southall a Hindu temple is losing up to 25 passes which had been used by visitors to park on this street out the back. I think they are actually depriving people to come and visit our ",,

And the latest figures revealing the full extent of dog attacks in the capital. Good evening and welcome to the BBC news at six. The thousand migrants rescued by the British naval warship HMS Bulwark this weekend have begun to disembark in the Sicilian port of Catania. They were rescued off the coast of Libya. It’s understood at least ten of the women on board are pregnant. The ship is part of an international effort to try to prevent the hundreds of deaths in the Mediterranean so far this year as desperate migrants drown as they try to reach Europe. So far this year 99,000 migrants have arrived by boat from countries in Africa and the Middle East. 53,000 have arrived in Italy alone. In Catania this evening, the latest arrivals are being processed by the authorities. Clive Myrie is on the dock there. Clive, how long is it expected to take to get all the migrants from HMS Bulwark ashore? It will take some time, several hours. 1000 people need to disembark and some of them are in a fragile state, tired and exhausted, some of them traumatised and several are pregnant. It will take well into the night before they all leave HMS Bulwark. The port is one of several dotted along the coast that has taken them in and the British navy ship over the past weeks has rescued 2700 people from the Mediterranean. Our defence correspondent has been on board. From the fear of losing their lives at sea, to the rescue by the Royal Navy and then to the safety of a British warship. This morning, the 1200 migrants on HMS Bulwark put their nightmare journey behind them, with the hope of a fresh start. With so many saved, some had to spend the night in the open. Felix and Henry travel to Libya from Nigeria to make the perilous crossing and were already dreaming of their new life in Europe. So many dreams, in particular, I know when I get to Europe, probably I will get a chance. I want to go to England, but anywhere they take me too in Europe, I know I will be fine. The Europeans are careful. Soon HMS Bulwark. In Sicily but for many theirjourney will not end there. Italy will give them refuge for the time being but many want to move on to other European countries. Tonight, HMS Bulwark started to disembark live she saved, a trickle that would become a steady stream. First, those who needed medical attention, including pregnant women. Five men among the rescued were going to be taken away by police for questioning about possible links to smuggling gangs behind this grim trade. They are sending women, children, the old and young, pregnant, out onto a perilous journey in unseaworthy vessels across a vast tract of ocean. They are committing acts tantamount to murder. We ought to do our best to try to deal with them. But there is as yet no plan to tackle the root cause. So far, this is simply a mission to save lives. For these children, there is at least hope for a better future. And there will be many more in Libya willing to take the same risks. Once the migrants arrive in Italy, they are taken to a reception and holding centre, all over the country. It could be several years before they get paperwork that means they are legally allowed to stay in this country, which means for a considerable amount of time they can not be employed. This is some of the most fertile land in Italy. Sicilian olives and oranges among the world’s finest, but the neat rows of crops are not so attractive the closer you get. Working in some of the fields are migrants who escaped poverty and war, only to end up as cheap exploited labour. We film out of sight of the gangmasters who control them. We enterthe sight of the gangmasters who control them. We enter the splendidly named hotel Sudan, home to refugees from the recent fighting there, but 5-star it certainly is not. It is not much, look at it. It is frankly a dump. Some of the produce they have been taking out, some of the potatoes, which they get paid little for, sometimes not paid at all. It is a real mess. This is what the migrants have crossed the Mediterranean for, risked their lives for. It is hardly the promised land. Salamon escaped to Italy six years ago and said for a backbreaking ten hour shift picking vegetables, he is lucky to get 30 euros, £22. It is the only work I can get in Italy, he says. This is about exploiting us. Working in the fields is such a hard job. He then showed me his home. This is nothing. You have a stove, food in the background and bare earth. Will life get better for you? You do not think it will change? Life will not change? Rights activists say the Mafia is often linked to exploitation of migrants and police and officials are reluctant to intervene. Gangmasters therefore act with impunity. As I say goodbye, another Manco ‘s me over, he is angry, saying we should not film. He says if the Mafia caught us, they would slit our throats. It will be night time before those on-board HMS Bulwark are disembarked and end up in the holding centres awaiting them. Once the ship takes on board supplies, it will head back out to the middle of the Mediterranean. Hopefully to save more lives. The often troubled relationship between the Conservative Party and Europe is back centre stage after the Prime Minister today tried to clarify what his ministers can or cannot say concerning the upcoming EU referendum. It’s been widely reported that any member of his government who did not back his position would be expected to resign. But this afternoon David Cameron, at the G7 summit in Germany, said his remarks had been misinterpreted. Our political editor Nick Robinson reports from Westminster. just as David Cameron is trying to make friends in Europe, he is losing them at home. Soon after the Prime Minister waved goodbye to world leaders in Germany, he faced an angry row about his plan for a referendum on the EU. This morning’s headlines were clear and unanimous, ministers who want Britain to get out of the EU would have to quit, or be sacked first. Today the Prime Minister insisted he had not said that. He had just been demanding support for his efforts to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Europe. Ifeel there was renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Europe. I feel there was a misinterpretation which is why I wake up and read the papers and thought I would repeat what I said and make that clear. What was he saying? He chose his words very, very carefully. Repeatedly looking down to read from his notes. It would be wrong to answer hypothetical questions, and I know thatis hypothetical questions, and I know that is frustrating, you want to iump that is frustrating, you want to jump to the end of the process and have all the questions answered now, that will not be possible. We will take its step-by-step and you will get the answers. journalists who wrote their stories after a briefing by the Prime Minister himself would not convinced, and did not like being told they got it wrong. The view I want to get to is a successful renegotiation, being able to recommend Britain should stay in the EU. In that case, the government will not be a bystander but will have a clear view. It is notjust noisy Tory backbenchers who are worried, some in the Cabinet, who are silent, remain concerned. They want freedom to argue forbidden to leave the EU. There is no argument for trying to apply collective responsibility when they face with the decision to be or out of Europe will stop it is the future of the country. Otherwise you will get decent, intelligent people being forced to resign. If you wonder what the fuss is about, this is a debate about Britain’s place in the world. It is about a vote no one has had a chance to cast for more than four decades. It is not about geography and politics, it is about history as well. Ever since Ted Heath signed Britain up to the European club, there has been a row about whether people knew what they were joining. A greater united Europe. It was Labour’s Harold Wilson who Ao years ago gave people a vote on whether to stay in. He allowed ministers in his cabinet to show their deep divisions on prime-time television. Will you allow me to answer the question. Years after Labour spit on the issue, so too did the Tories. First under Margaret Thatcher, and then john Major. Like me or loathe me, do not bind my hands when I am negotiating on behalf of Britain. The Chancellor back then said there was no reason to think it would be different now. On the question of whether we will settle it once and for all, whether we will settle it once and forall, it for all, it will settle it for a while. I would for all, it will settle it for a while. Iwould not while. I would not bet the house on settling it for ever. I think these arguments will probably continue. David Cameron believes history will not necessarily written peat itself and he might be right. But he feels that because he knows the issue of Britain’s relationship with the rest of the continent has notjust spit his party, but others as well. The family of a 17-year-old girl have revealed she’s had her left leg amputated after being seriously hurt in the roller coaster crash at Alton Towers. Leah Washington was in the front row of the Smiler ride when it collided with an empty carriage. Her relatives say she now faces many months of rehabilitation and have thanked medical staff for saving her life. The news came as the theme park reopened, six days after the crash. jon Kay is at Alton Towers. Alton Towers issued a statement in the past few minutes saying they deeply saddened by the news of Leah Washington. They say they hand-delivered letters to all those injured in the roller-coaster crash, accepting full responsibility and promising compensation claims would be dealt with swiftly and sensitively. And yes, the new she lost a leg, had it amputated, came as the park reopened the first crowds came through turnstiles. 10am and they were queueing to get back into Alton Towers. The first visitors since the roller-coaster crash last week. It is probably the safest time to come because they will have checked everything thoroughly. The chances of it happening are slim. It is quite quiet. I expected more people as it opened today. just a bit nervous. It soon looked and sounded like business as usual. Thrill seekers again boarding rides like Nemesis, close to the scene of Tuesday’s accident. But here, in the middle of the theme park, it is very quiet indeed. This is where the smiler is, this is where the accident happened. This is a zone that has been cordoned off. The security staff caught in this oft to stop the public going in. Health and safety investigators have been on site since the crash happened. We know the passengers -- site since the crash happened. We know the passengers -- one of the passengers on the front row of the roller-coaster hat to have a limb amputated. The family of Leah Washington said she lost her left leg as well as having a fractured hand and faces months of rehabilitation. Three other passengers on this same carriage also remain in hospital. Merlin Entertainments, who run Alton Towers, have written to the passengers, accepting responsibility and promising compensation. They have closed rides at other parks the safety checks. It is inevitable there will be a degree of trust lost. What they have managed to do is get across the fact they have taken the incident seriously and shown proper concern for the impact on the victims. Those who turned up today did not seem any more nervous than usual. Any reservations? No, it is quiet, we are getting on the rides really quick. It is safe enough. What happened was a freak accident. On a Monday injune, it is hard tojudge the effect accident. On a Monday injune, it is hard to judge the effect of the crash on visitor numbers. The full impact will not be clear until later this summer. Our top story this evening: The thousand migrants rescued by the British navy warship HMS Bulwark off the coast of Libya are finally brought ashore. Towards the The BBC can reveal that the former Fifa vice president, jack Warner has been investigated by US prosecutors over the disappearance of money meant for victims of the Haiti earthquake. He visited the country in 2010 and raised $750,000 from Fifa and the Korean Football Association to help rebuild the country after the disaster. Mr Warner is facing extradition from Trinidad and Tobago to stand trial in the US on allegations of corruption and bribery. He denies all the charges. There’s some flash photography in Ed Thomas’ report from Trinidad. It was an earthquake that devastated Haiti. Killing thousands of people. jack Warner, one of football’s most powerful men, promised help. Fifa money to rebuild lives in a place he had visited before. I left a country with a sense of hope. For the first time, we can reveal that US prosecutors have investigated what jack Warner did with that aid money. These papers contain allegations of wire fraud totalling $750,000. Emergency aid money, sent from Fifa and the Korean FA, for victims of the earthquake. But investigators have claimed it was transferred to accounts controlled byjack Warner, at his direction, for his personal use. And four years on, the money is still unaccounted for. jack Warner was the most powerful man in the Caribbean. This man worked alongside jack Warner for five years. Worried for his safety, he has asked to remain anonymous and claims that his former boss was free to do what he wanted. Given his power in Trinidad, he would get transactions done that a regular person would not. Folks with money can get anything done. jack Warner is wanted in the US for charges of corruption and money-laundering, a former FIFA vice president at the centre of a bribery scandal. A source close to the investigation has told the BBC that they are working through 75 bank accounts connected to jack Warner, but admit that some of Fifa’s missing millions may never be found. Tonight, authorities here in Trinidad promised to find the aid money. I think ifjack Warner actually stole money that was meant for Haiti, it is a despicable crime. And I would expect the authorities to do all that they can to ensure the recovery of that money. Criminally investigate the trail? Absolutely. They would have my full backing. jack Warner has never faced prosecution for the Haiti Emergency Fund. Money from Fifa and the Korean FA. Could Fifa have stopped all of this? Of course. At any point in time. Fifa later sent more than $3 million to help rebuild football in Haiti. jack Warner denies all the allegations against him and says that he is a victim of a conspiracy. President Obama has issued his strongest warning yet to President Putin, accusing the Russian president of a wrongheaded desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire in the conflict in Ukraine. Speaking at the G7 Summit in Germany, the US president warned there would be additional sanctions against Russia if necessary. Our Diplomatic Correspondent james Robbins is at the summit in Bavaria. james Comey Barack Obama, certainly not holding back in expressing his frustration. -- not holding back in expressing his frustration. -- james, Barack Obama. Strong language, emboldened by the fact that he got a clear commitment from the G-7 leaders to get behind the European Union and ensure that it goes on rolling over sanctions against Russia unless President Putin changes course, threatening even greater sanctions if he worsens the situation in their view. President Obama made it clear that the Russian economy is suffering and President Putin has to make a fundamental choice now. He has to make a decision, does he continue to wreck his country’s economy, and continue Russia’s isolation in pursuit of a wrong-headed desire to recreate the glory of the Soviet empire, or does he recognise that Russia’s greatness does not depend on violating the territorial sovereignty of other countries? Briefly, one other headline from the summit, the leaders here have set a date for what they regard as the end point for the burning of all fossilfuels. At the end of the century. They say by then it is vital that we have moved entirely away from burning oil and gas. It may sound ludicrously ambitious, and frankly unattainable, but they believe that it is a signal of intent and design to make greater the prospect for the settlement of climate change issues at the Paris summit later this year. james, thank you. MPs have clashed over plans to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament. The Scotland Bill would give Holyrood more control over income tax and welfare. But Scottish National Party MPs said this afternoon the Bill doesn’t honour promises made during the referendum campaign. Our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale reports. In the heat of last year’s referendum campaign, the people of Scotland were promised a new powers for their parliament. If they voted not yes but now to independence. A so-called vow that David Cameron and other UK party leaders promised to honour in full. Today, the government set out new laws that it claims fulfilled that promise, creating what it says is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world. This bill demonstrates the government’s determination that the Scottish Parliament should be made more powerful and accountable yet autonomous and better equipped to serve the people of Scotland. The bill would give the Holyrood parliament the power to set income tax rates and bands in Scotland and retain the money raised. It would also get to keep VAT revenues and have new responsibilities over some benefits. But the SNP says that the bill does not go far enough. We stood on a mandate of powers for a purpose. Why did we not deliver what the people of Scotland voted for? Full economic powers. The SNP wants Scotland is to have more powers over welfare, business tax and the minimum wage. Here at Gretna Green inside the Scottish border, some agree. The majority of people would like to see more independence rather than being dictated from Westminster. At the moment we get tremendous subsidies from across the border and yet going forward, is going to be less money within our local economies? A short steps out from Gretna Green, just a miles as the crow flies, some in England think the SNP are pushing their luck. I think they are trying to take over too much too soon. They have not shown that they can deal with what they are already asking for. I think there is an element of resentment towards the fact that Scotland is getting its own powers and everything else. But they are powers that the Scottish Government is determined to use. Today, the Finance Minister came to the Treasury to begin talks over what he ultimately will get to tax and spend. This is the start of a long Parliamentary battle but the SNP will keep pushing for more power and head of the Scottish parliamentary elections next year. The Conservatives have a majority in that building. Ministers say they will only accept what they call sensible changes. So once again, the relationship between Scotland and the rest of the UK is changing. The question, as always, is how much more change may be to come. In football, it’s England’s final day of training before kicking off their Women’s World Cup campaign in Canada. Tomorrow they face France - the nation that knocked them out of the Euros two years ago. The month-long tournament began on Saturday and is expected to be watched by more than a billion people worldwide. Katie Gornall is with the England team in Moncton in South-East Canada. It is the Canadian city that you have probably never heard of but it is where England intends to make a name for themselves at this World Cup. Life in Moncton has a certain pace. England arrived on Friday from Toronto. Fewer attractions and distractions may help them focus on a tough match against France. I believe we have a genuine chance to win this tournament. By no means are we favourites. We are playing a team considered the team who should be expected to win the tournament. But we are a team, at our best, food to the floor, maximum concentration, that can beat anyone. But beating France has so far proved beyond England. It was the friend who ended their last World Cup, equalising late and coming through a penalty shoot out. More recently, the players have lost friendlies to the USA, Germany and Canada, prompting concerns that they may struggle to go far in the tournament. First, they have two address painful memories. Ifelt that they have two address painful memories. I felt that we could hang on and get a win to see us through to the semifinals but it is a fine line in World Cup tournaments. I think the players that were involved and that will look to that experience and take that into the game on Tuesday. Moncton’s Stadium is the smallest venue in the World Cup with a capacity ofjust 15,000. But despite that, organisers have struggled to shift tickets. Some of the seats are available to students forjust £3. The local voices may be the loudest. In Canada, they share the language of the two competing countries so it is hard to know who will get the biggest cheer tomorrow and, more importantly, whetherthe last word will be French or English. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nina Ridge. We have had a bit of sunshine today with showers scattered around. Some of those affecting Scotland and eastern England. Moving further west, creeping through the Midlands. It will be mostly dry land clearing skies, quite chilly. A bit more of a breeze across northern Scotland and softening point. The small risk of a shower in northern Scotland. Through the central swathe of the UK we have clear skies and light winds. In the countryside, temperatures dropping close to freezing. But a bright start tomorrow morning with sunshine. The cloud will intend to -- the cloud will tend to increase. Most places dry and bright. Northern Scotland, more cloud, the odd light shower. Temperatures in Glasgow, 16 degrees. A high in Northern Ireland of 14 or 15. Always cooler on the east coast, where we have a breeze coming in from the North Sea. And still the breeze will affect southern counties. Heading west, picking up brighter, sunny spells. Highs of 15. Through the middle part of the week, high pressure affecting the UK, keeping things settled. You can see tight isobars to the north and south, around that high. Still quite breezy. Across northern Scotland, the greater risk of a scattering of showers through the afternoon. Predominantly fine and bright with sunshine. On Wednesday, warmer. Temperatures a degree or so higher. Forthe next warmer. Temperatures a degree or so higher. For the next couple of days, looking relatively settled. As we go to the end of the week, there is an increasing chance of us starting to pick up heavy rain as we move in from the south. At this stage, low confidence on the details so we will need to tie things down. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, On the programme tonight: An investigation is launched following new allegations of electoral malpractice ahead of this week’s mayoral contest in Tower Hamlets.

And not a paintbrush in sight - the exhibition celebrating 80 years of spray painting. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. Scotland Yard has confirmed it’s looking into 16 allegations of electoral malpractice in connection with this Thursday’s mayoral election in Tower Hamlets. The contest was called after the former mayor, Lutfur Rahman, was found guilty of electoral fraud and removed from office. Now the council has been ordered not to destroy the ballot papers from last year’s local elections as well. Our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer reports. There are just three days left of this in Tower Hamlets. For the second time injust over a year, people here are going to the polls to elect a mayor to run their borough. Someone to replace Lutfur Rahman, who was kicked out of office for corruptly winning the election last May. But even this time round, the polls are not allegation-free. We understand that 16 complaints have been made to the Tower Hamlets returning officer, the man in charge of the elections. Those have been passed on to the Metropolitan Police. Although 16, I think I have made six or seven allegations. -- Although 16, I think I have made six or seven allegations. -- of those 16. I want to make sure I am reaching as many people as possible. There is a lot of passion in politics in the East End. What we need to do in these next few days is to remind people that good behaviour is really important in our election, the democracy is a pretty sacred thing. The re-run of last year’s election was brought about when this man and three others challenged the result in the High Court. Today, he took more allegations about those elections last May to Scotland Yard. For their part, the police have asked Tower Hamlets Council to keep all documents from last May’s election for another six months. We are taking a whole set of additional evidence to the commission, and asking him to carry out a much more high-level and robust investigation. Lets just hope they actually look at it and do something this time. For too long, we have seen nothing ever happened. There is no public interest in condoning electoral fraud. Once again, then, an election in Tower Hamlets is under the spotlight. So are the authorities that have to make it run smoothly. We should know who Tower Hamlets’ next mayor will be on Friday morning. And here is a full list of candidates standing for mayor in Tower Hamlets. And there’s more on the election on our website.

A British naval ship has arrived in the Italian port of Catania carrying more than 1,000 migrants rescued from the Mediterranean over the weekend. The migrants were the latest trying to make their way from North Africa to Italy. So far this year, some 99,000 migrants have arrived in Europe by sea. They’ve come from countries in Africa and the Middle East. More than a half- some 53,000 have made their way to Italy. Tonight, we have two reports on the migrant crisis.

This follows a ramping up of patrols in recent weeks, after Italy scaled back operations last year due to cost. One vessel tried to if ill the 9aPÂ cost. One vessel tried to if ill the gap, a specially converted fishing trawler. Over the past week, gap, a specially converted fishing trawler. Overthe past week, our correspondent was given exclusive access to the ship as it mounted one of the biggest rescue operations in recent years. It is mid-morning when they catch sight of the first boat. It is a wooden vessel designed to carry around a dozen fishermen. There are 560 migrants on board. Half crammed below deck, out of sight. I think what we are doing is we are deliberately approaching boat, not from the side, but from behind. That is to stop everyone from rushing over to one side and potentially capsizing it. The boat is so overpacked that one false movement could capsize it. Sit down! Most of these people are from Eritrea, many cannot swim. The sodback ferries them back to the Phoenix. With hundreds aboard the operation takes hours. -- Zodiac. On the deck, the last remaining men are still waiting anxiously, amid the few abandoned belongings of those who have been rescued. How are you? OK? Tired and hungry? Below deck conditions were far worse. You can barely stand up. Infact deck conditions were far worse. You can barely stand up. In fact you cannot stand up. There were 250 people crammed down here. You can see there’s water coming into the boat here. And it is really boiling down here. You can imagine people here for hours on end, cramped up together- nowhere to go to the toilet. As the day wears on, more boats appear. By noon there are more than 2, 500 boats appear. By noon there are more than 2,500 people adrift around us. Help is on its way. Ships from various European navies are co-ordinating their efforts here at sea. Hi there. The migrants themselves though will all be taken back to Sicily. What happens to them then is a matter of heated political debate and a of huge uncertainty for those desperate to make Europe their home. HMS Bulwark, which you can see behind, took part in the recue this weekend, picking up over 1,000 migrants. The latest rescue brings the total number of people saved by HMS Bulwark to more than 2,700. Our defence correspondent, jonathan Beale, was aboard. Their journey Theirjourney behind them, this morning the 1200 migrants rescued by HMS Bulwark were looking forward to a fresh start. There were so many on board, they crowded the upper decks too. Among them, Felix and Henry, who travelled to Libya, now dreaming of their new lives in Europe. So many dreams. In particular, I know when I get to Europe, probably I will get a chance. I want to go to England. Anywhere they take me to in Europe, I know I will be fine. They are careful. First up were -- careful. First up were -- first off were those needing medical attention. Pregnant women. There were ten on board and the mothers with babies. The children, some on their own. The trickle turned into a stream. Hours after it docked and HMS Bulwark is still offloading its passengers. Britain helped to save the lives of these people, but this is where the UK Government believes its responsibilities end. They are now in the hands of the Italian authorities. Five of those rescued were led away by police to be questioned about possible links to the trafficking gangs behind this grim trade. Well, they are sending women, children, the old, the young, pregnant, out on to a very, very perilous journey, pregnant, out on to a very, very perilousjourney, in unsea pregnant, out on to a very, very perilous journey, in unsea worthy vessel, across the ocean. They are conducting actsant amount to murder. We ought to do our level best to try and deal with them. But as yet, Europe does not have a solution. There’ll be many more people making this same journey. Risking their lives in the hope of a better life than the one they left behind. Well, it whats be an long process taking the migrants off. It has taken zerl hours. Once on dry -- taking the migrants off. It has taken zerl hours. Once on dry -- it has taken several hours. Once on dry land they will be take on the the reception. It could be years before they get papers saying they can live freely in Italy. As for HMS Bulwark it will head out to sea on the lookout for Mr My grant boats. We will continue our coverage of this in the Mediterranean and how it is affecting northern Europe. For now, it is back to you in London. Thank you very much again. David Cameron has denied saying that ministers who refused to back him on Europe would be expected to resign. The Prime Minister said remarks he’d made yesterday had been misinterpreted. Mr Cameron said he’d been referring to ministerial responsibility during the period of negotiations with the EU, not the referendum campaign itself. Our political editor, Nick Robinson, has the story. just as David Cameron is trying to make friends in Europe, he’s losing them back at home. Soon after the Prime Minister waved a friendly goodbye to world leaders in Germany, he faced an angry row about his plan for a referendum on the EU. This morning’s headlines were clear and unanimous - ministers who want Britain to get out of the EU would have to quit or be sacked first. But today the Prime Minister insisted he had not been saying that at all, he had just been demanding support for his efforts to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Europe. I feel that there was a misinterpretation, which is why I woke up and read the newspapers and thought, well I will repeat what I said and make that very clear. He was, he said, merely demanding that ministers back his efforts to get a better deal in Europe, but what was he saying about the referendum? He chose his words very carefully, repeatedly looking down to read from his notes. I’ve always said what I want is an outcome for Britain that keeps us in a reformed EU, but I’ve also said we don’t know the outcome of these negotiations, which is why I’ve always said I rule nothing out. Therefore it would be wrong to answer hypothetical questions. journalists who wrote their stories after a briefing by the Prime Minister himself weren’t convinced, and didn’t much like being told they’d got it wrong. The view I want us to get to is a successful renegotiation, reform of the European Union, and being able to recommend that Britain should stay in the European Union. Of course in that case the Government is not going to be a bystander, the Government will have a very clear view. It’s notjust noisy Tory backbenchers who are worried, some in the Cabinet who have to remain silent are concerned too. They want complete freedom to argue for Britain to leave the EU. There is no argument whatsoever for trying to apply collective responsibility to people once they face the decision should we be inside or outside Europe. It is really as simple as that, it’s the future of the country. Otherwise you’re going to get honourable, decent, intelligent people being forced to resign. If you are wondering what all the fuss is about, this is a debate about Britain’s place in the world, it’s about a vote that no one has had the chance to cast for more than four decades. It’s notjust about geography or politics, it’s about history as well. Ever since Prime Minister Ted Heath signed Britain up to the European club, there’s been a row about whether people knew what they were actuallyjoining. ..A new and a greater united Europe... It was Labour’s Harold Wilson who Ao years ago gave people a vote on whether to stay in, and he allowed ministers in his own Cabinet to show their deep divisions on prime-time television. Will you please allow me to answer the question? If I may say so with respect, I don’t think it is reasonable. Years after Labour split on the issue, so too did the Tories. First under Margaret Thatcher, thenjohn Major. Like me or loathe me, don’t bind my hands when I am negotiating on behalf of the British nation. A Chancellor back then says there is no reason to think the Prime Minister can solve his party’s European headache. On the question of will this settle this once and for all, well, it will settle it for a while. I wouldn’t bet the house on this settling it for ever. I think these arguments will probably continue. David Cameron insists that history doesn’t need to repeat itself, and of course he may well be right, but Europe has long been a party-splitter and the relationship between Britain and the rest of the continent has been pretty tricky ever since those maps were produced. Nick Robinson, BBC News, Covent Garden. World leaders attending that G7 summit in Germany have agreed to phase out the use of fossil fuels by the end of the century. The pledge comes six months ahead of the UN Paris conference, where around 200 countries will try to reach agreement on limiting the rise in global temperatures and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said the results of parliamentary elections in his country mean no party will be able to form a government on its own. His AK party has lost its majority for the first time in 13 years and he’s looking for coalition partners. A party representing Turkey’s Kurdish minority scored big gains, winning 80 seats in the 550-seat parliament. If no deal can be struck, the country may have to hold new elections. Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire has re-opened for the first time since the rollercoaster crash last week. Four people were seriously injured and doctors treating one of the victims, 17-year-old Leah Washington, revealed today that she’s had her left leg amputated above the knee. Our correspondent jon Kay reports from the park. Ten o’clock this morning and they were queueing to get back into Alton Towers. The first visitors since the roller-coaster crash last week. It’s probably the safest time to come because they obviously will have had to have been around and checked everything very thoroughly. The chances of it happening are so slim. It’s just one of those things. It’s quite quiet, isn’t it? I was expecting more people being as it opened back up today, but no, just a bit nervous. It soon looked and sounded like business as usual. Thrill-seekers once again boarding rides like Nemesis, close to the scene of Tuesday’s accident. But here in the middle of the theme park, it’s very quiet indeed. This is the area where the Smiler roller-coaster is, this is where the accident happened last week. As you can see, this zone is called the X Sector zone of Alton Towers. It has been cordoned off. There’s security staff all around here to stop the public going in. Health and safety investigators have been on site since the crash. It has emerged that one of the passengers on the front row has had to have a limb amputated. 17-year-old Leah Washington has lost her left leg, and now faces many months of rehabilitation. Three other young passengers also remain in hospital, as well as a woman in her 40s. Merlin Entertainments, who run Alton Towers, revealed tonight that they have written to all the injured passengers accepting full responsibility and promising swift compensation. Experts say, as well as reopening the park, the company needs to rebuild its reputation. I think it is inevitable that there will be a degree of trust lost. I think what they’ve also managed to do, however, is to get across the fact that they’ve taken the incident seriously and that they’ve shown proper concern for the impact on the victims at the same time. The Smiler will stay closed while investigations continue. Visitor numbers to the rest of the park seemed modest today. The full impact on business won’t be clear for a while. President Obama says the US does not yet have a ‘complete strategy’ for helping Iraq regain territory from so-called Islamic State. He was speaking at the G7 summit in Germany. In the 12 months since IS captured Iraq’s second city Mosul onjune 9th last year, they’ve gained control of about a third of the country. The BBC has obtained exclusive material filmed by local activists which provides a rare glimpse of life under IS control. Our correspondent Orla Guerin reports from the Kurdish region in northern Iraq. Heading to the front line near Mosul, escorted by Kurdish peshmerga fighters. Among them, Rashid, driven from the city himself when Islamic State advanced. Soon the enemy was in sight. The commander shows us IS positions. They are hidden in this tile factory and respond to our arrival. The forces here are looking out carefully now. Within the last few minutes, two mortars have been fired not far away. Islamic State fighters arejust up ahead. The distance is about 800 metres or half a mile, and they are firing in this direction every day. Further along the front line, on Zartek Mountain, a chance to see Mosul. 12 months on, Iraq’s second largest city and the surrounding areas, still held by the extremists in a death grip. And here, a rare look inside Mosul. This footage obtained by the BBC shows how Islamic State rule through terror and destruction. A Shia mosque is razed to the ground. Local activists risked their lives to capture IS handiwork and smuggle the pictures out. This 14th century mosque and shrine now in ruins, the militants denying the past as well as the future. In the shops, even the mannequins are veiled and women must be covered from head to toe. Christian homes seized and blocked up, branded property of Islamic State. The insurgents hide amongst civilians, taking cover under this bridge to fire an anti-aircraft gun. And they stash their tanks and heavy weapons out of view, safe from coalition air strikes. This official managed to flee Mosul in February. He had been sentenced to death. He shows me a photo of his brother, a businessman killed by the extremists, and says he witnessed scores of public executions. TRANSLATION: With my own eyes betweenjune 10th and February 2nd, I saw about 11+0 to 150 people being killed. They accused innocent people of adultery and stoned them to death. They push some off a high building for homosexuality. Others they hang. Back near the front line, a new volunteer force. Local men, eager to face down the insurgents. Sunnis, Shias and Kurds in step, but they have barely enough weapons for training, let alone for liberating Mosul. The BBC can reveal that the former Fifa vice-president, jack Warner, has been investigated by US prosecutors over the disappearance of money which was meant for victims of the earthquake in Haiti. Mr Warner visited the country in 2010 and raised $750,000 from Fifa and the Korean Football Association to help the recovery work. Mr Warner is facing extradition from Trinidad and Tobago to stand trial in the US on allegations of corruption and bribery. He denies all the charges. This report from Ed Thomas does contain some flash photography. It was an earthquake that devastated Haiti, killing thousands. And jack Warner, one of football’s most powerful men, promised Fifa money to rebuild. A man who only two years earlier had spoken of his love for the country. I left those guys with a sense of hope. I left a country with a sense But for the first time, we can reveal US prosecutors have investigated what jack Warner did with that aid money. These papers, seen by the BBC, contain allegations of wire fraud totalling $750,000. Emergency aid money sent from Fifa and the Korean FA for victims of the earthquake, but investigators have claimed it was transferred to accounts controlled by Warner at Warner’s direction for his personal use. Four years on, the money is still unaccounted for. jack Warner was the most powerful man in the Caribbean. This man worked alongside jack Warner for five years. Worried for his safety, he asked to remain anonymous. He claims his former boss was free to do what he wanted. Given Warner’s power in Trinidad, he would get transactions done that a regular person would not. jack Warner is wanted in the US on charges of corruption and money laundering. A former Fifa vice president at the centre of a bribery scandal. A source close to the US investigation has told the BBC they are working through 75 bank accounts connected to jack Warner, but admit some of Fifa’s missing millions may never be found. Tonight, authorities here in Trinidad promised to find the Haiti aid money. I think ifjack Warner actually stole money that was made for Haiti, it is the most despicable crime and I will expect the authorities to do all they can to ensure the recovery of that money. Criminally investigate the trail of that money? Absolutely. jack Warner has never faced prosecution for the Haiti emergency fund, money from Fifa and the Korean FA. Could Fifa have stopped all of this? Of course, at any point in time. Fifa later sent more than $3 million to Haiti. jack Warner denies all the allegations, and says he is a victim of a conspiracy. Oscar Pistorius, who’s in prison for shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, could be released on parole as early as August 21st. He will have served 10 months of his five-year sentence. South African authorities confirmed to the BBC that the release was due to the athlete’s good behaviour. Ms Steenkamp’s family have released a statement expressing their anger at the decision. The third-biggest contingent in the new House of Commons, the 56 MPs of the Scottish National Party, have been voicing their concerns about the content of the Scotland Bill, one of the first pieces of legislation brought forward at Westminster after the general election. The bill follows the recommendations of the Smith Commission, which was set up after the referendum on independence. Our deputy political editor james Landale reports. In the heat of last year’s referendum campaign, the people of Scotland were promised new powers for their parliament if they voted not yes but no to independence, a so-called vow that David Cameron and other UK party leaders promised to honour in full. Today the Government set out new laws that it claims fulfils that promise, creating what it says is one of the most powerful devolved parliament in the world. This bill demonstrates the Government’s determination that the Scottish Parliament should be made more powerful, more accountable yet autonomous, and better equipped to serve the people of Scotland. The bill would give the Holyrood parliament the power to set income tax rates and bands in Scotland and retain the money raised, it would also get to keep some VAT revenues and have new responsibilities over some benefits. But the SNP said the bill didn’t go far enough and called for new powers over welfare, business taxes, and the minimum wage. They promised home rule, and as close to federalism as possible. At least, I suppose, they have the nouse not to carve those particular promises on an eight-feet block of stone! Labour called for the Scottish Parliament to have even greater powers over welfare, and as for the SNP... It appears to me from the exchanges today, Mr Speaker, that the SNP are desperate to be disappointed before this bill has even started its passage through this House. But while SNP MPs in the Commons were complaining about the bill, across Whitehall their finance minister was arriving at the Treasury to begin talks about how to make the new powers work in practice. This isjust the start of a long Parliamentary battle, and the SNP will keep pushing for more power ahead of the Scottish Parliament elections next year. But the Conservatives have a majority in that building, and ministers say they will only accept what they call sensible changes. So, once again, the relationship between Scotland and the rest of the UK is changing. The question, as always, is how much more change there may be to come. After the iPhone, the iTune and the iPad, the computer giant Apple has nowjoined the competitive world of music streaming. But with a massive potential customer base dwarfing that of its rivals, does Apple’s entry signal the end of the digital download and the end of physical ownership of music? Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-jones investigates. When you are the world’s most profitable company, humility doesn’t come easy and tonight’s big claim from Apple was that it was reinventing the way we experience music. Its new service combines a 2lI-hour global radio station, a new way for artists to talk to fans, and a streaming music offering for which users will pay a monthly fee. It was Steve jobs who first made Apple a big noise in music when his iTunes store got music to pay for downloads. Last year physical sales were overtaken by digital music for the first time. It is not about digital downloads any more, they are falling. The new big thing is streaming services where you don’t own the music and there Apple hasn’t beenin own the music and there Apple hasn’t been in the game until now. Spotify has led the way in streaming but the Swedish company now has the strongest possible competition. Spotify has 15 million subscribers, but Apple will be targeting the 800 million users of iTunes. Artists have grumbled how much they earn from streaming, Taylor Swift took her music off Spotify but music bosses say that must now change. It is ourjob to make sure these colossal corporations, like Amazon, Apple, YouTube, Spotify, a proper amount of revenue to the people who make the content because without them they don’t have a business model. Tonight’s other announcements, what was once just a computer firm now wants to be in every area of our lives. That’s it. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening from BBC London News. I’m Riz Lateef. Scotland Yard has confirmed it’s looking into new allegations of electoral malpractice in connection with this Thursday’s mayoral election in Tower Hamlets. The contest is being run again after the former Mayor, Lutfur Rahman, was found guilty of electoral fraud and removed from office. Our Political Correspondent, Karl Mercer, reports. Hello. I am your candidate for the Mayor of Tower Hamlets. There are just three days left of this in Tower Hamlets. For the second time injust over a year, people are going to the polls to elect a mayor to run their borough. Someone to replace Lutfur Rahman, who was kicked out of office for corruptly winning the election last May. Even this time around, the polls are not allegation-free. We understand that 16 complaints have been made to the Tower Hamlets returning officer, the man in charge of the elections. Those have been passed on to the Metropolitan Police. First of all, of those 16, I think I have made six or seven allegations in that respect. We do need to move on. We have an election. We have three days to go. I want to make sure I am reaching as many people as possible. It is always lively. There is a lot of politics in the East End. What we need to do in the next few days is remind people good behaviour is important in our election, that democracy is a pretty sacred thing. The rerun of last May’s election was brought about when this man and three others challenged the result in the High Court. Today, he took more allegations about those elections last May to Scotland Yard. We have found. .. For their part the police have asked Tower Hamlets Council to keep all documents from last May’s election for another six months. We are taking a whole set of evidence to the commissioner and asking him to carry out a much more high-level and robust investigation. Let’s just hope they do something about it this time. For too long we have just seen them look at things and nothing everything happens. There’s no public interest in condoning electoral fraud. Once again, an election in tower Hamlets is under the spotlight, so are the authorities that have to make it run smoothly. We should know who Tower Hamlet’s mayor is next Thursday morning. And here is the full list of candidates standing for Mayor in Tower Hamlets. And you can find more details on the election on our website. A motorcyclist has died following a collision with a truck in Streatham early this evening. Officers were called to Streatham High Street junction with Beckmead Road just after 5:00pm this evening. The male motorcyclist suffered fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. A patient who was left in a vegetative state after his breathing tube became dislodged in hospital has been awarded £175,000 in damages. Raphael Smith was 17 when he was transferred to The Royal London Hospital after being shot in the neck. While there, he suffered major brain damage when his tracheostomy was displaced. New figures reveal, for the first time, the full scale of dog attacks in the capital. A change in the law means that attacks carried out on private property are now included in the data. ",,

Last year, around 1,400 offences were recorded in London - a 50% increase on the previous year. A Christian nursery worker has won a tribunal case after being sacked for her views on homosexuality. Sarah Mbuyi was dismissed for telling a lesbian colleague that God did not accept her lifestyle. An employment tribunal ruled she was discriminated against on the basis of her religious beliefs. Alice Bhandhukravi joins us now with more details. She is a born again Christian and she worked at a nursery in Shepherd’s Bush. There she had a lesbian colleague, who made it clear she was in a gay relationship. That colleague asked her what her views were on sexuality - colleague asked her what her views were on sexuality - homosexuality. New Miss Mbuyi told her God does not accept homosexuality and it is a sin. She was reported to management. Her bosses decided she should be dismissed. She spoke to me earlier and told me about why she decided to bring this case. I don’t really understand why answering a question with honesty, without being abru sieve, without being, you know, mean to the -- abusive, without being mean to the person, should be punished. This person was talking about her partner a lot and that’s... She defined it as the love of her life. In my case, jesus is the love of my life. I don’t see what is the difference. The tribunal ruled by dismissing her, her employers had discriminated against her because of oh her religious beliefs. She won -- because of her religious beliefs. She won her case. For its part, the nursery, her employers have issued a statement, saying we have robust policies to make sure our nursery is inclusive for our nursery and staff: So, they may well appeal. We may well not have heard the end of this case. OK, Alice, many thanks. An exhibition exploring the story of spray painting opens in London this week. It’s a style of work that was made easier with the invention of the spray can in 1949. It’s the first time that these works have been brought together in one place. The show at Gargosian Gallery includes pieces by Andy Warhol and London artist David Batchelor. My interest is in colour and spray paint is just one way of delivering colour on to a surface and it’s a very particular way. It doesn’t have any boundaries. It feels like an atmosphere. I think artists are always looking out for new ways, new materials, new technologies, new ways of delivering colour or paint or whatever to a surface. That’s it from me, so I’ll say goodnight. A very good evening to you. We start the week with lovely fine conditions. With that it is also fresh. It will turn more unsettled later on this week. Out there at the moment we have lost the cloud we had through this afternoon, bringing one or two showers. We have a clear sky through the night. That means it will be chilly again. I think five and six is not out of the question outside of London tonight. And then we start the day tomorrow with a smattering of cloud which could bring one or two showers. Most of the day will be dry, with sunny spells coming and going. A north-easterly breeze. Feeling cool. Outside of London, 14-15 Celsius. 17 Celsius inside London. Then we draw in warm and humid air on Thursday. It will come with some weather off the continent and low system pushing in heavy, thundery showers on Friday. An uncertain situation that. We will keep you posted. On the outlook, you can see there will be a rise in temperature through the week, but a greater possibility of seeing heavy thundery showers. We have some pretty settled weather. Clearing skies by night means some low temperatures. It will be pretty chilly. Tonight we will keep high pressure around, with lighter winds over central parts of the UK. That pattern continues into the middle part of the week. Around the edge of our high we have tightly packed isobars. More of a breeze across southern counties and Scotland. Across northern Scotland the chance of one or two showers. Most places will start at eight or nine Celsius. In the countryside we could see temperatures sitting around freezing, particularly over Northern Ireland. Although it is a chilly start tomorrow morning, we will see sunshine around. A small chance of showers moving through East Anglia and parts of Kent. Through the afternoon more overcast to northern Scotland and it brings with it the risk of a few light showers. Warmer over eastern Scotland at around 16 Celsius. We will see more cloud tomorrow on balance into the afternoon compared to today, across England and Wales. Still w that breeze coming in off the North Sea it will be cooler for eastern England. Furtherwest, temperatures England. Further west, temperatures tomorrow England. Furtherwest, temperatures tomorrow afternoon, 15-16. A very similar forecast for Wednesday. A chilly start to the day. Mainly dry and bright, with sunshine. Breezier to south-east England and across northern Scotland, where there could be one or two showers. Temperatures will be creeping up - a touch warmer on Wednesday, with many places reaching 17-18 Celsius. We could reach 20 Celsius across south-east England. That will continue on Thursday. By then we are starting to see some slow changes, with potential of patchy rain to northern Scotland. Perhaps this low pressure will be of more significance. Always a tricky one to forecast. Sitcomly kated. A-- it is complicated. We have warm and humid air being drawn UP have warm and humid air being drawn up laterthis have warm and humid air being drawn up later this week, particularly across parts of England and Wales. Temperatures will be rising, but we will pick up the chance of seeing heavy rain, moving northwards later on Friday, with that high pressure holding on further north it should stay dry here, with temperatures around 14 Celsius. This programme contains some strong language. APPLAUSE Good evening. Welcome to Have I Got News For You. I’mjack Dee. In the news this week...

Later on BBC London: Determined to ""fight"" forjustice - the recently released convicted murderer seeking to quash his conviction at the court of appeal. And, ditching their wheels to demand a living wage - London’s cycle Good afternoon, and welcome to the BBC News At One. HSBC says it’s cutting 8,000 jobs in the UK, as part of its strategy to reduce costs and simplify the business. It’s also going to scrap the HSBC brand on the high street, though it hasn’t yet decided on a new name. The bank, Europe’s biggest, says it needs to save more than £3 billion in costs within two years. Here’s our business correspondent, Emma Simpson. Britain’s biggest bank, a global giant, but HSBC is getting smaller, cutting billions of pounds of costs, and that means huge job losses. It is axing up to 25,000 posts around the world. 8000 of them will be in the UK. That is around one in six of the workforce. They have been through so much change in HSBC, so many people have already left theirjobs. Our members are already working very hard, since the financial crisis, and to find out today so many will lose their jobsis out today so many will lose their jobs is a kick in the teeth. It is unclear how many of these job losses will fall here at the high street banks or at -- will fall here at the high street banks or at -- if branches will close. It says, by becoming more efficient, it will not need as many people. Customers were wondering what it might mean forthem. Customers were wondering what it might mean for them. I am used to going six miles to the fact, if I have to do 16 miles, I might get upset. We have banked with these for such a long time, it is a nice bank. They are very good. Like other banks, HSBC is having to separate its retail side from its riskier investment banking operations. So, it says, to avoid using -- operations. So, it says, to avoid using-- confusing customers, high-street amateurs will get a new name -- high-street amateurs will get a new name -- branches. This is a bank with a presence across the globe. Today, it confirmed it is pulling out of Brazil and Turkey. Not quite as local as it used to be. It is a very tough environment for banks of any kind to make a lot of money at the moment. The regulators are hitting them with fines for misdemeanours, the regulators are requiring them to hold more capital, there is a massive technology change and interest rates are only 1%. HSBC makes loads of its money in Asia where it started its business 150 years ago. It is where it wants to focus on now. The question is, but it moved its London HO now. The question is, but it moved its London HQ here as well? It says it will decide by the end of the year. Let’s speak to our personal finance correspondent, Simon Gompertz. Customers are not sure what it means for them but we do know there are big changes ahead on the high Street. Seismic changes in banking and the branches are at the centre. Some of those customers we heard from doing a lot more on the Internet. And there is a lot of automation within banks. When you keep a branch open you might need fewer people to operate it. There are over 1000 HSBC branches but that has gone down by 130 in the past few years. They said today 12% of the branches in their seventh major rockets including the UK will be cut, over the next couple of years. Again, almost 130. How far might it go? TSB is making do with less than 700 branches. So you could see the other big banks going close to that and closures going a lot further. Such a well- known name but that name on the high-street will change, what could be? There has been a lot of speculation, it could be a new name. That is what Santander did replacing Abbey National. It is hard to bring a new name to consumers here. They could use one of their foremost consumers here. They could use one of theirforemost names, of their foremost names, first direct, a popular Internet and telephone brand. I am hearing that is less likely than reviving the old name of Midland bank which is what it took over, one of the biggest banks in the world. It is possible with the headquarters moving to Birmingham which is what they are going to do, they could revive the Midland name. MPs have begun debating legislation paving the way for a referendum on membership of the EU. David Cameron wants to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the EU, ahead of an in-out vote by the end of 2017. Here’s our political correspondent, Ben Wright. We will soon be asked to vote on a question, a big question. Should the UK remained a member of the EU? one answerwill be yes, UK remained a member of the EU? one answer will be yes, the other choice will be no. Today, Parliament began the process of putting that question and the rules of the referendum into law. The entire generation of British voters has been denied the chance to have a say on our relationship with the EU. Today, we are putting that right. We are having a referendum because the Tories won the election and promised a vote on EU them shipped by the end of 2017. Labour supports the policy but once the Government to include more people in the vote. We believe strongly our place should be in the EU. Because it is aboutjobs, growth, investment, our influence in the world. We will argue 17-year-olds should take part in this referendum because it is about their future. The SNP opposes an EU referendum and will try to change the bill to prevent Scotland being forced out of Europe if the UK boats to go. There are four countries making up the UK and each of those should have the vote and demonstrate a majority in favour of staying in the EU before we can reach a decision. There will be disagreement over how this boat should happen but with the Labour Party backing the Government the bill will go through, and the referendum will happen. A referendum that looks to pit Conservative MPs against each other in this battle for Britain’s future. There are different views within the Cabinet and David Cameron has not decided whether his ministers will be free to campaign against his position. Tory MPs are watching closely. When we get to the referendum, it would be wise to allow ministers to express their views. If the Prime Minister has done a deal to die for, they will want to support him. It is only the model in the middle which could cause problems. The referendum is two years away but this huge moment gets a step closer today. And Ben’s at Westminster. This is expected to go through, but there’ll no doubt be more division ahead. MPs are debating the mechanics of this referendum, the rules. One issueis this referendum, the rules. One issue is timing. We don’t have a date for this referendum, only that it has to be before 2017. The electoral commission says it should not take place at the same time as other elections. Another issue could be the wording of the question. Something of the commission wants to make sure it’s fair. MPs will have views on that. Tory MPs are worried the bill will allow public bodies to spend unlimited amounts on backing the Government case. That is causing concern. This is part of the Europe story dominating politics. The bigger question is the renegotiation David Cameron has promised to have with the EU over the next years. Philip Hammond has just said Britain will get a new settlement with Europe but is being quizzed by MPs on his own side what that settlement will look like, and at the end of the process, it will not be Parliament and MPs who decide what happened but voters who will determine whether Britain stays in the EU or Leeds. -- leaves. Three people are in custody in the West Midlands on suspicion of terrorism offences linked to Syria. Two men, aged 21 and 27, and a 21-year-old woman, were arrested this morning.

Police are investigating allegations that the former Labour peer Lord janner abused a boy while on a trip to Scotland in the 1970s.

More than 100,000 migrants have managed to cross by sea from North Africa to Europe since the beginning of this year alone. But many more are expected to attempt the perilous crossing in the next few months. The majority of people are landing in Italy, but there’s been a big increase in the numbers heading for Greece. Our correspondent, Paul Adams, reports on how Europe is coping with the influx. Another ship docks in Sicily this morning, 450 rescued migrants on board. The massive lobe reaching a new milestone. The UN says more than 100,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean this year. More than 54,000 have made it to Italy from West and East Africa. The largest single group are from Eritrea. 48,000 mostly Syrians and Afghans have arrived in Greece after crossing from Turkey. Aboard this Coast Guard vessel, tempers frayed. A migrant is dragged from a portable toilet and struck, a sign of the strain this huge operation is causing. British ships are heavily involved, nearly 200 migrants arrived on an Italian island on Sunday night, border patrol officers rescued them in two operations. Part of a total of 6000 rescued over the weekend. The Government says the operation is working. Since the naval force has working. Since the navalforce has been deployed into the Mediterranean, the number of migrants’s lives being lost at sea has declined close to zero which means the scale of the operation is for the moment adequate. With the new arrivals come a host of problems, not least the large numbers of children, many young and unaccompanied, been brought ashore. In Italy and Greece, they are so overwhelmed with numbers, they don’t have the money to have decent reception facilities. It is little wonder these children are making the decision to travel to northern Europe. The newest arrivals are on Italian soil, the latest phase of their dramaticjourney over. Plenty of help on the quayside but plenty of uncertainty about what happens next.

People in Wales could soon be banned from using e-cigarettes in enclosed public places like restaurants, pubs and at work. The new public health law would make Wales the first part of the UK to ban them. But the proposals, which would come into force in 2017, have divided opinion. Britain’s largest cancer charity says there’s no scientific evidence to support the policy, and it could actually undermine efforts to give up tobacco. Our Wales correspondent, Hywel Griffith, is in Cardiff. It is eight years since we saw the smoking ban introduced at pubs and bars, eight years since we saw the very first electronic cigarette on the market. In the meantime, their use has grown hugely and somebody is like Public Health England say they offer vast potential to help smokers quit. The Welsh Government take a different view, today it published details of a bank which will mean they will be cheated in the same way as Once it was smoke that hung in the air. Now in some pubs vapour has filled the gap. The rise of the e-cigarette has been rapid, especially amongst people trying to quit tobacco. The scientific community is split over whether these devices help or harm public health. But the Welsh government believes it needs to act. It will be no use at all in five or ten years’ time when the harm has actually happened to say we wish we had acted then. Because that harm will never be capable of being undone. The ban is based on the idea that e-cigarettes re-normalise smoking, the claim hotly disputed. We just don’t see what the evidence we’ve seen so far that you can justify the ban on those grounds in particular. There are potential unintended consequences, particularly that e-cigarettes are an opportunity for people to move away from tobacco smoking, which is very, very bad for their health and we wouldn’t put up any unnecessary barriers to prevent people from quitting cigarettes. Across the UK there is already two million people using e-cigarettes. Wales would be the only part of the country to prohibit their use indoors, but it’s not acting in isolation full stop In Belgium, similar restrictions already apply and in Brazil these things are banned completely. The ban would include the hundreds of shops that have started selling e-cigs. At this store in Cardiff opinion was divided. I think it’s good because not everyone smokes and it’s not fair on the people that do not smoke. Anything that helps people give up cigarettes is a positive. I think they should be able to smoke indoors and out. I don’t think they should be banned, do you know what I mean? It’s giving something else to replace the cigarette. The ban on sales to under 18 year-olds is on the way across the UK. But the Welsh government wants to go further and says it will not be blown off course. The Welsh government hopes it will get the ban passed before the next Welsh elections in May, and is amended in about 18 months. So by early 2017 we could see vapers hanging out with smokers outside pubs and bars. Well, our health editor, Hugh Pym, is with me. Credit spread to other parts of the UK? It seems there is little sign of that now -- could it spread. There were positions Ali provisions on marketing e-cigarettes but they stop short of banning their use in enclosed public spaces. In Northern Ireland there is no sign of a similar move and in England, Public Health England seemed well disposed to arguments for e-cigarettes. They are producing a report in a couple of months’ are producing a report in a couple of months’ time and in the past they have pointed to the benefits of helping smokers give up tobacco. That is the nature of devolution. Wales has decided to go down this route, as we have heard. The government’s bike and is better to be safe than sorry. In other words, legislate now to stop the use of e-cigarettes in enclosed public spaces and if more evidence appears in a few years time maybe you can loosen things up a bit. But as we have heard, cancer charities and some medical experts think this is a very bad move because it sends out the wrong signal to a smoker trying to give up, who has moved to e-cigarettes, that if you are putting them on a par with tobacco use in a pub or in a restaurant you may deter people from moving to e-cigarettes. There are some public health people, though, who agree with the Welsh government’s move, saying it could enter age teenagers of e-cigarettes use and could encourage them into tobacco. , guided arguments and a big issue for the UK as a whole. Here we have the first move down a certain route and it will be interesting to see what the evidence shows in a few years’ time. It’s thought that more than one billion cold calls are made in the UK every year. But it seems very few people who are bothered by them actually register their complaints. Now, the consumer rights group Which? is urging people to complain to the regulator Ofcom in a bid to crack down on cold callers and nuisance text messages. Tim Muffett reports. This phone plays a key role in Tracy Stabler’s life. When it rings it could be her hospital or her family, but often it’s someone trying to sell her things she doesn’t want. I’m blind. I’ve had five brain tumours, number six is growing back. What I find quite disturbing when you get the cold calls, when you actually tell the person who is making the cold call that you are not interested, they don’t take any notice. I think it upsets me and makes me feel more vulnerable than I already do feel. Your home should be your private space. Tracy and her partner Russ are ex-directory and registered with Ofcom’s Telephone preference service - the official opt-out list for those not wishing to receive unsolicited calls. But they’ve kept coming. They don’t realise what effect it has on the vulnerable. People are absolutely sick and tired of nuisance calls. Eight in ten of us are now getting them. That is a huge number of people. In the last six months over 60,000 people officially complained about nuisance calls and texts, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Actually, only 2% of people say they have made an official complaint so there are many millions more that are receiving these unwanted calls that aren’t complaining to the regulator. Marketing and sales calls can be legitimate. The key question is whether those making them have checked to see if the number is on the telephone preference service list. Ignore it and an organisation can be investigated by the Information Commissioner’s Office. In April the law was changed to make it easier to fine companies making nuisance calls and texts. Until then the Information Commissioner’s Office had to prove that the calls were causing substantial damage, or substantial distress. That legal requirement was removed. The law did change which removed one of the hoops we have to jump through in terms of proving a case against an organisation. We still need to build evidence. We need as much information as possible, and date of the call, the time of the call, what the person said, what it was about. Wherever they come from, whoever makes them, those bothered by nuisance calls are being urged to make their voices heard. Tim Muffett, BBC News.

A former deputy editor of the now defunct News of the World has gone on trial for plotting to hack phones. The jury was told that Neil Wallis ""knew"" of and ""agreed"" to the widespread use of phone hacking between 2003 and 2006. He denies the charges. Let’s speak to our correspondent, Richard Lister, who’s at the Old Bailey. Neil Wallis was a pillar of the tabloid establishment. He was an editor of the People newspaper before coming deputy editor of the News of the World in 2003 and a Andy Coulson. The prosecution say given Andy Coulson and a range of senior journalists at the News of the World have been convicted of phone hacking the prosecution say it is inconceivable that Mr Wallace did not know what was going on at the paper. He is not being accused of carrying out phone hacking himself -- Wallis. He’s accused of knowing about and agreeing to hacking by others at the paper and the prosecution told the jury today that it will hear evidence that he listened to a recording of an illegally intercepted voice mail and he also exchanged e-mails with journalists at the paper, which openly referred to phone hacking. The prosecution also says that Mr Wallis helped to recruit Dan Evans, and admitted phone hacking to the News of the World, and when they met at a bar Mr Wallis allegedly told Dan Evans: I know that you can screw phones but what else can you do? Dan Evansis phones but what else can you do? Dan Evans is one of the witnesses we expect to hear from Evans is one of the witnesses we expect to hearfrom in expect to hear from in this trial. It is due to last four weeks and Mr Wallis denies any connection to phone hacking and all the charges against him. Richard, thank you. Lenny Henry revealed he is to receive a knighthood in the Oueen’s birthday honours list.

It was found by two brothers on the south coast of Wales - and is thought to be a distant- and smaller- cousin of Tyrannosaurus Rex. Here’s our science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh. The dinosaurs are back. In the new film jurassic World. They roamed the planet for millions of years, all across the world, including here at lover knocked beach in the Vale of Glamorgan. We found that little claw at the end. Brothers Nick and Robert discover these remains last year, now on show at the National Museum Cardiff. We packed them in the back of my car and some guy said to me, found anything today? I said yes, I’ve got a dinosaur. It wasjust anything today? I said yes, I’ve got a dinosaur. It was just what type of dinosaur after that. After further analysis it looks like potentially the oldestjurassic analysis it looks like potentially the oldest jurassic dinosaur found in the world. The remains are beautifully preserved. The brothers discovered its arms, legs and jaws, and apparently it bit like a Rottweiler. So it had serrated teeth, a great mouthful of them and it was a hungry little animal. It would have eaten small early mammals, small reptiles, small lizards, anything it could get its hands on. This is what it might have looked like. It was around two metres long and lived 200 million years ago, around the time that most life on Earth became extinct. At the dinosaur survived, and went on to become the dominant species on the planet. -- but the dinosaur survived. It could potentially give some information about what the traits were that allowed the dinosaurs to survive and flourish as a result of this extinction, rather than be wiped out like so many of their near relatives immediately prior to this point. These remains should help scientists learn how dinosaurs evolved into the Titanic creatures that ruled the earth for another 135 and creatures that ruled the earth for another135 and in another 135 and in years. The find in Wales could be the most important in decades. Alagoas, BBC News. He’s one of the UK’s best known writers and illustrators.

I’d like a generation of children to own sketchbooks and be drawing in them every day. And I want them to think, why am I drawing in a sketch book? Bad guy, what’s his name, told me it was a good idea, that is my legacy. 'S books are award-winning and much loved, his illustrations instantly recognisable. Were not creating children’s books cup Chris Riddell is also a political cartoonist. The role of Children’s Laureate is to fire enthusiasm for books. Chris Riddell will also promote the power of illustration, and how drawings can fuel imagination as much as the words on the page. The new Children’s Laureate is very nice. It helps put pictures into words and words into pictures. It helps us imagine what the writer is trying to say to us. I think it will bring some creativity and enjoyment. I think he will make people want to read a bit more. For those who have worked with him, his drawings are an inspiration. Recently I sent him an 18 line poem that I’d written, and he sent me back 13 or 14 pages of illustrations. I looked at them and went, actually, your illustrations are now better than my poem which means I need to take my whole poem and make it a lot better. This is Chris Riddell’s laureate log. He will appropriately draw his way through the next two years and post the images online. This Children’s Laureate hopes people will be surprised at what can be achieved withjust a pencil and an idea. Daniela Relph, BBC News. If you have a fear of heights you may have to look away now.

It took over three months of planning and a safety team of more than 30 people. He said he’d never felt more on top of the world afterwards. Time for a look at the weather. We may get some warmth at the end of the week but then it will go out with a bang. The nuisance breeze into the south-east corner and a weak weather front across the top of that high introducing more cloud into Scotland. Central and southern areas of Scotland are seeing some lovely sunshine. Elsewhere the cloud is building up in the afternoon but 17 degrees at the moment in parts of Scotland. Disappointing 11th in Norwich and that breeze is continuing to be a nagging nuisance, just tempering the field. Temperatures may climb up to 13 in Norwich and some fair weather cloud around across central and southern areas. Hopefully breaking up from time to time to continue to see glimpses of sunshine. And will continue to stay dry for stop coolish feel across North Sea coasts, the best of the warmth continuing to be into the central and southern parts of Scotland, 16 degrees in central areas. If you are heading off for the first one-day cricket session, England against New Zealand, it will be cool. A few extra layers and maybe a firm Moss flask going into the evening play. The sunshine should return in the evening and clear skies overnight. It looks like it’s going to be another chilly on. Still a breeze in the south, but in rural spots we can see temperatures close to freezing again, so a light frost not out of the question, unusual for the early part ofjune. Hopefully some lovely spells of sunshine for tomorrow, lighter winds and temperatures will respond up a degree or so on what we have today, widely into the mid to high teens and may be peaking at 20 Celsius. By Thursday we do it all again, a good deal of sunshine, starting to pull up a bit more warmth, so temperatures perhaps 23 degrees. We could see thundery showers in the south-west by the end ",,

Along with the job losses, a hundred high street branches in the UK will shut. People are shocked really.

And the 35 immigrants smuggled into the UK in a shipping container. Two lorry drivers appear in court. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, is to cut thousands ofjobs across the UK as part of plans to reduce its costs. Today the bank’s chief executive announced that around 25,000 posts will close across the world, about 10% of the company’s total workforce. 8,000 jobs will go across the UK and it’s thought around 100 high street branches of the bank will shut and those remaining will be re-branded with a new name. To explain why, here’s our Business Editor, KamalAhmed. It has been a business beset by controversy over its Swiss private bank. I would like to put on the record an apology... The challenges over helping launder drug money in Mexico. After being accused of being too big to manage, today HSBC decided to cut its cloth with the UK bearing the brunt of the £3.2 billion efficiency drive. 8000 jobs will go. People are shocked really. They didn’t know this was coming and 8000 people is a very big numberfor the UK bank to find. Up to 100 bank branches could close, although the bank has yet to reveal which ones. We spoke to customers in Thirsk, North Yorkshire. I’m used to going five miles to the bank, if I have to go 69 might get upset. It isjust nice and handy for us here, whereas we would have to go further afield, wouldn’t we? Today HSBC announced it would be changing the name of its high-street business. It says that’s because of new government rules that insists its investment bank and its high-street bank are kept separate, but with 80% of profits now coming from Asia many people believe that HSBC could be looking at selling its UK retail business in its entirety. One name which could be considered is the Midland, the listening bank HSBC bought in 1992. Any sale could raise £20 billion, a useful shot in the arm for a bank that has seen profits falling. Analysts said it was hard work making money out of global banking. HSBC were operating in multiple areas of the world which created a lot of risk. As a result they have decided to focus on a few areas of business in a few parts of the world where they have genuine expertise and they feel like they can control their business. The new focus is China and the bank said it was considering moving its headquarters out of London, possibly to Hong Kong. The UK bank fears could prompt the change, politicians are concerned. We need to be critical friends to the bankers at the end of the day, rather than hitting them with a big stick every time they do something wrong. We need them to become part of polite society. If they are doing theirjob properly the economy benefits and we need that. HSBC will decide on where its headquarters will be by the end of the year. The Government will hope that HSBC will remain firmly anchored in the UK. Kamal, the pressure on banks with additional legislation has been building up since the banking crash. Yes, Fiona, this all goes back to the bad old days of the financial crisis in 2007, sparked initially by the collapse of Lehmans in the US. That was quickly followed by the failure of a number of banks in the UK and a multi-billion pound taxpayer-funded bailout. It didn’t stop there - appalling behaviour by the banks led to billions of pounds of fines, and this man to introduce more regulations and plans to break up banks. Banks may want the era of increasing regulation and tax to come to an end, but with fines still piling up, Mr osborne will want to take care he doesn’t appear to be going soft on the City. Wales is to become the first nation in the UK to ban e-cigarettes in enclosed public places. The law is likely to come into force in 2017. The Welsh government says e-cigarettes may normalise smoking and encourage young people to start. But critics, including Britain’s largest cancer charity, say the use of e-cigarettes can help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Hywel Griffith reports. In bar rooms iI’I i38Iâ FOOITIS OFICE smoke... And bingo halls where the ashtrays used to pile high, now e-cigarettes are the way many get their legitimate hit of nicotine. But the Welsh government wants to stamp out the vapour trail in these places, fearing that e-cigarettes make smoking seem normal, an argument that gets some fired up. As far as I’m concerned I don’t think I’m doing any harm to anybody. They should be outside smoking, not in here indoors because some of the vapour that comes off those cigarettes get to the back of your throat. If it is not harming anybody else, why would you want to ban them? And I am a nonsmoker. E-cigarettes split opinion in the scientific world too, some argue there is no evidence to show they are safe, others say there is no evidence to prove they are not. Everyone can agree the number of users in the UK has spiralled upwards from around 700,020 ten to an estimated 2.6 million this year. The proportion of smokers who use e-cigarettes has grown too, from just 2.7% to an estimated 17.6% over five years. Some feel research has failed to keep up, but according to one of Europe’s leading experts on addiction, we do now know a lot about e-cigarettes. He says that banning them would be unwise. It is not based on evidence. The evidence for the smoking ban is based on a risk to buy -- for the smoking ban is based on a risk to buy -- buy standards, and e-cigarettes do not pose a risk to buy standards so this is based on a whim from those in power. The research is good enough for the British Medical Association, it is good enough for Ao countries across the globe. But with Wales the only part of the UK planning banning them, the only part of e-cigarettes seems to be more clouded than ever. Of course there is nothing new to having different laws on different sides of the border, arguably it is what devolved government is all about. When the tobacco smoking ban was introduced here eight years ago, it was three months ahead of England, but what is different here is that Wales seems to be going it alone within the UK at least. There are no plans to introduce a similar prohibition in Scotland, Northern Ireland or England, where public health officials have gone as far as saying they believe e-cigarettes have vast potential in helping smokers quit. Add to that the fact that major charities are questioning the scientific basis for this band, it is clear there will be plenty of scrutiny over this decision before it is implemented. Mo Farah’s coach, Alberto Salazar, says his accusers are knowingly making false statements about him. He’s been responding to allegations of doping made in a BBC investigation last week. He denies the allegations and says he will document and present the facts as quickly as he can. Our Sports Correspondent Natalie Pirks is here. This is significant. In a statement to the Guardian, Salazar said, I hope media and fans will afford me a short time to prove the accusers are knowingly making false statements. He said, I will document the fact as quickly as I can so that Mo Farah can continue doing what he loves. It was alleged that he had engaged in legal doping practices. Mo Farah had to run -- legal doping practices. Mo Farah had to run -- pull-out of a race in Birmingham, but in a twist today one of the project’s that Salazar heads UP of the project’s that Salazar heads up said it was not surprised that the allegations made in the BBC investigation. Thank you. A former deputy editor of the News of the World has gone on trial for plotting to hack phones. The jury at the old Bailey was told that it was inconceivable that those working above and below Neil Wallis knew of the widespread use of phone hacking between 2003 and 2006, but he did not. He denies all the charges. Scottish police are examining allegations that the former Labour peer Lord janner sexually abused a boy in Scotland in the 1970s. The move raises the possibility that he could be charged in Scotland despite a recent decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions in England that he was too ill to stand trial. Lord janner has strongly denied previous allegations of sexual abuse. MPs are debating the bill which will give people a vote on whether the UK stays in or leaves the European Union. The Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, promised the vote, which is due before the end of 2017, would go ahead early if renegotiations with Europe were completed successfully ahead of schedule. Our deputy political editor james Landale has been following the debate in the House of Commons. 200 years ago this month Britain was at war on the fields of Waterloo. Two centuries on Britain’s relationship with its European neighbours is again in flux, a relationship to be decided by a referendum. The bill the Foreign Secretary moved today would ensure that before the end of 2017 voters will be asked if the UK should remain a member of the EU. An entire generation has been denied the chance to have a say on our relationship with the European Union, and today we are putting that right. Both he and the Prime Minister are hoping the right. Both he and the Prime Ministerare hoping the EU can right. Both he and the Prime Minister are hoping the EU can be reformed before the referendum, but it is clear that some Tory MPs will vote in or out come what may. The European Union is the past, it is holding us back, it is something from the last century. Our effective voice in the world is best deployed as a leading and influential player in the European Union. But while old foes battled it out over the principles, MPs from all sides complained about plans to suspend the usual rules that stop government is campaigning in the final months before a referendum. Isn’t that what a lot of people are concerned about, that the Government will use the apparatus of state to push a lot of people are concerned about, that the Government will use the apparatus of state to push case ensure a balanced debate. In the election Labour opposed the referendum, in defeat it is now in favour and enjoyed what it called hokey Coakley. The Foreign Secretary was leaning out, now appears to be leaning in, others are now in. In the EU referendum, only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 will get to vote, something Labour wants to change. Why not let young people have a say on their future? As for SNP, Why not let young people have a say on theirfuture? As for SNP, they oppose the referendum out right. The referendum is a tactic, nobody actually believes the Prime Minister wants to take the country out of the European Union. This bill will be put through the Parliamentary wringer. There will be rows about the rules, Conservative rebellions, maybe even government defeats, but at some point the bill will pass under referendum will be held. And when that happens senior Tories including Borisjohnson say when that happens senior Tories including Boris johnson say that David Cameron must give ministers the freedom to oppose the Government or risk facing his own Waterloo. Our top story this evening: HSBC is to cut thousands ofjobs in the UK, tens of thousands worldwide. Still to come: Treading carefully with no safety net, the man with nerves of steel climbing Wembley’s arch. Later on BBC London: The Tory MP and outspoken environmentalist Zac Goldsmith enters the race to become the next Mayor of London. And West Ham get their man - former player Slavan Bilic is appointed the new boss of the Hammers. The number of new homes being approved on greenbelt land in England has increased five-fold in the last five years, according to figures obtained by the BBC. Land in the UK as whole is under pressure. Around 240,000 more houses need to be built per year to meet demand. Greenbelt is land which has officially been set aside to ‘prevent urban sprawl.' It covers around 13% of the land area of England. Duncan Kennedy reports from oxfordshire where a new development of 1,000 houses is being built on the green belt. When it comes to colour coded protection for the countryside, green belt was supposed to be the gold standard. But all that now looks like it’s going to change. Five years ago only around 2,000 homes in England were given planning permission to be built on green belt land. Last year, that rose to 5,500 homes. This year, it’s nearly 12,000. That’s a doubling of homes given permission to be built on green belt injust five years. Those new figures from Radio Four’s programme could include places like here, Abingdon in Oxfordshire. The council wants to build 1,000 homes on this green belt. It’s the field that people like Bruce Turner have spent 14 years looking out on. It’s got wildlife in it. I see very often a deer... He said green belt was meant to be safe, not sacrificed. Before we get so overcrowded that we have to have these houses built everywhere and we have no Greenland, look elsewhere. You know, I know that’s easy to see, but there are places where you could build that are not so beautiful as this. Leave green belt to the last? Yeah. NEWS REEL: People want to live where there’s beauty... The idea of green loops around our cities dates back to 1947. The Government wanted to give city dwellers access to protected open areas. But in 2015 the direction of travel is changing. In Oxfordshire alone planners say they need 100,000 new homes in the next 15 years, and so even green belt is in the mix. Nobody wants to build on green belt land, but given the high levels of housing that everybody recognises we need up-and-down the country, we really are running out of choices. There are some very difficult decision that is councils will have to make up-and-down the country on where to allocate housing, some of that is likely to be in the green belt. So great is the demand for housing the green belt shrank by 1% last year. It’s still highly protected, but has now joined wider planning options. There are more than 20 green belts across the whole of the UK, including this one here in Oxfordshire. As those figures my report showed the pressure to build on land like this is growing all the time, which is why we’re left with a serious question - why we’re left with a serious question - how do we protect green belt land like this whilst, at the same time, meet the ever growing demand for more and more houses. Fiona. Duncan Kennedy, in Oxfordshire, thank you. A schoolboy understood to have taken his own life after being tricked into posting images online had been ""exploited and broken"", a priest has told mourners at his funeral in County Tyrone today. Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of 17-year-old Ronan Hughes from Coalisland. Andy Martin is in Belfast for us. This is desperately sad and very strong words from the priest? Absolutely. This morning school friends of Ronan Hughes formed a Guard of Honour outside the church as his coffin was laid in. Last week he had told his parents about concerns he had about images which had appeared online and the family then went to the police, but despite the support he was evidently getting he took his own life on Friday night. This evening, his school principal told the BBC that it appeared he was being blackmailed by somebody abroad. Now, the police are investigating, but they say that they do not suspect a crime has been committed at this stage. Today, at his funeral, the parish priest said that people had taken advantage of his youth and beauty. That they’d exploited him and that they’d broken him. Somewhere in the world, maybe far, far away, is a him. Somewhere in the world, maybe far, faraway, is a man, woman him. Somewhere in the world, maybe far, far away, is a man, woman or far, faraway, is a man, woman ora Gang far, faraway, is a man, woman ora gang who are guilty of a heinous crime. Andy Martin, in Belfast, thank you. The G7 meeting of world leaders in Bavaria in Germany has drawn to a close. High on the agenda was what to do about the increase in immigration with many German towns struggling to cope. Churches in the country have been using an ancient legal loophole to shelter hundreds of migrants. The practice is controversial, but allows those who’ve lived on church land for six months or more to legitimately apply for asylum in the country. From Bavaria, jenny Hill sent this report. In the shelter of the Catholic Church a young Muslim refugee. This church asylum. He walked to Germany from Syria. While he is living on church grounds here, he can’t be deported. All things damaged. What about your family? I don’t... Scores of GEFITIBFI Scores of German churches have opened their doors to hundreds of refugees, by law those refugees can only seek asylum in the first EU country they come to. In this man’s case that is Hungary, where he claims he was mistreated. If he can stay in Germany for six months he can claim asylum. Germany receives more asylum applications than any other country in Europe, that number is expected to double this year. The government here say other countries in Europe must take more responsibility. It’s why they are angered by priests like Father Peter. He has been offering church asylum for decades. TRANSLATION: We can’t stop people coming to Europe. As Europeans, we have to learn to share and help people in need. The number of refugees will rise significantly. For now, if he leaves the church grounds, where he shares a am radio, he risks deportation. The future, he tells me, is something he just can’t think about. jenny Hill, BBC News, Bavaria. He’s one of the UK’s best known writers and illustrators and now Chris Riddell has been named as the next Children’s Laureate, following in the footsteps of Michael Morpurgo, jacqueline Wilson and Quentin Blake. This is one of his most famous creations, The Ghost of a Mouse. He says he hopes to use his two years to encourage children not just to read, but also to draw. Here’s our arts editor, Will Gompertz. Chapter one. Aida sat up in her eight poster bed and peered into the inky blackness. Who’s there, Aida whispered a little more loudly this time... Chris Riddell, sitting out in the sun, and surrounded by young fans. We’ve heard all about Ishmael Whiskers and I want to start drawing... He made his name with his distinct drawings which have appeared as political cartoons in newspapers and as illustrations in children’s books. I want to put in some whiskers. He is the ninth Children’s Laureate, a position awarded to a writer or illustrator who’s made a significance contribution to the world of children’s books. It’s both an honour and an opportunity to promote issues close to the incumbent’s heart. Oh, my goodness, what’s that? Chris, you’ve got a platform, what do you want to do with it? I want to encourage things like the use of sketch books. Sketch books can be a child’s personal space in which they think visually and they enjoy the visual within those sketch books. I’m not sure you need to test it. I don’t think you necessarily need to build a curriculum around that. I think you just need to put a pen in a child’s hand, open a good sketch book and say - fill this up, you’re going to enjoy it. He also wants to help improve visual literacy by encouraging pupils to draw and talk about drawing. If you other people start to draw and they’ll get their kids to draw and then everyone willjust start drawing and everyone will be really happy because it’s really fun. I find hippos quite hard to draw. I like to draw people because it’s just like how they look. How could I improve them? We’re living in a world where technology has taken over, but I think what we have a duty in schools and as families and educators of children is to really, really also promote the non-technological side of things and not to for them to be over-reliant on technology. Chris Riddell says he’s going to keep a Laureate’s log, an online visual diary that he hopes will inspire children to not only draw and read books, but to follow his lead and write them too. What a strange day it’s been, said Ishmael, with a sigh. Will Gompertz, BBC News. Now, if you’re scared of heights you may want to look away now. You’ll recognise this as the arch above Wembley Stadium, which is 133 meters high and this young man, from Southampton, is 24-year-old james Kingston. He’sjust become the first person to climb it. He described the view as unlike any other he’d seen before. I do it because I love it. It’s my passion. Ijust have the urge to do it. I have the urge to explore and live my life to the fullest. Mr Kingston is something of an expert of the French discipline of parkour, or urban climbing. He had permission to climb Wembley’s arch, but other stunts he’s pulled off have been strongly frowned upon by authorities, such as climbing this crane in Southampton or rather, hanging off it. And this bridge in Ukraine, with a terrifying backflip. Climbing the Wembley arch took 30 people three months to plan and Mr Kingston did have to wear a safety wire, but he described the experience as ""immense"" and all from a man who was once afraid of heights. oh, I could barely look. It was windy in London today The wind gets stronger as you go higher up through the atmosphere. Pretty brave. Time for a look at the weather, here’s Nina Ridge. Scotland hit 19 degrees, but there is snow on top of the Cairngorms. Tonight we will keep the breeze to the south and across northern Scotland. For central areas, the south and across northern Scotland. For centralareas, lighter Scotland. For central areas, lighter winds, Scotland. For centralareas, lighter winds, clearer skies, it could turn chilly. Towns and cities eight or nine. In the countryside a risk of a touch of frost. Tomorrow it should be fine and dry with some sunshine. The cloud will affect the feel of things. The winds not as brisk to the south. Breezy to northern Scotland into the afternoon. More cloud developing here with the small chance of a light shower across northern and western isles. In Scotland temperatures will be in the high teens. Northern Ireland, 15 in Belfast. As we move through Yorkshire and Lincolnshire with the breeze coming in off the North Sea we are looking at 14 degrees. Midlands, Wales and south-west England temperatures higher on today’s values with the lighter winds and more sunshine. Don’t be fooled, despite there being cloud around we have high UV levels. Particularly in the south-west area. Many areas should be fine and dry with sunny spells. Cloudy to northern Scotland with this front approaching. It’s the main low to the south that will see the increasing risk of those showers through the day on Friday. Again, you can see fine and dry with some sunshine. The humidity will pick up from the south along with the temperatures. By Friday we could see highs of around 25-26 in London.

On the programme tonight: New safety concerns over a former surgeon who’d been suspended for professional misconduct. It certainly makes me concerned for other people, that they may go to Accident and Emergency at West Middlesex and come across him. The Trust employing Dr Gideon Lauffer say he’s respected and popular. Also tonight: The 35 immigrants smuggled into the UK in a shipping container. Four men appear in court. They often transport life saving medical supplies - but London’s cycle couriers say they’re underpaid for their service to Londoners. And marking 200 years of the Gurkhas fighting alongside British Armed forces - the Queen will attend a special event in Chelsea. Welcome to BBC London News, with me Riz Lateef. A doctor who was suspended as a surgeon for carrying out operations 'beyond his competence’ five years ago is at the centre of new concerns about his treatment of patients. Dr Gideon Lauffer has been accused of misdiagnosing a man with acute kidney failure at the West Middlesex Hosptial in Isleworth after allegedly misreading blood tests. The patient was sent home told he was suffering from constipation. The matter was not taken forward due to lack of evidence. Dr Lauffer had been a consultant surgeon but retrained as a non-surgical doctor after being found guilty in 2010 of serious professional misconduct and dishonesty. Ayshea Buksh reports. Last May, Nick from Brentford was taken by ambulance to his local Accident and Emergency in agony. After three hours there, Dr Lauffer came in, pronounced I had constipation and said I had to go home and that there was nothing wrong with me. He told me to drink more water. Infact, he had kidney failure and blood poisoning and was readmitted and spent a month in hospital. He was also diagnosed with blood cancer. After complaining, he obtained his medical records. His blood test results from that night showed serious infection, and there were discrepancies in what Dr Lauffer had written. Then he looked into Dr Lauffer’s past and this is what he found. We approached the NHS Trust which runs the hospital for comment, we were given a statement. They said Dr Lauffer was employed by the Trust with their full knowledge of his background. He is highly respected and popular with colleagues. The board fully supports his continued employment. I was surprised somebody who had all this previous history of dishonesty was able to continue to be a doctor. The family took their case to the General Medical Council. They produced a 30 page report. Inside, an expert said... We approached the GMC who said they’re unable to comment on the complaint, but they emphasised they do not represent doctors or their interests. There are others who aren’t happy about Dr Lauffer continuing to practice. This woman’s husband died shortly after Dr Lauffer performed a routine operation on him in 2007. She eventually settled out of court with the Trust for £32,500. The GMC is letting us down. All of us. They are not, I’ve no idea how many other doctors... Not attending to the lack of ability of this doctor. They are not protecting the public. Nick is still recovering from his cancer treatment ",,

Later on BBC London: New safety concerns over a former surgeon who’d been suspended for professional misconduct. And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith enters the race to become the next Mayor of London. Good evening. Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC, is to cut thousands ofjobs in the UK and shift the focus of its business to Asia. The HSBC name will disappear from the high street as the bank rebrands its retail network. HSBC is looking to reduce its global costs by around £3 billion. The bank will lose 25,000 posts around the world, some 10% of the total workforce. Here in the UK, some 8,000jobs will be lost and around 100 high street branches will be closed. As our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, explains, the bank is unhappy with the cost of doing business in the UK. It has been a business beset by controversy over its Swiss private bank. I’d like to put on the record an apology... Over charges for helping launder drug cartel money in Mexico. HSBC has fallen short of our own expectations... After being accused of being too big to manage, today HSBC decided to cut its cloth with the UK bearing the brunt of a £3.2 billion efficiency drive. 8,000 jobs will go, leaving unions worried. People are shocked, really, they didn’t know this was coming and 8,000 people is a very big number for the UK bank to have to find. Up to 100 bank branches could close, although the bank has yet to reveal which ones. We spoke to customers in Thirsk, North Yorkshire. I’m used to going five or six miles to the bank. If I had to go 15 or 16, I might get a bit upset. It’sjust nice and handy for us here, whereas we’d have to go, I don’t know where, further afield, wouldn’t we? Today, HSBC announced that it would be changing the name of its high street business. It says that’s because of new Government rules that insists that its investment bank and its high street bank are kept separate. With 80% of profits now coming from Asia, many people believe that HSBC could be looking at selling its UK retail business in its entirety. One name which could be considered for the new HSBC high street bank is the Midland, the listening bank HSBC bought in 1992. Any sale could raise £20 billion, a useful shot in the arm for a bank which has seen profits falling. Analysts said it was hard work making money out of global banking. HSBC were operating a multiple business lines, multiple areas of the world, which created a lot of risk. As a result, they’ve decided to focus on a few areas of business and a few parts of the world where they have genuine expertise and they feel they can control their business. At HSBC we never underestimate the importance of local knowledge... That new focus is China and the bank said it was considering moving its headquarters out of London, possibly to Hong Kong. The UK bank tax and fears over a British exit from Europe could prompt the change. Politicians are concerned. Banks are still causing problems, they’re still being fined, but at the end of the day we need to be critical friends to the bankers rather than just hitting them with a big stick every time they do something wrong. We need them to perform well. We need them to become part of polite society. At the end of the day, if they’re doing theirjob properly, the economy benefits and we need that. HSBC will decide on where its headquarters will be by the end of the year. The Government will hope that despite the push east for profits, HSBC will remain firmly anchored in the UK. Kamal Ahmed, BBC News. Bankers are hoping that the Chancellor, in his annual speech at the Mansion House tomorrow night, will offer some reassurance in the areas of regulation and tax. Our economics editor, Robert Peston, explains how the Government toughened its stance towards the financial sector and why some fear it’s gone too far. The bad old days, sadly not that long ago, 2007/8, when fear ruled markets and banks were going bust after years of reckless expansion. The circumstances were as extreme as anything that I can remember. It’s like a massive earthquake. We, taxpayers, rescued them, at mind-boggling cost to the Exchequer and they precipitated the most painful recession of modern times. That recession was deeper in Britain than in many other countries, such as America, in part because our banks are so big relative to our economy. That’s why the Government imposed a special levy on the banks so that they, in effect, pay an insurance premium against the risks they impose on us, on taxpayers, it’s also why George Osborne ordered big banks to put a firewall or ringfence between their investment banking and high street operations. It’s why the Chancellor ordered the regulators to be much more intrusive in bank affairs. All these reforms were designed to protect the British economy. But bankers warn that doing business here has become more expensive than elsewhere. This is very carefully timed, isn’t it? There’s a new Government in power. Vince Cable, who was regarded as being anti-banks, is out of the Department of Business. I think this is payback time. The banks are putting a bit of leverage on the Government to treat them more lightly to ease the regulations. Now, in the last Budget, the Chancellor announced that the levy on banks is set to increase by more than a third over the next couple of years, to raise well over £3.5 billion per annum. HSBC feels especially miffed about this because it’s the biggest payer and in its last full year the levy cost the bank £700 million, and that could soon rise to £1 billion. HSBC will therefore pay particular attention to the Chancellor’s Mansion House speech tomorrow for any clue that the Treasury is set to change the levy’s formula to reduce HSBC’s burden. Robert Peston, BBC News. A bill proposing a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU has passed its initial stage in the Commons by a big majority. An SNP amendment calling for 16 and 17-year-olds to be allowed to take part was defeated. The Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, told MPs that the European Union had ‘lost its democratic legitimacy’ and had to be reformed. As james Landale reports, the debate exposed long-standing divisions in Conservative ranks. 200 years ago this month, Britain was at war on the fields of Waterloo. Two centuries on, Britain’s relationship with its European neighbours is once more in flux, a relationship to be decided by a referendum. Mr Philip Hammond... The Bill the Foreign Secretary moved today would ensure that before the end of 2017, voters will be asked if the UK should remain a member of the EU. An entire generation of British voters has been denied the chance to have a say on our relationship with the European Union. Mr Speaker, today we are putting that right. Both he and the Prime Minister are hoping the EU can be reformed before the referendum. But it’s clear that some Tory MPs will vote in or out come what may. The European Union is the past, it’s holding us back, it’s something from the last century. The alternative is, I’m afraid, a fanciful escapism route into isolated nationalism which I think will greatly diminish our influence in the world. But while old foes battled it out over the principles, MPs from all sides complained about plans to suspend the usual rules that stop governments campaigning in the final month before a referendum. Isn’t that what a lot of people are concerned about, that the Government will use the apparatus of state to push a case rather than letting the two sides have equal and fair access? The Government will exercise proper restraint to ensure a balanced debate. In the election Labour opposed the referendum, in defeat it’s now in favour and enjoying what the party calls the Tories’ European hokey cokey. The Foreign Secretary, who used to be leaning out, now appears to be leaning in, while other members of the Cabinet, who are for out, I read yesterday that they would be out unless they campaigned for in. In the Scotland Referendum, EU nationals and 16 and 17-year-olds had a say, but in the EU Referendum, only British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 will get to vote, something Labour and others want to change. Why not let young people have a say on their future, which is what this Bill is about? As for the SNP, they oppose the referendum outright. The referendum is a tactic, a tactic that’s been deployed as a means of deflecting support from Ukip, as a sop to the backbenchers, nobody actually believes the Prime Minister wants to take the country out of the European Union. The ayes to the right, 544. Tonight, MPs voted overwhelmingly to get the Bill under way, but... This Bill will now be put through the parliamentary wringer. There’ll be rows about the rules, there’ll be Conservative rebellions, maybe even Government defeats. But one thing is clear, at some point the Bill will pass and a referendum will be held. When that happens, senior Tories, including the London Mayor, Borisjohnson, say David Cameron must give Ministers the freedom to oppose the Government or risk facing his own Waterloo. james Landale, BBC News, Westminster. The United Nations has issued a new warning of a ‘dramatic increase’ in the numbers of migrants arriving in southern Europe, placing a ‘huge strain’ on communities there. The UN’s latest estimate is that more than 100,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean from north Africa this year. They’re being cared for in temporary camps, mainly in Italy and Greece. The official policy is to send them home, but many are heading north in search of work in the UK, reaching the French port of Calais where the pressure is growing by the day. Our special correspondent, Fergal Keane, sent this report. 70 years ago, the Germans built this fortress to keep the allies out of Europe. Today, the symbol of a new world crisis rises around the old Atlantic Wall. It goes by the name of ""the jungle"" a growing shantytown thatis of ""the jungle"" a growing shantytown that is home to 3,000 people. Many are newly arrived from the Mediterranean. Ethiopian Christians building their own church. Afghans making a new shelter. Sudanese fleeing a new upsurge of war. And almost all, like this boy from Eritrea, with their own stories of suffering. 13 years of age? Were you frightened doing this journey? suffering. 13 years of age? Were you frightened doing thisjourney? Yeah. He told me he had seen people die of hunger and thirst He told me he had seen people die of hungerand thirst in hunger and thirst in the desert. There are often as many as eight to ten people in a tent. And there’s tension with so many competing to reach Britain. Last week, hundreds were burned out of their shelters in fighting between Sudanese and Eritreans. I found these Eritrean men sitting next to the charred remnants of their shack. Conditions here are terrible, your chances of getting into England are very small. Why do you stay? Living like this is very difficult. Education. OK. Also, I need a betterjob. Charities are warning of the danger of violence and sexual exploitation of women. All are desperate for refuge. Where do you want to go? What do you want? Here. You would stay in France? Yeah. I like England. I want freedom. On the road to Calais port, the daily spectacle of men and women fighting to smuggle themselves to Britain. Rescued from the Mediterranean, but chased by police here. We’re not animals. We’re like you, they say. Scenes like this are played out every day here in Calais. All the misery of the migrant world is being funneled into this port. The migrants themselves, most of them have no chance of getting on lorries to cross the channel. The police are under manned trying to cope with a growing crisis. TRANSLATION: I think we’re going to have enormous problems this summer, maybe four times worse than last year. We’ve gone from having a few hundred to 1,000 on a single day. We fear the worst. This crisis is provoking trauma locally, Escude specially for those who find a refugee camp on their doorsteps, like this woman who has lived here for the last 45 years. TRANSLATION: I am for the last 45 years. TRANSLATION: Iam being TRANSLATION: I am being treated for anxiety, but the government doesn’t do anything. These people will be here for years. God help me, but we have to leave. Across Europe this influx is challenging citizens and states. Here charity and government combine to help the refugees of Calais, handing out food once a day. Many more are coming and Europe’s policy makers have no answer to this crisis. Fergal Keane, BBC News Calais. So, the pressure in Calais is due in part to the numbers of migrants arriving in southern Europe. Clive Myrie is in the Sicilian port of Catania. Is there any sign there at all of the crisis easing? There isn’t. The Italian Government has said it can’t cope. They are desperate for help from the EU which itself seems paralysed as to what to do. I’ve been to a reception centre here near Catania, the European Commission has a plan to share the burden among member states, a plan to share the burden among memberstates, but member states, but while something thatis member states, but while something that is a good idea, others like Britain disagree and won’t take any migrants in. What the EU does agree on is the need to disrupt the operations of the people traffickers backin operations of the people traffickers back in Libya. That require as mandate from the UN for any possible military action. That still hasn’t been approved. For now, with all the good summer weather and calm waters many more migrant boats are likely to turn up here. I’ve been speaking to some of the new arrivals in the last few dayes who are wondering what the future holds and what problems they’re likely to encounter. Tomorrow we’ll have some of their stories as they navigate their way around a continent that simply doesn’t know what to do with them. For now, it’s back to you, Huw, in London. Clive again, thank you very much. Clive Myrie there in Catania. In Libya, the extremist group Islamic State has said it’s taken full control of the port town of Sirte. The militants claim they’ve also seized a power plant to the west of city which supplies central and western parts of the country with electricity. The athletics coach, Alberto Salazar, whose athletes include the British Olympic Champion Mo Farah, says he denies ""all allegations of doping"" made in a recent BBC investigation and says he will prove his accusers are ""knowingly making false statements."" Our sports correspondent, Natalie Pirks, is here. What do we make of the statement and what do we expect from him? It’s significant really. It’s the first time we have heard what he intends to do. Let us hear what he said in a statement to the Guardian. He said given the time and effort the BBC committed to making these false allegations I hope that media and fans will afford me a short time to show the accusers are knowingly making false statements. I will document and present the facts as quickly as I can so that galen and Mo can focus on doing what they love and worked so hard to achieve. He is speaking about Galen Rupp who finished as a silver-medallist behind Mo in the 10,000 m Olympic final. The investigation alleged that Salazar and Rupp were involved in doping. The Mo Farah says the events have left him emotionally and physical trained. events have left him emotionally and physicaltrained. He physical trained. He pulled out of a race on Sunday.

From 2017, e-cigarettes would be banned in public spaces, such as bars and restaurants, as well as work places. The Health Minister, Mark Drakeford, says he wants to stop smoking becoming tolerated again, but some cancer charities and doctors say the action is notjustified, as Hywel Griffith reports. In bar rooms once filled with the fog of smoke and bingo halls where the ashtrays use to pile high, now e-cigarettes are the way many get their legitimate hit of nicotine. But the Welsh Government wants to stamp out the vapour trail in these places, fearing that e-cigarettes make smoking seem normal. An argument that gets some fired up. It’s vapour so, as far as I’m concerned, I don’t think I’m doing any harm to anybody. They should be outside smoking them, not in here, indoors, because some of the vapours that comes off those cigarettes get the back of your throat. If it’s not harming anybody else, why would they want to ban them? That’s my personal opinion on it, and I’m non-smoker. E-cigarettes split opinion, notjust in pubs and offices, but in the scientific world too. Some argue there’s no evidence to show they’re safe, others argue there’s no evidence to prove they’re not. The one thing everyone can agree on is that the number of users in the UK has spiralled upwards from around 700,000 in 2010 to an estimated 2.6 million this year. The proportion of smokers who use e-cigarettes has grown too from just 2.7% to an estimated 17.6% over five years. Some feel research has failed to keep up, but according to one of Europe’s leading experts on addiction we do now know a lot about e-cigarettes and he says a ban would be unwise. It’s not based on evidence. The evidence for the smoking ban is the risk to bystanders and e-cigarettes do not pose a risk to bystanders. So you have a situation where there is a ban on something which is based on a whim of people in power. The evidence is good enough for the World Health Organisation, which supports our actions in this. It’s good enough for the British Medical Association. Chief Medical Officer. It is good enough for 40 countries across the globe. Many of Britain’s pub chains and cafes have also introduced their own unofficial bans, but Wales will be the only place where it’s backed by law, leaving the debate on e-cigarettes more clouded than ever. Hywell Griffith, BBC News. The Queen has led celebrations to mark two centuries of service by Gurkha soldiers in the British armed forces. Her Majesty was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh and other senior members of the Royal Family at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea. Also there was the actress joanna Lumley, who led the campaign to allow Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain. Football, and England have lost their opening game of the Women’s World Cup in Canada. They were beaten 1-0 by France. Our sports correspondent, Katie Gornall, reports from Moncton. Grey skies, a cool breeze and a queue, Moncton knows how to make the English feel right at home. # God save our gracious Queen...# Mark Sampson wasn’t even born the last time England beat France, for years their speed and skill has been a problem. His response, a team to stifle. The plan seemed to be working, but France always seemed to find an extra gear against England. COMMENTATOR: Oh, it’s a great effort. And when Eugenie Le Sommer takes aim, there’s usually only one outcome. It was in danger of turning into a dreary afternoon for England. Their chances on goal were limited. jill Scott, one of the few to give Sarah Bouhaddi something to do. Attacking was taking some effort, but as the game wore on England’s resistance remained. The Houghton, Bassett roadblock showed no way through for the French whatever manoeuvre they tried. England finished bruised and beaten and yet, given the opposition in front of them, Sampson’s side will be content. Well, it’s defeat for England, but by no means disaster. This was always going to be the toughest game in their Group and with easier fixtures supposedly to come they’ll still be very confident of qualifying. We managed the game superbly in that first half. The longer the second-half went on, there was only one team who was going to score and get back into that. That was an excellent England performance. An excellent England performance. France are now strong favourites to top the Group after yet again getting the better of England. It all feels rather familiar. Katie Gornall, BBC News, Moncton. Cricket, and England had a convincing win in the first one-day international against New Zealand at Edgbaston after running up a national one-day record of 408-9. joe Root and Man of the Match, jos Buttler, both made centuries and set New Zealand a target they were unlikely to achieve. New Zealand handed England a win by 210 runs. For some it’s not enough to go and see an art exhibition, it’s much more rewarding to become part of it. The latest show by the artist Carsten Holler, which opens at London’s Hayward gallery tomorrow, allows visitors to interact with large, moving sculptures and they can even defy gravity in the process as our arts editor, Will Gompertz, explains. The austere looking, concrete clad Hayward Gallery has been turned into a house of fun by the artist, Carsten Holler. The exhibition is called, Decision, and it starts with a decision that you, the visitor, have to make. Do you go through doorway B or A? I’m going through A. You immediately step into Carsten Holler world by walking up this long, increasingly dark corridor made of aluminium, which is designed to disorientate you. You eventually emerge blinking into the brightly lit gallery two, where you encounter this mushroom sculpture which, like any of Holler’s works, you are encouraged to interact with. So you give it a shove and lo and behold it turns into a piece of kinetic art. There are pills that continually drip from the ceiling and beds that are constantly on the move, all the works are designed to subvert our idea of entertainment. Entertainment’s a very interesting thing. It’s a kind of, in the art world, in the higher cultural world of our societies we don’t see this as being a very serious thing. We tend to despise it. But I think it’s a very powerful element in our lives and it’s something that’s really driving us. jacket off? Yes, please. He wants to propose a new, more complex form of entertainment, one that plays with our minds as we play on his machines. Some people on the bridge are quite bemused by what they’re seeing, some flying arts correspondent. Get a properjob! This is quite an unusual exhibition, as you will have seen. And, should you wish, there’s quite an unusual way to exit it. Kate here will show me what I have to do. I step onto the mat, put my feet in here. Tally- ho. I’m about to descend. Carsten Holler wants to confuse as much as amuse. He wants to infiltrate our minds, change our perspectives and shake us up a little. Well, there you have it, art 2015 style. Will Gompertz, BBC News. There was a trip to Wembley today forjames Kingston, a 24-year-old from Southampton, who said the visit had left him feeling on top of the world. Fiona explains why. You’ll recognise this as the arch above Wembley Stadium, which is 133 meters high and this young man, from Southampton, is 24-year-old james Kingston. He’sjust become the first person to climb it. He described the view as unlike any other he’d seen before. I do it because I love it. It’s my passion. Ijust had the urge to do it. I have the urge to explore and live my life to the fullest. Mr Kingston is something of an expert of the French discipline of parkour, or urban climbing. He had permission to climb Wembley’s arch, but other stunts he’s pulled off have been strongly frowned upon by authorities, such as climbing this crane in Southampton or rather, hanging off it. And this bridge in Ukraine, with a terrifying backflip. Climbing the Wembley arch took 30 people three months to plan and Mr Kingston did have to wear a safety wire, but he described the experience as ""immense"" and all from a man who was once afraid of heights. That’s it. Now, on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Have a very good night. Good evening, I’m Riz Lateef. A doctor who was suspended as a surgeon for carrying out operations 'beyond his competence’ five years ago is at the centre of new concerns about his treatment of patients. Dr Gideon Lauffer has been accused of misdiagnosing a man with acute kidney failure at West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth - after allegedly misreading blood tests. The matter was not taken forward due to lack of evidence. Ayshea Buksh reports. Last May, Nicholas johnson was taken by ambulance to his local A&E in agony. After three hours there, Dr Lauffer came in, pronounced that I had constipation and said I had to go home and that there was nothing wrong with me. He told me to drink more water. Infact, he had kidney failure and blood poisoning and was readmitted and spent a month in hospital. He was also diagnosed with blood cancer. After complaining, Nickjohnson obtained his medical records. His blood test results from that night showed serious infection, and there were discrepancies in what Dr Lauffer had written. Then he looked into Dr Lauffer’s past and this is what he found. We approached the NHS Trust which runs the hospital for comment, and we were given a statement. They said Dr Lauffer was employed by the Trust with their full knowledge of his background. ""He is highly respected and popular with colleagues. The board fully supports his continued employment."" I was surprised that somebody who had all this previous history of dishonesty and malpractice was able to continue to be a doctor. The family took their case to the General Medical Council. They produced a 30-page report. Inside, an expert said: We approached the GMC who said they’re unable to comment on the complaint, but they emphasised they do not represent doctors or their interests. There are others who aren’t happy about Dr Lauffer continuing to practice. This woman’s husband died shortly after Dr Lauffer performed a routine gall bladder operation on him in 2007. She eventually settled out of court with the Trust for £32,500. The GMC is letting us down. All of us. They are not - I’ve no idea how many other doctors... They are not attending to the lack of ability of this doctor. They are not protecting the public. Nickjohnson is still recovering from his cancer treatment and is now awaiting surgery. The GMC say the case is closed but Nickjohnson says he’s considering how he can take it further. Four men have gone on trial accused of smuggling 35 people into Britain in a shipping container. One of the migrants was found dead when the container arrived at Tilbury docks in Essex last August, after travelling from Belgium. The four men deny the charges. The Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith, has entered the race to be the next Mayor of London. But the Richmond Park MP says he won’t stand as the party’s candidate unless his constituents give him their backing. Alice Bhandhukravi is in Westminster, and has he said why he’s decided to stand? Zac Goldsmith has proved his popularity last month in the General Election, by being re-elected MP in Richmond Park with a majority of 23,000. Today, he expressed his interest in the Conservative nomination for London Mayor on the basis that he gets approval from his constituents. He said he had been approached by many people from across the political spectrum to put his name forward. He said local people must have the right to say no. So in that vain, he is sending a ballot paper to 77,000 constituents with one single question - do you give your consent to Zac Goldsmith to stand for election as Mayor of London? Zac Goldsmith is famous for his interest in the environment and has said he would concentrate on the environment as Mayor of London and ",,

People do not know all the facts. Do not believe everything you read, I would say. There is a lot more, an awful lot more to this story than anybody actually knows. Right.

Rebecca Minnock fled with her son Ethan after losing a custody case, but handed herself in last night. Police say no arrests have been made, and that the case is a matter for the family courts. Our correspondent Duncan Kennedy is in Rebecca Minnock’s town of Highbridge in Somerset. The news headline tonight is that Ethan has been reunited with his father, Roger. They live about a mile away in that direction. We went over there this afternoon, but no sign of either of them all Rebecca Minnock, Eason’s mother, who lives a few hundred yards down here. She now faces the prospect of not only losing Ethan but also facing a judge in court next week. The little boy at the centre of this bitter parental dispute. Ethan Williams, filmed here by the Daily Mailjust before his mother, Rebecca, handed herself and Ethan into police. After two weeks on the run. People do not know all the facts, do not believe everything you read, I would say. There is a lot more, an awful lot more, to this story than anybody actually knows. Right. Before theyjudge, maybe find out all the facts. There was no sign of Rebecca Minnock at her home in Somerset today. One close neighbour who has known her for 12 years and who didn’t want to be identified, said she was right to fight for her son. That bond between mother and baby, I think, was unique. She knew she was going to get into serious trouble. To me, that is a caring mother. Ethan has now been reunited with his father, Roger Williams, both seen in an earlier photo here. Mr Williams said Ethan was now safely back in his care. Family lawyers say Rebecca Minnock may not be under arrest, but the judge in this case will want to send a clear message to any parent who takes a child at the centre of a custody battle. The court can’t send out a signal that it’s OK to flout a court order. That’s it’s OK to discuss this through the media. The court must think about other people in similar situations. Rebecca Minnock has paid a high price for taking Ethan. Not only has Ethan been taken away from her, but her mother here and a close family friend have been jailed for lying in court over her disappearance. On Monday, the same judge said he will hold a new hearing, to decide what to do next. Including ruling on Rebecca Minnock’s actions. And putting three-year-old Ethan at the centre of everything he decides. The British backpacker who was arrested in Malaysia after posing topless on a sacred mountain is on her way back to the UK. Eleanor Hawkins has left Borneo a day after appearing in court. She was sentenced to three days in prison after pleading guilty to a public nuisance offence. jennifer Pak reports from Borneo. This is how Eleanor and three other tourists ended their holiday in Malaysia, pursued by the world’s media at the Kota Kinabalu Airport. They were asked if they had anything to say. They didn’t answer. But two weeks ago they didn’t seem shy when they stripped off on Malaysia’s highest peak, Mount Kinabalu. The four were part of a bigger group who dared each other to take off their clothes and see who could withstand the cold on Mount Kinabalu. A few days later an earthquake struck, killing 18 people, including schoolchildren. A local official said that the nude tourists have angered the spirits of the mountain, causing the earthquake. In the end, the four were charged with public indecency. And all of them pleaded guilty. The judge said this was a sign of remorse. They have all now left the country but the debate here continues. Some people say the foreigners got off to easily while other police -- people say the foreigners got off to easily while other police -- others believe that Malaysia sent the right message, if you come here, respect our customs. Police in Dallas have been involved in a shoot-out with a man who rammed and shot at police vehicles, after having planted two bombs at the city’s police headquarters. The suspect had earlier told a negotiator that he blamed police for losing custody of his son. It’s not yet known whether he was killed in the stand-off. It’s the Oueen’s official birthday today, marked by the Trooping of the Colour parade, but it was Prince George who stole the show. He made his first appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch an RAF flypast, along with his parents and other members of the royal family. Our Royal Correspondent Nick Witchell has more. It was, of course, his great-grandmother’s special day, it was her birthday parade. But it was also a day for George to perform his first properly royal duty, a first appearance of the balcony of the Palace he will one day occupy as King. From his vantage point, there was a rather quizzical look at the crowds below. Might this have been the moment when the nearly two-year-old started to wonder why so many people seemed to have so much interest in you and the family that you’re part of. The Prince of Wales carrying Prince William... Two certainly seems to be the preferred age for a first balcony appearance. This was 1984, and William was brought onto the balcony for the first time by his father. And this was the sovereign’s birthday parade in 1928.

Trooping the Colour of the Welsh Guards, who this year are marking their Centenary. But there is no question who stole the show at this year’s birthday parade. It was George. Cradled in his father’s arms at the centre of his family. Gazing out and waiting for the fly past by the Red Arrows. At the mall they thundered, trailing red, white and blue smoke. It was a lot for a nearly two-year-old to take in, let alone to make sense of. But it is something he will have to get accustomed to. One thing he does seem well on the way to mastering already is the wave. just think how many more times he will do that. And more than 1,000 people have been recognised in the Oueen’s Birthday Honours list.

Family lawyers say Rebecca Minnock may not be under arrest, but the judge in this case will want to send a clear message to any parent who takes a child at the centre of a custody battle. The court can’t send out a signal that it’s OK to flout a court order, that it’s OK to discuss this all through the media. The court must think about other people in similar situations. Rebecca Minnock’s mother, here, and a close family friend are in jail because they too defied the courts over this matter. On Monday, a judge will hold a hearing to decide what to do next, putting three-year-old Ethan at the centre of everything he decides. Tonight, Ethan is believed to be at his house just across the way here, but we still don’t know the full details of what’s happened. This has been a 17-day ordeal with a father and mother seeing this from very different sides with their son in the middle. Duncan Kennedy, BBC News in Somerset. In the last few minutes, a senior Downing Street source has confirmed that British agents have had to be moved as a result of Russia and China managing to successfully read secret files, stolen by the fugitive US whistle-blower Edward Snowden. Chris Mason is here now. Tell us more. The tools of the intelligence services are secrets. Those secrets have been stolen. We’ve known that for a couple of years since Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency contractor, made global headlines after he extensively leaked lots and lots of information, internet and phone intelligence, onto the internet. What the Sunday Times is reporting tonight is that both Russia and China have cracked the so-called inChristian of this -- China have cracked the so-called inChristian of this -- encryption of this information. A Downing Street source telling the BBC this evening thatitis source telling the BBC this evening that it is the case that the Russians and Chinese have information. It has meant agents have had to be moved. The knowledge of how we operate has stopped us getting vital information. There is no evidence, they say, of anyone being harmed. Intelligence officials have long said that they fear this and this is a fear, I understand, the Prime Minister said he shares. Chris, many thanks. Hillary Clinton has given the first major speech of her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mrs Clinton told thousands of supporters in New York that she would stand up for ordinary Americans and said real prosperity should be shared by all. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, was there. Hilary Clinton! On a bright, sunny New York day, Hillary Clinton took to the stage to take the applause from the mostly youthful audience, though there was the odd person with 9""âY though there was the odd person with grey hair in the crowd. She sought to make herself the enemy of the hedge funds, banks and big corporations and the friend of ordinary Americans. America can’t succeed unless you succeed. APPLAUSE That is why I am running for president of the United States. CHEERING She stressed her experience as Secretary of State, standing up to people like President Putin. She sought to turn a negative, her age, into a positive and unique selling point. All our presidents come into office looking so vigorous... LAUGHTER Then we watch their hair grow greyer and greyer. Well, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race, but I will be youngest woman president in the history of the United States. After the failure of 2008, it’s as though Hillary Clinton is trying to present herself anew to the American people. Hillary, the humble person. The campaign is up and running. The start ofa The campaign is up and running. The start of a 17-month-long journey that she hopes will end at the White House. She will face sterner tests than this one. This is home territory, but the crowd here clearly liked what she had to say. I’m so excited about her candidacy. I’m very excited about today. It’s a wonderful day. It will be the kickoff of an historic campaign. Then she was shaking hands, kissing supporters, smiling broadly. The arduous political marathon has begun. The British backpacker, who was arrested in Malaysia after posing topless on a sacred mountain, is on her way back to the UK. Eleanor Hawkins has left Borneo a day after appearing in court. She was sentenced to three days in prison, after pleading guilty to a public nuisance offence. It’s the Oueen’s official birthday today, marked by the Trooping the Colour parade, but it was Prince George who stole the show. He made his first appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch an RAF flypast, along with his parents and other members of the Royal Family. Our royal correspondent, Nick Witchell, has more. It was, of course, his great-grandmother’s special day. It was her birthday parade. But it was also the day for George to perform his first properly royal duty, a first appearance on the balcony of the Palace that he will one day occupy as King. And from his vantage point, there was a rather quizzical look at the crowds below. Might this have been the moment when a nearly two-year-old started to wonder why so many people seem to have so much interest in you and the family that you’re part of? The Prince of Wales carrying Prince William... Two certainly seems to be the preferred age for a first balcony appearance. This was 1984 and William was brought onto the balcony for the first time by his father. And this was the sovereign’s birthday parade in 1928, the two-year-old on the Palace balcony on that occasion was a small child called Elizabeth whom destiny brought to the throne. Nearly 90 years later, as Oueen, she was once again inspecting her soldiers on Horse Guards Parade, as the foot guards put on their annual display of military precision, Trooping the Colour of the Welsh Guards, who this year are marking their centenary. But there’s no question who stole the show at this year’s birthday parade. It was George. Cradled in his father’s arms at the centre of his family. Gazing out and waiting for the flypast by the Red Arrows. Up The Mall they thundered, trailing red, white and blue smoke. It was a lot for a nearly two-year-old to take in, let alone to make sense of. But it’s something he’ll have to get accustomed to. One thing he does seem well on the way to mastering already, the wave. just think how many more times he’ll do that. And more than a thousand people have been recognised in the Oueen’s Birthday Honours list. Amongst those honoured are the singer-songwriter Van Morrison, and - as he revealed earlier in the week - the comedian Lenny Henry. Our entertainment correspondent, Lizo Mzimba’s report contains flash photography. Hello everyone and welcome... Known to millions for his comedy and acting, Comic Relief’s co-founder has been made a knight. I left school with no qualifications. Suddenly, I won a talent competition and was suddenly seen by 60 million people on television. I never dreamed I would be Sir Lenny at any point, ever. It is extraordinary. # Have I told you lately I love you? A knighthood for singer-songwriter Van Morrison, in recognition of his work in music and Northern Ireland. And American actor Kevin Spacey receives an honorary knighthood for his work as Artistic Director of London’s Old Vic. The black hole is not, in fact, black at all. And Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne is made an OBE. In the world of sport, a knighthood for Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards. I’ve always been part of a team. You’ve got to think of people collectively. I thought of my team-mates and all those guys who helped us enjoy our rugby and be successful all those years ago, which I suppose now has paid dividends. And European 10,000-metre winner jo Pavey becomes an MBE. As in previous years, the vast majority of honours haven’t gone to well- known faces. But, instead, they have gone to people who never imagined that they would be recognised in this way. After raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for mugging victim, Alan Barnes, Katie Cutler set up a foundation to help others and she gets a British Empire Medal. It has given me the platform to help more and more people. I never dreamed I would receive an award like this. just one of the hundreds of people recognised for making a difference for others. With all the sport, here’s Karthi Gnanasegaram at the BBC Sport Centre. Good evening. It’s been an important evening of European qualification games for Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Scotland. A goalless draw for Northern Ireland against top of the group, Romania, means Michael O’Neill’s side remain in second place, as they aim to reach a major tournament for the first time since 1986. While Scotland are in contention for an automatic qualification place at Euro 2016, after a 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. Patrick Gearey reports. High passions and fine margins in Dublin, just two points separated Scotland from the Republic of Ireland at kickoff. Take the Irish goal, the ricochet fell tojonathan Walters who did the rest. When Daryl Murphy headed this on, wasn’t he offside? The officials didn’t see, most of the stadium didn’t care. justifiable Scotland got mat. Maloney took the shot, but the own goal delivered a point the Scots needed. They’re still a way from spending the summer in France, but confident enough to start working on the tan. The first half of Northern Ireland’s campaign has been unexpectedly golden, a sun lit stroll towards France. Only in Romania did they stumble. The Romanians are the 12th best side in the world, according to rankings and clearly a threat here. Windsor Park, evenif clearly a threat here. Windsor Park, even if only part built and part full, inspires the best in Northern Ireland. jonny Evans from the back almost put them in front. As evening fell, expectation grew, the chances became more frequent. Dallas misjudged this by fractions. Romania couldn’t find their rhythm. Somehow shackled. They shrunk back reliant on defence. Late on, that broke down. Lafferty left unmarked. The significance of that miss may not be known for months. Northern Ireland are confident there’ll be other chances. At the women’s World Cup, England have a 2-1 lead over Mexico. Fran Kirby scored on 70 minutes, England’s first goal of the tournament after they were defeated in the opening game by France. Carney scored the second goal. Only just a few seconds left to play. In the group’s other match. Colombia beat France 2-0. Chris Froome has moved up to second place overall in the Criterium du Dauphine, after winning Stage seven - the toughest mountain stage of the race. Froome won by a comprehensive 17 seconds from Tj van Garderen today on the Penultimate and hardest stage of the Criterium, showing his form at the right time with just three weeks to go until the start of the Tour de France. After a disappointing French Open, Rafael Nadal is finding his form OI’! QFBSS. Down to number ten in the world rankings, Nadal is in to the final of the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart. The 14-time Grand Slam winner beat Gael Monfils of France in the semi-finals in straight sets. He’ll face Victor Troicki in tomorrow’s final, as he aims for a first grass court title since winning Wimbledon five years ago. Great Britain’s men’s hockey team have beaten Australia for the first time since 1988. A 3-1 victory for the men over the World Cup winners. While the British Women’s team moved closer to Olympic qualification with a 2-0 win over Argentina in the World League semi-final. That’s the sport for now. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. That’s all from me. Goodnight. Good evening. You know the story, you spend the week in the office, blue skies outside. Gets to Friday, temperatures lift into the low to mid-20s. The weekend arrives and for some of us, as does the cloud, the rain and a big drop in temperatures. It’s been a cool and disappointing Saturday for some. Mother Nature has another cruel twist into the start of next week. At the moment, we have plenty of cloud around, bringing some occasional rain or drizzle. Heavier bursts through eastern England. Mostly light and patchy. Around the prifries of the UK, periphery of the UK, mostly dry and clear conditions continue. It’s frost-free in the south. It’s a grey, misty start, occasional rain or drizzle in the morning. Easing off into the afternoon. Again on the edges of the UK, should be a dry and sunny start. Many will stay with sunny spells through the day with temperatures lifting in the mid-to high teens. Pleasant enough under light winds. The rain elsewhere will fizzle out. Parts of northern and eastern England stays cloudy and gloomy, into the afternoon. Temperatures here only around 11 to 15 Celsius. Then the new working week arrives. Mother Nature’s up to her old tricks. Most are dry. Rain here and there.

You’re only upstairs and he was fast asleep the whole time. Which was great because it gave me a chance to rifle through your flat, looking at your underwear. I didn’t really do that. Actually, I also wanted to let you know we’re having some people round on Saturday, just afterjack’s christening. So apologies in advance about the noise. You know what it’s like when you’ve got delinquent teenagers in your flat. Blokes, eh? They seem to be happy spending the whole day not getting dressed. In this internet age, there’s no need to. You can do a supermarket shop in the nude. But it’s still a bit unpleasant. That’s what the bloke driving the Ocado van said. Well, I can see you’ve got your hands full. He said THAT as well. So I’ll love you and leave you. I’m glad he didn’t say that. Anna just popped in to tell us about jack’s christening party this weekend. Oh, great. I’ve never been to a baby’s party before.

With questions over the awarding of the next two World Cups already hanging over Fifa, its top official said it would be a ""nonsense"" to go ahead with 2026.

And a special concert here in London to mark 200 years since the Battle of Waterloo. Hello and welcome to the BBC News at one. There’s been more fall-out from the corruption allegations at football’s governing body Fifa this morning, with the bidding for the right to host the 2026 World Cup suspended. The decision was due to be made in Malaysia in two years, but the process has been put on hold as officials investigate alleged financial irregularities around the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia - and the 2022 tournament to Qatar. Here’s our Sports Correspondent, Richard Conway. Fifa’s past is catching up with its future. With a storm of allegations continuing to rage around the governing body, there is no desire from its leaders to decide where the 2026 World Cup will be held. Fifa want to present an image that it is business as usual. Russia will host the competition in three years. The organisation’s Secretary-6eneral travelled there today for a planning meeting. But even he now admits that with other tournaments under scrutiny, the process to decide the 2026 hosts cannot go ahead. Due to the situation I think it is a nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being. We will post born the bidding process for the time being. One question that will not go away concerns a payment from South Africa to former vice president jack Warner which US authorities say was a bribe. South Africa insists the money was sent to support football development in the Caribbean. Leaked documents show Mr Valcke was aware of the payment. You have decided that after Sepp Blatter I have to be the head to be cut. Fine. Do not use these millions because these have nothing to do with me. Wider you want me -- nothing to do with me. Wider you want me -- what do you want me to add? Do you want me to hit my head? I think it is too much now. After announcing he would resign last week, Sepp Blatter hoped he would restore calm to Fifa. It is understand -- restore calm to Fifa. It is understand -- stood an election to find a replacement for Mr Blatter will be held in December. The problems for the organisation he leaves behind will stretch on beyond that point. And Richard is with me now. Where does Fifa go from here? This is an organisation under enormous pressure. We saw from jerome Valcke some of the tension on display. Fifa want an orderly transition of power. December 16 is the preferred choice for when a new election will be held. There will be a meeting in July held. There will be a meeting in july to rubber-stamp that decision. At that point the candidates will become known. Some have raised their hand already. Others waiting to see what the situation is. Keeping their powder dry until the fallout is assessed. They will inherit an organisation with problems stretching back many years. Questions about Russia and Qatar. And now a bidding process for 2026 which is suspended. It is a fearsome in tray for anybody. Richard, many thanks. George Osborne is to introduce a new law that would force governments to run a balanced budget in what he calls ""normal times"", when the economy is growing. The announcement comes amid concerns over the national debt, which has doubled since the financial crisis. The Chancellor will use his key Mansion House speech this evening to outline the plans. Economics Correspondent Andy Verity reports. This is one of the few chancellors in living memory to achieve -- This is one of the few chancellors in living memory to achieve -- to get the budget into surplus. Labour’s Royjenkins. The Labour’s Roy jenkins. The Chancellor, Labour’s Royjenkins. The Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, managed it twice. The Chancellor with the most surpluses was this man, who collected more than knees bent, for three years. We will have an estimated surplus of 32 billion pounds. For the Government to spend more than in sync has been very much the norm. Since the War of the Government has gone into surplus just 12 times. George Osborne is proposing to reverse the normality so that budget surpluses are the rule not the exception. As preparations are made for the annual Mansion house banquet with leading city figures, the Chancellor is planning to point to Sweden and Canada were rules were passed to get governments in surplus, leaving them prepared for any downturn. It means we are better prepared for the bad years. It means we will not pass on such a large level of debt to future generations and have to pay quite so much in terms of debt interest. Mr Osborne will point out tonight that he has halved the deficit over five years compared to the size of the economy. But critics question whether a new law will make any difference. The principle behind it is a good one. The government does need to start running surpluses to PGY need to start running surpluses to pay down the huge debt. But there are still some big questions unanswered, such as the optimal level of government debt, the time period. It is questionable whether a future government will be bound by this in any case. What is still to be defined is what a normal economy looks like. In a sense slowdowns and even recessions are normal. The precise definition will have to wait until the budget. Andy Verity, BBC News. The family of a Brazilian man shot dead in London by police who thought he was a suicide bomber, have taken their legal battle to the European Court of Human Rights. They are challenging a decision not to prosecute any officers for his murder injuly 2005. jean Charles de Menezes was shot at Stockwell tube station after being mistaken for a terror suspect. Here’s our Legal Affairs correspondent, Clive Coleman. London, ten years ago. 52 killed. Two weeks later, another plot to murder. It fails. Police think they have found one of the would-be suicide bombers. They rush into Stockwell Tube station. The suspect is shot dead in a tube carriage. He isjean Charles de Menezes, an innocent man. It is a catastrophic case of mistaken identity. In spite ofjean Charles de Menezes being gunned down and an inquestjury delivering an open verdict which rejected part of the official police version, no officer involved has ever faced a criminal trial. That is why the family are taking their case to Strasbourg. The European Court of Human Rights is the final opportunity to hold the British state to account. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute because there was insufficient evidence for a better than 50% chance of a conviction. The family argues this set the bar too high and breached jean Charles de Menezes’s right to life. An entirely innocent man was deliberately shot by the agents of the state. The factual background set out in the written submissions makes it clear that there are good reasons to be concerned about the legitimacy of the shooting. For the family, the failure to hold any individual officer to account is what is most concerning. If there is a crime like that there should be a criminal prosecution. A victory for the family could mean a lowering of the evidence test for prosecuting police officers and possible charges. But most of all it would represent some justice for the death of their loved one. It has emerged the Prime Minister has asked the migration advisory committee to consider new measures to curb the number of EU migrants entering the UK. What is he planning to do and why? He is acting, bluntly, because immigration numbers keep going up and up and up. Net migration had almost reached an all-time high of 318,000. The reason it is going up is because it is not just EU migration going up, but non-EU migration almost going up just as fast. 1+2,000 more people from outside the UK came to Britain last year. Mr Cameron wants to dampen that down. He has unveiled a series of new measures today, top of which is simply cutting the number of visas offered to skilled workers from outside the EU. He will also insist they earn a better salary. At the moment they have two 21000 and 21+,000. He will insist they get a higher paid job before they come. He is going to slap a levy on visas to provide money for apprenticeships so in time British youngsters can get those jobs. in time British youngsters can get thosejobs. He will say in time British youngsters can get those jobs. He will say that visas will only be offered in areas where there are genuine skills shortages. I can almost hear the howls of anguish from business, who will say, no, we want the brightest and best from wherever they come. The difference here for a Mr Cameron is that while with EU migration his hands are pretty much tied because he has to get the other EU countries to sign up to anything, when it comes to non-EU migration, he can impose the new rules he once on his own. Norman, many thanks. Norman Smith. The brother of Leah Washington, who had heard leg amputated during the roller coasters crass at Alton Towers, has spoken about her ordeal. Leah, who’s 17, lost her leg after two carriages on the Smiler ride collided last week. Three others also suffered severe injuries. Andrew Pla nt reports. Leah Washington, the 17-year-old forced to have her leg amputated after two carriages collided. Speaking exclusively to BBC today, her brother described the terrifying hours after the crash. She was in intensive care. She had machines keeping her going. It was only the day after they took her off that and she could breathe on her own. She made a rapid recovery. As each day has gone by she has improved and improved. Her friends say she is a huge fan of the band, one Direction, with posters of the group on her hospital walls. They talk to Twitter urging the band to get in touch. And they have. Louis Tomlinson tweeted last night, thinking about you, and hoping you’re back home soon. She was in the front row of the roller coasters in Tuesday’s collision. Her friend, joe Pugh, suffered two broken knees. Two others are still in hospital. Alton Towers reopened on Monday. It is supporting victims and says they will not face a fight over compensation. Luke Washington says his sister has stood up for the first time. Despite her injuries, she is helping the family to cope. She has made us stronger. We have all been there for her but she’s the one who has kept us going. She has done an amazing. Ido not know where she has got this strength from but she has opened our eyes. Andrew Plant, BBC News. A woman in Belgium has become the first in the world to give birth to a healthy baby, using ovarian tissue which was removed and frozen when she was 13. Doctors restored her fertility by transplanting the tissue back into her. Scientists say the procedure is a breakthrough, as until now, the technique has only ever worked with tissue taken from adult women. Medical Correspondent Fergus Walsh is here. Fergus, what did they do? The Girl needed a bone marrow transplant, which involved chemotherapy. That can damage the ovaries. Doctors stored dozens of tissue samples. A decade later they grafted four of those tissue samples on to the left ovary which was no longer functioning. They put a dozen more into the abdomen under the skin and that triggered a natural hormone response. Now in her early 20s, she started producing eggs. Two years later she had a healthy baby boy. Could this technique help others? Yes, it could. This is significant. It is what all of the research in this area about freezing and storing ovarian tissue has been leading too. There have been about 1+0 deaths -- births so for worldwide but they have been among women whose ovaries were stored when they were adults. Given that there are hundreds of children who undergo cancer treatment each year which can affect their fertility, treatment each year which can affect theirfertility, this their fertility, this gives them an option. It will spur their fertility, this gives them an option. It willspurfurther research in this area. Thank you. Fifa suspends the bidding process for the 2026 Football World Cup because of corruption claims about two earlier tournaments. And still to come: We’ll look back at the life of big band leaderjames Last- Coming up in sport, the new debate about playing summer football. Three quarters of Scotland’s top-flight clubs would consider moving season. Lorry drivers say they fear being attacked and seriously injured if more isn’t done to stop migrants trying to enter the UK illegally. Figures suggest migrants make around 100 attempts a day to get in from Calais - mostly by trying to jump onto the back of lorries, sometimes armed with knives. A haulage company faces a £2,000 fine for each migrant it brings into the country. The Home Office says it’s presently working with the haulage industry to strengthen border security. Our reporter Catrin Nye spent several days with a trucker to find out for herself what he deals with every time he crosses the Channel. I am trying out life as a trucker. This is home for the next few days. This is Ewan. Say hi, Ewan. Hi! Ewan is from Northern Ireland, County Down, and contacted the BBC because he has had problems with migrants getting on his truck. And is going to show me what life is like for the next few days. Last week, and the week before, I had a problem with immigrants getting into the truck. I was able to take some pictures of them. I am qualified as a truck driver, that is what I am trained as, I am not qualified or trained as crowd control, all right police. -- I am not qualified or trained as crowd control, or riot police. What kind of finite you looking at if somebody gets in the back? £2000 per person. I had four Syrians in the back about three months ago. Immigrants just running wild. What do you think should be done about it? You really don’t want my opinion on that. Do you think if you were fleeing war you would do anything to get to safety, you would do anything to protect your family? Of course you would. That is what they are doing. But it is at other people’s expense. This is where all of the immigrants are camped. That is where they spend their days if they are not trying to break into trucks. Does it make you sad? Yes, we had a pretty good breakfast this morning, they are standing there depending on charity to feed them. It is sad in a way. They are treating us as human beings. But we don’t have shelter. We don’t have anything. We are trying to escape from dictatorship in African countries. And when we reach here, in Europe, the same thing. We head into the port. As we queue, somebody makes a run for the back of Ewan’s lorry. He spots me filming. All looks OK. Don’t think I have got anybody in today. The two trucks over there, the Hungarians, the guys at the back are trying to break in. Somebody has been in. The police have got them out. I would challenge the Immigration Minister to come and sit in my truck where you guys sat and witness what we have witnessed these past couple of days. I would like to get his views on the matter and his solution to the problem. Catrin Nye there, on the road with a trucker in Calais. A 31+-year-old man from Cardiff has become the first person in the UK to be prosecuted under false marriage legislation which was introduced a year ago. The man cannot be identified for legal reasons. He was jailed after forcing a 25-year-old woman to marry him. He has been sentenced to 16 years in prison. Believing his crimes would never be exposed, this 31+ Year Rd threatened and manipulated his victim in order to make her his bride. -- 31+-year-old. He drove her to a mosque and said he would kill his father unless he agreed to marry her. He also raped her. Forced marriages wrecks lives and communities. It won’t be tolerated in society in Britain today. This case is a landmark. But there is real concern that this new legislation on its own isn’t enough. And that hundreds if not thousands of young victims are still being forced into marriage. One woman was just 16 when parents told her she was going to marry a man she had never met. When she refused she was threatened and forced to take on debts. just days before the wedding was due to take place she ran away. My dad would say if you step out of line I will bury you in the back garden and nobody will find out. He would happily go to prison instead of being shamed. That is what he would say. He would happily go to prison rather than being shamed by you, my daughter. Gaining the trust of victims will be key to securing more prosecutions. Something which may be difficult to which it. I think it is a good thing it is a criminal offence. It sends out a clear message to everybody. Perpetrators and victims, I hope, as well, we’ll have some confidence to come forward. Having said that, however, we have seen a drop in numbers being reported. The decision to marry is often the biggest in a young person’s life. Despite the legislation it is a choice many are still being denied. A former police firearms officer has gone on trial at the Old Bailey accused of murdering a 21+-year-old man in north London 10 years ago. Prosecutors say Anthony Long fired 8 shots and is accused of unlawfully killing Azelle Rodney in April 2005. Mr Long, who’s 58, denies the charge. The first remains of victims of the Germanwings air disaster have been flown back to Germany. 150 people died when the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz crashed the passengerjet into the French Alps on a flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. Anna Holligan reports from Dusseldorf. Last night the remains of 1+1+ passengers were flown back to Dusseldorf airports. This was a deliberately low- key affair. On the 21+th of March the Germanwings plane left Barcelona and was destined for Dusseldorf. Untilthe left Barcelona and was destined for Dusseldorf. Until the co-pilot, 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz, changed its course and the lives of 150 families. He locked the experienced pilot out of the cockpit before pressing the button to initiate the fateful dissent, and ploughing the plane into the Alpine mountainside. The pupils and their teachers from this school were returning from a language exchange programme. The hearses will pass the joseph Koenig School, giving them a classmate a chance to save their final goodbyes. TRANSLATION: The parents have had to wait a long time for this day to arrive. Fortheir wait a long time for this day to arrive. For their children to come back so they can bury them. This last 12 weeks, it has been a terrible time. Earlier, the families were given the opportunity to view the coffins inside a special memorial space at Dusseldorf airport. A lawyer representing some of the relatives told the BBC this would be a quiet time for the families to be reunited. Prosecutors are still looking into the nature of Andreas Lubitz’s illness. A torn up medical note was found at his apartment, signing him off work on the day of the crash.

A new war memorial has been unveiled to honour the 21+,000 Allied soldiers who fought at the Battle of Waterloo. It is part of the commemorations marking the bi- centenary. The night Duke of Wellington was at Waterloo Station in London for the ceremony. Representatives of the descendants of those who fought in the battle also attended the event in recognition of their ancestors’ efforts. Some dry weather out there, and feeling a bit warmer. Beautiful day in Scotland, warmest day of the year so far at 22 Celsius. This north-easterly breeze made it feel quite cool for the rest of Britain. Today we still have that breeze in the south-east corner. And cloud in the Midlands and East Anglia. There might be more warmth coming. But that means high UV levels across Northern Ireland, England and Wales. Very high in the south-west. Quite unusual to see it across the country here. If you out and about for any length of time with that breeze, and the thermometer on the registering around 80 Celsius, it will not be a hot day but you will need to wear some sunscreen. --18 degrees Celsius.

Still, some beautiful sunshine, and temperatures are going to climb up. Lighter winds on Thursday. Towards the end of the day there could be some fun downpours in the South East. Temperatures as temperatures as high as 23 Celsius. On Friday we could start the day with some home-grown thundery showers into the south-west. But it is going to be a beautiful day.

And a judge says authorities should make allowances for immigrants who hit their children. being banned from seeing patients in A&E to meet waiting time targets. And calls for a big increase in the number of affordable homes being built in Scotland. Good evening and welcome to the BBC news at Six. They’re British fighters who’ve been on the front line in Syria trying to push back extremists from so-called Islamic State. Now some have been heading back to the UK after months of fighting and they’ve brought with them footage of the intense battles against IS. The Syrian conflict has killed more than 200,000 people. It is a war with many sides - which the militant group Islamic State has taken advantage of- to gain territory. But recently - with the help of an allied air campaign - Kurdish forces have made important gains in the north of the country. The British Government has warned people not to travel to Iraq or Syria and said that those who do, could face prosecution. But one British fighter has flown back to Heathrow today without being stopped or questioned. Our Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville travelled with him. On a Syrian hilltop, foreign fighters begin their long journey home. This isn’t his country and it wasn’t his war, but still Harryjoined the Kurds in battling the Islamic State. Time to go home? It’s been a good solid five months. We first met him in the spring, but now with IS pushed back here, he’s done fighting. My reasons for staying have been chipped away, eroded away, Ijust feel like I have achieved a little something and Ijust think it’s about time I went home to my family. The former City trader was at times right on the front line. Covering fire. And took part in more than a dozen assaults on IS positions. At times, the footage he filmed looks like a video game. Suicide vest, rigged up and ready to blow. Even in retreat the jihadists were still a threat. We found a massive IED factory. Go for it. It’s going low. He watched this. Bang! Coalition air strikes close enough to feel the shock wave. But along with danger, came boredom and discomfort. Rotten rations and playings plagues of flies. What do you say to critics that say people like you are treating this like a gap year? It hasn’t been a holiday, it hasn’t ban gap year. It has been very stressful. I have seen friends die, I have been in some terrible combats, and I can’t tell you how tired I am. Many of these volunteers aren’t experienced soldiers, but by coming here they have brought international attention to the Kurdish fight. They came against the advice of their governments and going home could be difficult. We next meet Harry in Iraq. He is exhausted, hasn’t slept in days. The strain is beginning to show. Britain has warned people not to travel here to Iraq or to Syria, no matter which side they choose in the conflict. Harry now faces a 12-hour flight back to Britain, but his journey doesn’t end there. When he arrives at Heathrow, he is likely to be questioned by the police and could ultimately face terrorism or criminal charges. But in the end he makes it through without being stopped, without being questioned. Ignored rather than overlooked, he believes. I think I went for humanitarian reasons. I don’t think it was particularly controversial. The people who we were up against in Islamic State is, well, they’re barbaric. So I really think people, once they understand why I went out, I think they will understand. Hello. Oh my goodness. Finally Harry is reunited with his family. When he left them, he was a city trader. It’s been a crazy few months. He returns to Britain a soldier trained to fight and forever changed. Quentin Sommerville, BBC News. Tonight, America has said its sending hundreds more troops to train Iraqi troops in the battle against so-called Islamic State. Our North America editorjon Sopel is in Washington - is this an admission that the current strategy isn’t working? ~ I think after the fall of Ramadi, and then the suggestion by the US Defence Secretary that the Iraqi defence forces didn’t have the will to fight them in a word, yes, this is an admission that this tragedy is not working. What is significant about what has been announced in the last few minutes is that the Americans are sending these additional troops into Anbar province, which is worth Islamic State is very strong. They are trying to bring in some of the Sunni tribes into the fight against Islamic State, something they’ve been reluctant to do because they have not wanted to trust the Shia led government in Baghdad. That in turn present something of a security problem for the Americans because they are going to be very close to IS positions, but equally for IS them an opportunity to draw a reluctant America ever closer into the fight. jon Sopel, thank you. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is planning to bring in a new law to stop future governments from spending more than they receive in tax revenue when the economy is growing. George osborne’s announcement comes amid concerns over the national debt, which has doubled since the financial crisis. Here’s our economics editor Robert Peston. George osborne’s noggin on our tennis? Not in our lifetime but his desperate to be seen as a sound money Chancellor and he wants to bring in a law that would cut national debt as a share of national income as soon as possible. It will be here in the gold of the City of London’s magnificent mansion house late at night over a truly lavish dinner that the Chancellor will say he wants the country to continue tightening its belt year after year. As a colleague explained. I think it is really important we focus on bringing down the debt. That does mean that in normal years we should run a budget surplus and it would mean that we are prepared for the bad years, and it means we will not pass on such a large level of debt to future generations and have to pay quite so much in debt interest. Since the Second World War government has very rarely spends less than erasers in taxes. As you can see borrowing has been the norm. But with the national debt at a post-war record of 80% of GDP, or national income, George Osborne wants a new rule. At the Treasury will repay debts generate a surplus, in all normal years, so except when the economy is in unusually bad shape. I think the principle behind the rule is a good one in that the government does at some point me to start running surpluses in order to start paying down the huge amount of government debt that it owes but there are still big? Unanswered, such as what is the optimal level of government debt and what time period should be reduced over, and it’s questionable whether any future government would be bound by this anyway. History and economic literature and academic studies have shown that running surpluses is not a sensible way to manage the finances, it’s a way to reduce the size of the state, perhaps, but that’s not necessarily economic insensible. Some economists accused the Chancellor of Victorian penny-pinching that will make us poorer. Strikingly he says is attached to the old-fashioned virtues of thrift and is reconvening the grand sounding committee for the commission for the reduction of the national debt. This magisterial body, which includes the Lord Chief justice and Speaker of the House of Commons, as well as the Governor of the Bank of England, hasn’t met since 1860, when this August gentleman William Gladstone was Chancellor of the Exchequer. But although Gladstone may have approved of George Osborne’s debt reduction law, it’s as well to remember that his age was one of booms, busts and acute poverty. The Victorians didn’t get everything right. Robert Peston, BBC News. The Governor of the Bank of England - Mark Carney - has launched a scathing attack on ethical standards in the City. In a speech tonight he is expected to say that individuals acted with a ""culture of impunity"" and that markets responsible for trillions of pounds of global trade were stained by excess, collusion and abuse. Our business editor Kamal Ahmed is outside the Mansion House in the City. Well, here at the Mansion house, the Governor of the Bank of England will also be speaking alongside the Chancellor and he will have some very harsh words for the City. We have a copy of his speech. He says that markets have been guilty of instability, excess, and abuse. Eight years on from the financial crisis he says the age of irresponsibility should stop now. He also has some pretty harsh words for the former governor of the Bank of England, Lord Mervyn King. He says that previous, or ahead of the financial crisis, the bank didn’t have enough rules and tools to control the City and didn’t know how to understand risk. The Chancellor will also be speaking here tonight about the economy and we expect him to give the first details of the sale of the government’s stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland, that bank bailed out for Âl+6 billion for the taxpayer. He wants the taxpayer to start getting some of that money back. Thank you. The bidding process for the 2026 football World Cup has been suspended because of the corruption allegations at Fifa. A decision was due to be made in Kuala Lumpur next year. But now that the 2018 and the 2022 tournaments are under scrutiny, Fifa’s secretary general, jerome Valcke says the process to choose a host cannot go ahead. He also took the opportunity to deny links to bribery allegations. Our correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports. It looked like business as usual. Fifa’s Secretary-General and Russian officials inspecting a future venue for the 2018 World Cup. But this was jerome Valcke’s first public engagement since Fifa was engulfed by corruption claims. Can I ask a question for the BBC? Sol intercepted him. Could you clarify the $10 million payment to Mr Warner? Clearly he wasn’t impressed. But there are claimsjerome Warner? Clearly he wasn’t impressed. But there are claims jerome Valcke knew about the controversial payment by South Africa. Money that US prosecutors allege was a bribe to secure the 2010 World Cup. So, later, he did agree to answer me in a passionate speech and he confirmed that he did authorise the $10 million payment to Secretary-General, but he denied any responsibility for tracking where it went. I have no more answer about this case, I have no more things to say. You have decided that after Blatter I have to be the head to be cut, fine, just say it, but don’t use this 10 million, because this 10 million has nothing about this 10 million where I’ve made any mistake or where I feel responsible, neither for the decision, the fermentation or the use of the money. It wasn’t just Fifa’s Secretary-General in the spotlight here, Russia was under scrutiny too with questions over how clean its bid was to host the next World Cup just three years from now. Preparations for that tournament here and across Russia are already underway. Up in Moscow on new stadium is already complete. And work on the venue for the opening ceremony looks unstoppable. Hosting the World Cup is a matter of prestige for Russia and its indignant at any suggestion of corruption in its bid. We acted in line with regulations at the time, the sports minister told the BBC. Adamant Russia can’t be stripped of the tournament. But Swiss prosecutors are still investigating. So the awkward questions to Fifa are sure to continue. Sarah Rainsford, BBC News. The brother of Leah Washington - the 17 year-old who has had her leg amputated after the roller coaster crash at Alton Towers - says his sister is making a good recovery.

A police officer has gone on trial at the Old Bailey accused of murdering a 2lI-year-old man in north London ten years ago. Prosecutors say Anthony Long - a firearms officer- fired eight shots at a car carrying suspected armed robbers. One of the passengers, Azelle Rodney, was killed. Mr Long, denies the charge. Our home affairs correspondent june Kelly is at the Old Bailey. And utterly long has now retired, the court heard he shot from close range and fired eight bullets at Azelle Rodney. Anthony Long, for many years a Scotland Yard firearms officer, now in the dock on trial for murder. And this is the man he is said to have killed unlawfully. 2lI-year-old Azelle Rodney, shot during a police operation in North London. His mother, Susan Alexandre, came to the Old Bailey to hear the prosecution outline its case against the officer who killed her son. Azelle Rodney was in a VW Golf with two other men which was being followed by firearms officers. The men were believed to be on their way to commit an armed robbery. On this road, the police carried out what is called a hard stop on the Golf. It was by this pub that armed officers in three vehicles boxed in the car they had been following. Anthony Long was in the front passenger seat of the middle police car. It was from there that he opened fire on Azelle Rodney. The jury was shown this footage filmed from a police car, where you can hear the bullets. GUNFIRE. Of the eight shots fired, six hit Azelle Rodney in the head and body. Prosecuting barrister Max Hill QC told the court: After the shooting, Anthony Long said he fired because he believed Azelle Rodney was reaching for a weapon. Our top story this evening.

And in London: Arsenal’s jack Wilshere faces up to his misconduct charge following those anti-Tottenham chants during the FA Cup victory parade. It’s good to talk. But even better to listen. We eavesdrop on a special conversation. to tackle the problem. Football’s battle with the weather, most top-flight Scottish clubs would consider switching the season to the summer. In a world first, a woman has given birth to a healthy baby using ovarian tissue which had been removed when she was a child. At the age of 13 she needed chemotherapy, which can cause infertility, so doctors in Belgium froze one of her ovaries. Years later, her fertility was restored when the tissue was re-implanted. Another remarkable advance in human fertility. Using fragments of frozen ovarian tissue, stored at this Belgian clinic. Ao women worldwide have already given birth using ovaries frozen when they were adults. This is the first time it has worked in tissue taken from a child, which is far more complex. In children, the main concern is the duration of the storage, because the duration of the storage will be longer in children than in adults before they come back to use it. Also, the fact that the tissue is in the immature stage. How was it done? The girl was about to undergo chemotherapy, which often causes infertility, so doctors removed her right ovary and 62 tissue fragments were frozen. Ten years later, 15 of the fragments were defrosted. Four of them were grafted onto the left ovary, which no longer functions, the rest in the abdomen or under the skin. This triggered a hormone response and the woman, now in her mid-20s, began producing eggs for the first time in her life. Two years later, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Egg freezing is commonly used in the UK to preserve the fertility of adult women about to undergo chemotherapy. But that is not an option for the hundreds of young girls yet to reach puberty who are diagnosed with cancer each year. Now, ovarian freezing is an option. It is very exciting and extremely significant. We have led the way with research into ovarian freezing and fertility preservation. There is quite a lot of ovarian tissue already stored in centres around the UK. Freezing ovarian tissue could be a major benefit to young cancer patients, preserving their fertility for years, even decades. The BBC has learned that Swiss police have seized documents and data from the Fifa headquarters, including from the offices of Sepp Blatter. A dramatic development. The office of the Attorney General has confirmed, they seized IP data and they have opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown. It is a bland statement, but I understand that information was taken from the office of Sepp Blatter and the secretary-general and from the man who heads up their financial division. A significant element, Fifa are denying it was a raid, they say they welcome the investigation, they were looking to hand these documents over. But the Swiss Attorney General investigation into the next two World Cups, this is a further development, and the Swiss authorities are taking this very seriously. These documents handed over as part of the investigation, which is continuing apace. A 3lI-year-old man from Cardiff has become the first person in the UK to be prosecuted under forced-marriage legislation, which was introduced a year ago. The man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was jailed after he admitted forcing a 25-year-old woman to marry him. He’s been sentenced to 16 years in prison. Preparing to make a sacred vow. For many people, the decision to marry is the biggest they will ever face. But for some it’s a decision that has been taken out of their hands. Believing his crimes would never be uncovered, this 3lI-year-old forced his bride into marriage by threatening to kill her father. Having raped his victim several times, he drove her to a Cardiff mosque to go through a wedding ceremony. Forced marriage wrecks lives. It wrecks families and wrecks communities, and it will not be tolerated in society in Britain today. I hope that this case will urge the victims of forced marriage, and those at risk of forced marriage, to come forward. This case is a landmark. But there is real concern that this new legislation on its own is not enough. But hundreds, if not thousands, of young victims are still being forced into marriage. One woman, who we have called Harpreet, wasjust 16 when her parents told her she was going to marry a man she’d never met. When she refused, she was threatened and forced into debt. just days before the wedding was due to take place, she ran away. My dad would regularly say, if you step out of line, I’ll bury you in the back garden and no-one will find out. He would happily go to prison instead of getting shamed. That’s what he used to say. He would happily go to prison rather than be shamed by you, my daughter. Securing more convictions will depend on gaining the trust of victims. But since forced marriage was made a criminal offence the number of reported cases has declined. Young people are not willing to come forward, even though there are safeguard measures in place. They are not aware of that, they think if they come forward, their parents will get prosecuted. Going to the police would be the first step to legal action and they don’t want that. The stigma and shame some victims feel can last a lifetime. Unless the new law is backed up by a cultural change, it is feared many will be denied justice. She was the original TV chef. Marguerite Patten, the woman who pioneered cookery broadcasting in Britain, has died at the age of 99. During World War II she was the home economist who helped educate Britons on how to survive on rations. She first appeared on television after the war and she wrote more than 170 books, which sold all around the world. Si’Iâ WGS I’Io’I’IOI’ISâI’ISâ, She was no-nonsense, championed home cooking, hated waste, and was Britain’s first TV chef. Marguerite Patten said she always wanted to be known as just a hopeful cook. This is typical of many letters I receive from people who see me on TV or read mY from people who see me on TV or read my articles. Pressure cooking is still a mystery to lots of people. I think we had better show you exactly what happens inside a pressure cooker. She said she became hooked on cooking because she liked to show off. During the Second World War, her radio programme helps people make the most of limited reckoning’s rations. She promoted the importance of the home economist. Ourjob is to help people in their homes. There were so many of us once upon a time, going into schools, all of the firm ‘s humanity should food, equipment, we were a very strong team. Marguerite Patten was offered cited as an inspiration by the TV chefs of recent years. Her old-fashioned approach much admired. She was still making radio and TV programmes well into her 90s. I was lucky. If you asked me about my life, I would say I am a lucky person. Marguerite Patten, who has died at the age of 99. james last, who sold tens of millions of albums with his trademark happy music, has died at his home in Florida at 86.

On the programme tonight: The family ofjean Charles De Menezes, shot dead by police who mistook him for a suicide bomber- take their campaign to Europe. Nobody should be above the law, and if it is a crime like that, there should be a criminal prosecution. Also tonight: A High Courtjudge says authorities should make allowances for immigrants who hit their children. It makes billions for the Exchequer but should the levy on London’s banks be scrapped? LAST POST PLAYS. And 200 years after Waterloo, events to remember Wellington’s greatest battle. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. Injuly 2005, armed police officers shot dead a Brazilian man, jean Charles De Menezes, who they thought was a suicide bomber. Today Mr Menezes’ family have taken their legal fight over the killing to the European Court of Human Rights. They say that no-one has ever been held account for the killing of an innocent man - and want the officers involved tried for murder. Here’s the BBC’s legal affairs correspondent, Clive Coleman. London, ten years ago. 52 killed. Two weeks later, another plot to murder. Please keep moving. It fails, but the police think they have found one of the would-be suicide bombers. They rush into Stockwell Tube station. The suspect is shot dead in a tube carriage. But he isjean Charles De Menezes, an innocent man. It is a catastrophic case of mistaken identity. In spite ofjean Charles De Menezes being gunned down here at Stockwell, and an inquest jury delivering an open verdict, which rejected parts of the official police version, no officer involved in the case has other face a criminal trial. And that is why the family of jean Charles De Menezes are taking their case to Strasbourg. The European Court of Human Rights is the final opportunity to hold the British state to account. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute because it said there was insufficient evidence for a better than 50% chance of conviction. The family argues this sets the bar too high, and breaches the right ofjean Charles De Menezes to life. This is a case in which an entirely innocent man was deliberately shot by agents of the state. The factual background set out in the written submissions makes it clear that there are good reasons to be concerned about the legitimacy of the shooting. for the family, the failure to hold any individual officer to account is what is most concerning. Nobody should be above the law. And if there is a crime like that, there should be a criminal prosecution. Victory for the family could mean lowering the evidence test for prosecuting police officers. And possible charges, but most of all, it would represent some justice for the death of their loved one. Today, the Metropolitan Police has been explaining how it will hold its disciplinary proceedings. And the aim is to increase the trust in the police. The government says that is most definitely needed. Why? Because of high-profile cases, the first, the so-called Plebgate affair, where one officer lied about what happened and when the prison. The other case is that of the family of Stephen Lawrence, and revelations that they had been spied upon as they were seeking justice for him. That has led to a judge-made inquiry into the business of undercover policing. The government things by opening up these misconduct hearings, it would be a good thing, and we found out that the first one in the Met area would be later this month and journalists and the public could go along and see what happens. How many of these are there each year? About 100, and in two thirds of cases the officer is reduced -- 100, and in two thirds of cases the officer is reduced -- dismissed by the course, but the reason that it has doubled recently is that officers are no longer allowed to retire or resign from the force if they face one of these hearings, and thatis they face one of these hearings, and that is why we see more of them. Not everyone is happy. The Police Federation represents rank and file officers. They say, why is the police the only professional body subject to this new legislation which they have got concerns about whistle-blowers and how well they would be protected. The Met said that some of these hearings will still be held in private if there is sensitive information and witnesses will be looked after, but this is new territory, and we will have to see just how they pan out and how much of a success these new public misconduct hearings are judged to be. Coming up later in the programme: It’s good to talk. And why the British Library wants to listen - to help preserve some of our conversations for future generations. Should the bank levy - which London’s banks say is unfair- be reformed? The Chancellor introduced the levy in 2011 and last year it raised more than £2 billion for the Exchequer. But amid talk of HSBC moving its headquarters from London there are calls for the levy to be reduced, as Alex Bushill reports. Should we care if global banks like HSBY move their headquarters from London West and Mark there is mounting speculation that the Chancellor will adjust that packs to persuade HSBC to stay. What do people in Tower Hamlets, in the shadow of the HSBC headquarters think? Do they agree that bank bashing has to stop? It is hard times already. The recession has gone through. And who is thought was that? The banks. They are taking all of these bonuses. Everybody has paid for the crisis that was caused by the banks. It seems like the people responsible are getting away unlikely. They look after the big businesses and people with the money and influence. They do not really care about the small person on the street. Many pointed to the importance of the financial sector to UK plc, and the jobs that go with it. They say that just a small ",,

Also there was the Governor of the Bank of England who said bankers who broke the law should face even tougher penalties. We will have the latest. On his way home - one of the British men fighting in Syria against Islamic State tells the BBC about his experiences. I’ve seen friends die. I’ve been in some terrible terrible combats and I can’t tell you how tired I am. Swiss police have seized documents from Fifa headquarters in Zurich, including the offices of Sepp Blatter. Pressure cooking is still a mystery to lots of people. has died at the age of 99. Later on BBC London: The retired Met marksman on trial accused of unlawfully killing Azelle Rodney. And 200 years after Waterloo, events to remember Wellington’s greatest battle. Good evening. Seven years after the financial crash the Government is to start selling off its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, which was bailed out by the taxpayer. The Chancellor announced the plans in his annual speech at the Mansion House in the City of London within the past hour. Mr Osborne said an independent review had concluded that the losses to the taxpayer would be more than offset by the profits on other sales. The decision was supported by the Governor of the Bank of England who said the age of irresponsibility in the financial markets was over. Our business editor Kamal Ahmed reports. A night for the big beasts of the financial world, the Chancellor followed by the Governor, ready to deliver a bit of tough love to the City. It may have been a slow process... George Osborne Member of parliament... But George Osborne looked pleased to be announcing at last the Government is going to start selling its stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland and he insisted a profit for the taxpayer. In the xhoming months we will begin to sell our-- in the xhoming months we will begin to sell our-- inthe coming months we will begin to sell our stake. When you take the banks in total we are making sure taxpayers get back billions more than they were forced to put in. As guests tucked into seabass and lamb, MrOsbourne said selling RBS could take years. This was an expensive rescue. What was the cost of the bail out? RBS was the mega bank with a 2.2 the cost of the bail out? RBS was the mega bank with a 2. 2 trillion pounds balance sheet, bigger than the output of the whole UK economy. It collapsed in the financial crisis and was bailed out by the taxpayer at a cost of £46 billion in October 2008. The Government now owns 80% of the bank, worth about £32 billion of the current share price. The Government isn’t ruling out this... British Gas shares come out in November. If you see Sid, tell him. A sale to members of the general public similar to the British Gas shares in the 1980s. ? City experts question whether taxpayers will get their money back from RBS. The concern about the sale of the Government’s stake in RBS is the fact that it’s going to be doing it in stages. The initial stages are likely to be done at a loss. What that means is that future sales have to be done at a profit so that overall we can break even and that’s going to be a real challenge. The Chancellor used the finery of the Mansion House to finally announce what would happen to the Government’s stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland. But that bank collapsed eight years ago and the City is still struggling with allegations of manipulation and bad behaviour. The Governor of the Bank of England speaking here as well said it was time for the age of irresponsibility to end. The Governor said he wanted to see longer prison sentences for rogue traders and tougher rules to clean up the City. Markets aren’t ends in themselves, but powerful means for prosperity and security for all. They need to retain the consent of society, a social licence, to be allowed to operate to innovate and to grow. Repeated episodes of misconduct have called that social licence into question. Although there is still anger about the behaviour of the banks, MrOsbourne’s words tonight were certainly warmer towards the City than the Governor’s. If the Chancellor can deliver a new settlement with the banks and make a profit from RBS, then some of that very public anger might finally subside. In his speech the Chancellor outlined plans for a new law committing future governments to spending no more than they received in revenue. The budget surplus would only be maintained when the economy was growing. Mr Osborne said the national debt was unsustainably high - it’s doubled since the financial crisis. Our economics editor Robert Peston has more details. George Osborne’s noggin on ourtenners? Not in our lifetime. But he is desperate to be seen as a sound money Chancellor, and is therefore proposing a new law that would bind him to repay some of our huge national debt and cut it as a share of national income as soon as possible. It will be here in the gold of the City of London’s magnificent Mansion House tonight, over a truly lavish dinner, that the Chancellor will say he wants the country to continue tightening its belt. Year after year. Without Sunday finances there is no security for working people. The people who suffer are not the richest, but the poorest. And that therefore, in normal times governments of the left, as well as the right, should run a budget surplus to bare down on debt and prepare for an uncertain future. Since the Second World War Government has very rarely spent less than it raises in taxes. As you can see, borrowing has been the norm. But with the national debt at a post-ward record of 80% of GDP or national income, George Osborne wants a new rule, that the Treasury will repay debts, generate a surplus in all normal years, so except when the economy is in unusually bad shape. I think the principle behind the rule is a good one in that the Government does at some point need to start running surpluses in order to start paying down the huge amount of Government debt it owes. But there are still some big question marks unanswered such as what is the optimal level of Government debt? What time period should it be reduced over? It’s questionable whether a future Government would be bound by this rule. History and economic literature and academic studies have suggested that running surpluses is not sensible way to manage public finances. It’s a way to to reduce the size of the state perhaps but that isn’t necessarily economically sensible. Some economists are accusing the Chancellor of Victorian penny pinching that will make us poorer. Strikingly he says he is attached to the old-fashioned virtues of thrift and is reconvening the grand sounding committee for the commission for the reduction of the national debt. This magisterial body, which includes the Lord Chiefjustice and the Speaker of the House of Commons, as well as the Governor of the Bank of England, has not met since 1860, when this august gentleman, William Gladstone, was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Although Gladstone might well have approved of George Osborne’s debt reduction law, it is well to remember that his age was one of booms, busts and acute poverty. The Victorians did not get everything right. Nick Robinson our political editor is here. This new focus on a budget surplus, what’s the thinking behind that? It begs a question why pass a law to do something you say you are committed to to doing anyway? The answer won’t surprise you, politics is the answer to that. George Osborne’s hope is that Labour mightjust go along with this in which case he will claim it’s a permanent change to the rules of British politics, running a deficit will be as unusual as promising to reverse the minimum wage or to say that you will reverse 9aY wage or to say that you will reverse gay rights. Much more likely is that Labour will resist this, think it’s the wrong thing and MrOsbourne will say Ed Miliband’s successor is no more fiscally responsible, can’t be trusted with the books, he will have done whatever political strategists wants to do, to define your opponent before they can define themselves. There is a debate about whether this is a good or bad idea. One thing is fashionable in all parties just now, come up with rules, come up with institutions to limit the discretion of politicians, to kind of bind them into a straitjacket. Politicians used to be able to fix the interest rates. They can’t now. They used to be able to rig the economic forecasts, they can’t do that because the Office for Budget Responsibility. Like this law or loath it, one argument for it is thatit loath it, one argument for it is that it means that George Osborne will find it a little bit harder to not do what he tells us he is in favour of doing. Thank you. A number of British men who travelled to Syria to fight against Islamic State forces are in the process of returning home. They’ve been fighting alongside Kurdish forces. But the men face an uncertain future as the Government has warned that people who travel to Iraq or Syria could face prosecution. The Kurdish forces have made substantial progress against IS in recent months in Northern Syria, though in Iraq most of the gains have been made by Islamic State. One of those British fighters who’s returned is a 28-year-old currency trader from Cambridge. Our correspondent Ouentin Sommerville has been talking to him and this is his exclusive report. Foreign fighters begin their long journey home. This isn’t his country and it wasn’t his war, but still Harryjoined the Kurds in battling the Islamic State. Decided to go home? Yeah, it’s been a good solid five months. We first met him in the spring but now with IS pushed back here he is done fighting. My reasons for staying have been chipped away, eroded away. Ifeel like I have achieved a little something and I just think it’s about time I went home to my family. The former City trader was at times right on the front line. And took part in more than a dozen assaults on IS positions. At times, the footage he filmed looks like a video game. Suicide vests, rigged up and ready to blow. Even in retreat the jihadists were still a threat. We have found a massive IED factory. Let’s go for it. It’s going in low. He watched this. Bang! Coalition air strikes close enough to fuel a shockwave. Bang! But along with danger, came boredom and discomfort. Rations and playings of flies. What would you say to people who say you are treating this like a gap year? It hasn’t been a holiday, it’s been stressful. I have seen friends die. I have been in terrible combats. I can’t tell you how tired I am. Many of these volunteers aren’t experienced soldiers but by coming here they’ve brought international attention to the Kurdish fight. They came against the advice of their governments and going home could be difficult. We next meet Harry in Iraq. He is exhausted, hasn’t slept in days. The strain is beginning to show. Britain has warned people not to travel here to Iraq or to Syria, no matter which side they choose in the conflict. Harry now faces a 12-hour flight back to Britain but hisjourney doesn’t end there. When he arrives at Heathrow he is likely to be questioned by the police and could ultimately face terrorism or criminal charges. But in the end he makes it through without being stopped, without being questioned. Ignored, ratherthan questioned. Ignored, rather than overlooked, questioned. Ignored, ratherthan overlooked, he believes. Ithinkl went for humanitarian reasons. I don’t think it was particularly controversial. The people were up against an Islamic State, well, they’re barbaric. So, I really think people once they understand why I went out I think they’ll understand. Finally, Harry is reunited with his family. When he left them, he was a City trader. It’s been a crazy few months. He returns to Britain a soldier trained to fight and forever changed. The United States has confirmed it’s sending an additional 450 troops to Iraq to boost the training of government forces. President Obama is said to have responded to a request from the Iraqi Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi. The Americans have been under pressure to reverse the recent gains made by so-called Islamic State extremists. Let’sjoin our North America editor, jon Sopel, in Washington. One of the key parts of the plan that was unveiled today here is to integrate Sunni tribesmen into the mainly Shia Iraqi defence force. Six months ago that was deemed too impossible to even contemplate. Now, it’s seen as absolutely essential. The hitherto unseen secret command centre in the Persian gulf where the around the clock campaign against IS is being launched from. They watch in real time as the airstrikes are called in. The General in charge says that IS are feeling the pressure. I think there is progress in the campaign in a whole range of places we are seeing IS seek cover in terms of physically digging into positions. Today’s announcement from The White House a recognition that IS is not feeling anything like enough pressure. The strategy that we have discussed today, in terms of ramping up our training and advicing and assisting mission reflects the concern about the situation in Anbar province. Until Mosul fell alyear ago America wasn’t taking the threat of IS seriously. The goal was to bring American troops home. If the IS flag flying over Iraq’s second city made US policy makers sittup, it is was the brutal execution of the Americanjournalist it is was the brutal execution of the American journalist james Foley last August that galvanised the public here. Action was demanded. It came. The evolving policy against IS envisaged there would be no American boots on the ground. There were 300 US troops to train Iraqi forces. Now there are ten times that number. The President then announced that special forces would be deployed to hit high value IS targets. Now, after the fall of Ramadi, the US is to increase the number of training camps and over 450 more troops to improve the resilience of the Iraqi defence force. Until three months ago this man was President Obama’s chief adviser on the Middle East. In his first broadcast interview he told me there are no easy answers. It’s clearly an admission that the progress that everyone wanted to see, of building up an Iraqi Army that would recruit Sunnis to work with it and start taking territory back from Isis is not advancing. The fall of Ramadi was symbolic of that. By now people had hoped to be working on retaking Mosul rather than losing some other city. The aim is to bring Sunni tribes into the fight against IS. It will mean the US trainers will be operating close to IS front lines. That will present its own security concerns for the US and an opportunity for Islamic State to draw a reluctant America directly into the fight. jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington. The BBC has learned that Swiss police have seized documents and data from Fifa headquarters in Zurich, including the offices of the outgoing president, Sepp Blatter. It was announced earlier that the bidding process for the 2026 football World Cup had been suspended because of the corruption allegations levelled at senior Fifa officials. The 2018 and the 2022 tournaments are already under scrutiny. The Secretary General, jerome Valcke, has also denied links to bribery allegations. He was speaking in the Russian city of Samara, one of the key venues for the 2018 World Cup, from where Sarah Rainsford reports. It looked like business as usual, Fifa’s Secretary General and Russian officials inspecting a venue for the 2018 World Cup. But as jerome Valcke tried to focus on the future, back in Zurich prosecutors were hunting for evidence of corruption. More documents and data were seized from Fifa today. The BBC understands Mr Valcke’s office and that of Sepp Blatter are among those targeted. This was his first public engagement since the whole Fifa scandal broke. Can I ask you a question from the BBC? I intercepted him. I just wondered if you could clarify about the $10 million payment to Mr Warner? Clearly, he wasn’t impressed. But there are claims jerome Valcke knew about the controversial payment by South Africa, money that US prosecutors allege was a bribe to secure the 2010 World Cup. And later he did agree to answer me, perhaps already aware of the new Swiss search. He confirmed that he did authorise the $10 million payment but denied any responsibility for tracking where the money went. I’ve no more answers about this case. I’ve nothing more to say. I mean, you have decided that after Blatter I have to be the head to be cut. Fine. I mean but don’t use this 10 million, because these 10 million, nothing about this 10 millions where I have made my mistake and where I feel responsible neither for the decision, for the implementation or the use of the money. It wasn’t just Fifa’s Secretary General in the spotlight here. Russia was under scrutiny too with questions over how clean its bid was to host the next World Cup just three years from now. Preparations for that tournament here in Samara and across Russia are already well under way. Up in Moscow, one new stadium is already complete. And work on the venue for the Opening Ceremony looks unstoppable. Hosting the World Cup is a matter of prestige for Russia and it’s indignant at any suggestion of corruption in its bid. ""We acted in line with regulations at the time"", the Sports Minister told the BBC, adamant Russia can’t be stripped of the tournament but clearly Swiss prosecutors are still investigating. The awkward questions to Fifa are sure to continue. Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Samara. The prosecution has outlined its case against a Metropolitan Police firearms officer who’s accused of murdering a man in North London 10 years ago. Anthony Long, who’s since retired from the police, denies the charge. The Old Bailey heard that 24-year-old Azelle Rodney ""did not deserve"" to be shot and killed. The remains of the 16 school children killed in the Germanwings air disaster in the Swiss Alps have been returned home. They’re the first to be repatriated because of difficulties identifying the bodies. 150 people died when the plane’s co-pilot deliberately crashed into a mountainside. A man from Cardiff has become the first person in the UK to be convicted of forced marriage under the new law introduced last year. The 34-year-old - who can’t be named for legal reasons - admitted forcing a 25-year-old woman to marry him. He also pleaded guilty to rape and bigamy and he’s beenjailed for 16 years. Our correspondent, Hywel Griffith, reports. Preparing to make a sacred vow. For many people, the decision to marry is the biggest they’ll ever face, but for some it’s a decision that’s been taken out of their hands. Believing his crimes would never be uncovered, this 34-year-old forced his bride into marriage by threatening to kill her father. Having raped his victim several times, he drove her to a Cardiff mosque to go through a wedding ceremony. Forced marriage wrecks lives. It wrecks families and wrecks communities, and it will not be tolerated in society in Britain today. I hope that this case will urge other victims of forced marriage, and those at risk of forced marriage, to come forward. This case is a landmark. But there is real concern that this new legislation on its own is not enough. That hundreds, if not thousands, of young victims are still being forced into marriage. One woman, whom we’ve called Harpreet, wasjust 16 when her parents told her she was going to marry a man she’d never met. When she refused, she was threatened and forced into debt. just days before the wedding was due to take place, she ran away. My dad would regularly say, ""If you step out of line, I’ll bury you in the back garden and no-one will find out."" He would just happily go to prison instead of getting shamed. That’s what he used to say. ""I would happily go to prison rather than be shamed by you, my daughter.""' Securing more convictions will depend on gaining the trust of victims. But since forced marriage was made a criminal offence, the number of reported cases has declined. Young people are not willing to come forward, even though there are safeguarding measures in place. They’re not aware of that. They think if we come forward, the parents won’t get prosecuted. Going to the police would be their first step to legal action, and they don’t want that. The stigma and shame some victims feel can last a lifetime. Unless the new law is backed up by a cultural change, it’s feared many will be denied justice. Hywel Griffith, BBC News. The composer and Big Band leader, james Last, who sold tens of millions of albums with his trademark ‘happy music’ has died at his home in Florida. He was 86. He started his musical career in the 1960s making instrumental recordings as james Last and His Orchestra, a Big Band with additional strings and a choir. He played two farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in the spring after announcing last year that he was being treated for a serious illness. Marguerite Patten, who pioneered cookery programmes on British radio and television, has died at the age of 99. During the Second World War she was the one who helped to educate the population on using food rations wisely. She first appeared on television after the war and she wrote more than 170 books which sold around the world. Daniela Relph looks back at her life. She was no nonsense, championed home cooking, hated waste and was Britain’s first TV chef. But Marguerite Patten said she always wanted to be known asjust a helpful cook. NEWS REEL: This letter is typical of many I receive from people who’ve seen me on television or read my articles in the newspapers. It seems that pressure cooking is still a bit of a mystery to lots of people. So I think we better show you exactly what happens inside an ecomatic pressure cooker. She said she became hooked on cooking because she liked to show off. During the Second World War her radio programmes helped people make the most of limited rations and she was always a promoter of home economics. ",,
53,BBC1 London,11-jun-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,30 mins,True,"The UK’s terror watchdog calls for new laws to control intelligence agencies when they monitor online activity. In a major report, he criticised the current laws as fragmented and obscure and said a clean slate was needed. With the government planning new legislation on surveillance powers, we will be looking at the implications of today’s review. Also this lunchtime: the government defends its decision to sell its stake in RBS, even though it might mean a loss of billions for the taxpayer. Police are hunting for a 1li-year-old boy after a teacher is stabbed at a school in Bradford. The NHS could be saving billions of pounds a year through better use of staff time and budgets, according to a government-commissioned report. And, a piece of Helmand in Staffordshire, as the Bastion Memorial to military personnel who lost their lives in Afghanistan is brought home. Later on BBC London, a teenager has been stabbed to death near a playground in Islington, witnesses say that he was attacked with a samurai sword. And a woman isjailed for encouraging terrorism through social media. Hello and welcome to the BBC News at One. ""Undemocratic and intolerable"", that’s the view of the government’s independent reviewer of Britain’s terrorism legislation. David Anderson’s report calls for a complete overhaul of laws which govern the security services’ powers to monitor online activity. He says the current framework is ""fragmented and obscure,"" and that a ""clean slate"" is needed. The government is to publish draft legislation in the autumn. The Home Secretary Theresa May has told MPs that threats to Britain’s security shouldn’t be overlooked. Here’s our Security Correspondent Gordon Corera. A Briton fighting with a terrorist group in Syria, his conviction in court, prosecutors said, depended upon being able to access his communications and social media. In recent years the debate has been whether the state needs more powers to collect such communications or whether it can already do too much when it comes to listening in. Today’s nearly 400 page report, from an independent lawyer asked by the Prime Minister to answer the question. We already have a lot of powers, they are strong and necessary, but the problem is they are scattered all over the place, in more than 65 different Acts of Parliament. The protection that is given to innocent people when those powers are exercised is highly variable. This weighty report from David Anderson argues that we need a complete overhaul of the laws regarding communications, he says the current situation is undemocratic because people do not understand what the law really means, but he’s not arguing for more powers for the state, he says they have enough powers, but to continue to exercise them properly, he says there needs to be stricter safeguards and controls. The government today welcomed the report, saying that new legislation would be proposed to ensure that spies and police could deal with a range of threats, from terrorism to child exploitation. In the face of such threats, we have a duty to ensure that the agencies whose job it is to keep us safe have the powers they need to do the job. Getting hold of them in occasion is that flow through foreign companies is the biggest challenge for intelligence agencies and police, it has been argued that stricter safeguards, including havingjudges not ministers authorise requests, will make it more likely for companies to cooperate, a move that is welcomed by privacy advocates. This is entirely sensible, something that has been needed for a long time. The question of whether a warrant should be signed is a legal one, not political, it is right that they should be in the hands of judges. The debate over balancing security and privacy over how much the state should be able to pry and with what controls has become increasingly fractious and difficult. The report today may offer an opportunity to move forward, depending upon exactly what legislation is now proposed. Let’s speak to our political correspondent Robin Brant. As Gordon said there, the government is going to press ahead with new on this, where does today’s report leave them? There is a lot of work to do, the Home Secretary said that she wants the new law in place by the end of next year. There are signs they may set up a joint committee of politicians on all sides to look at the report and then try to write the law. There are signs that the government will not struggle to get it through, Labour has signalled that broadly it agrees with the thrust of the report and what the government is trying to achieve but there are contentious elements, beans within this that there is much dispute about, not just from the opposition side but from some Conservative MPs, take for instance the idea that the spy agency should be able to make these massive bulk trawls of data, looking at what people have looked at on the Internet. David Anderson thinks it is a good idea for the police and MI5 to see where some suspects have been going on the Internet. When it comes to third parties, Facebook and Skype, he says the case has not been made, and he would like for more vigorous assessment. The Home Secretary would not rule that out, it is something she clearly thinks the agencies need in the future. Overall on transparency, one thing to note, David Anderson thinks politicians and spies should be more open, saying far more often when they use these powers and what they are using them for. The government has defended the decision to start selling its stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland, even though, at the current RBS share price, it could mean a loss of billions of pounds for the Taxpayer. Labour has the shares are being sold now when they could be worth more later. But the government says it’s received independent advice that it was the ""right thing to do"". Our correspondent Simon Gompertz reports. VOICEOVER: RBS, the bank which brought you a £45 billion bailout from the taxpayer and years of losses, the cash machine meltdown two summers ago when customers could not get their money, and huge fines for rigging currencies and interest rates, now looking for buyers who fancy its prospects! At the historic mansion house dinner in the City of London, Chancellor announced the historic move to off-load the RBS shares that the government has now held for seven years. It is the right thing to do the British businesses and British taxpayers, yes, we may get a lower price than Labour paid for it but we will get the best possible price. The costly rescue involved the taxpayer buying shares at 500 and 2p each, which today started atjust shares at 500 and 2p each, which today started at just 350 5p. There is an overall loss of £7 billion, although the government advisers calculate a £14 billion gain overall if you add in profits from rescuing other banks. -- if you add in profits from rescuing other banks. -- 502p. In the coming months we will begin to sell our stake in RBS. Treasury Minister Harriet Baldwin made a statement today, following Labour objections to the speed of the sale plans. We have always supported the eventual return of RBS to the private sector, is it not essential that the Treasury gets back as much money as possible to help pay down the national debt. There is a question, if the Chancellor does not think it is worth waiting until the RBS share price recovers, before selling, why should anyone else think it is worth buying the shares? The answer is, he believes RBS and its shares will be worth more outside of government hands, and beyond the reach of interfering ministers. You supported by RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan, who says that he was determined to make his bank the best in the country. The shares to be sold are worth £32 billion, the sale is in stages, starting within months but likely to take years, a public offer is likely later, experts wondering what sort of sweeteners may be needed to persuade investors to take the risk. First you make the bank into a successful business, like for Lloyds, and then take it to the market, to ask somebody to take that risk now will cost money. Selling the bank is a significant moment but RBS is not out of the woods yet. Well, our Business Editor Kamal Ahmed is with me. There is a number of reasons for selling now, the economy is stronger, the RBS needs a good economy, lending to businesses and consumers, if they are feeling more confident, bank will perform better. RBS itself is a better bank, it has got rid of a lot of its peak toxic assets, that caused it to collapse in 2008. And some of those misconduct fines. -- in 2008. And some of those misconduct fines. -- a lot of its big toxic assets. Its involvement in the sub-prime mortgage market has finished. Once that has cleared up, it’s bank should be better and cleaner. I think of course we have got to remember the politics of all of this, George Osborne hasjust got to remember the politics of all of this, George Osborne has just won an election. He would have liked to have done this a lot earlier, in the coalition, but Vince Cable, Business Secretary, not so keen, billable Democrats. The Conservatives do not think that governments should own businesses, they are pro-privatisation, in the end it is philosophical, they want not to run Royal Bank of Scotland so they will sell it as quickly as they can. -- the Liberal Democrats were not so keen. Police in West Yorkshire are searching for a 14-year-old boy after a teacher was stabbed and injured. The incident happened at Dixons Kings Academy in Bradford. The male teacher, who’s 50, is said to be in a stable condition in hospital. Let’s speak to our correspondent judtith Moritz who’s at the school now. On its website, which says that early this morning, one of the staff was assaulted at about 8:55am, and the teenager then ran off site. The school says that the teacher, who is in hospital, is in a stable condition with no internal bleeding. As for the I4-year-old, the West Yorkshire Police are looking for him. The school has thanked parents for support, we have spoken to a fair numberwho for support, we have spoken to a fair number who have turned up, some of them were found by the school, because their children witnessed what happened in the classroom, others had no contact and came down here, they said, because they had seen news of it and were starting to worry. A mother who went missing with her three year old son after a court ordered he should live with his father has told The Sun newspaper they are both safe. Rebecca and Ethan Minnock left their home in Somerset more than a fortnight ago. Well with me is our correspondent Daniel Boettcher. What else has she told the newspaper? She says that she and her son are fine but she does not say where she is, so police are focusing on finding them, all of this follows a two-year custody battle after the parents separated. He lived with his mother but two weeks ago, the judge ruled that she should only be allowed supervised contact and the boy should live with the father. The Sun said that she call from a withheld number, she did not say where she was, and she felt trapped so she left with her son. He is very happvm I so she left with her son. He is very happy... I have lost all trust and faith in the system completely. I know that I’m going to be in a huge amount of trouble, it has even got other family members amount of trouble, it has even got otherfamily members in other family members in trouble, but I have got to put my son first over anybody else and myself. Police have asked her to come back and present even to court, the ex-partner of Rebecca Minnock’s mother will be asked what he may or may not know about the whereabouts of Ethan and his mother. Three family members were questioned by the court earlier this week but they were released after telling the judge that they did not know where Rebecca Minnock was. At today’s hearing in Bristol, judge, emphasised the importance of both parents maintaining a relationship with the boy, if at all possible. -- thejudge relationship with the boy, if at all possible. -- the judge emphasised the importance. Could the NHS in England save £5 billion a year by better management of staff time and budgets? Well, according to the Labour peer Lord Carter, who was appointed by the government to look at potential savings, it can. The year-long review he carried out for the Department of Health is critical of excessive waste in some parts of the organisation. Our health correspondent Dominic Hughes reports. VOICEOVER: Staff, operating theatres and equipment, all these costs add up for the NHS, but is the health service in England getting value for money? A new review has found that in some parts of the NHS, hip operations for example, are costing more than double the amount they should. The report’s author says the NHS can do better when buying supplies. We have not used the buying power that we have nationally effectively. We can get people to get together more and basically trade volume for price. We want to get the prices of many of these things down because we are one of the largest single buyers in the world. Waste and inefficiency in the NHS has been an issue for years. One example is the variation in what is spent on even the most basic products. So one hospital pays £2.39 for a box of latex gloves. Another, more than double that, £5.44. Aprons can vary from £2.51 to £4.20, and blankets from £17 to £25. Over the past few years one clinic in London has tried to improve its efficiency. Rather than prescribe a whole box of dressings to treat a wound, patients now get one or two at a time, as and when they need them. It may sound like a small change, but it’s had a big impact. Once a patient has a prescription, it’s legally theirs. You can’t take it away if they change their mind, the patient doesn’t like it or they don’t need ten of the dressings out of a 20 pack, so the accumulation of waste is quite enormous. just as important is the £45 billion the NHS in England spends on staff, so improving the management of rotas and shift patterns, sickness and holidays, could cut costs. But some warn the problem is easy to identify. Doing something about it is much harder. Why is it we keep having the same reports every three or four years, identifying the source of savings? I think we have to conclude the process of getting the detailed change right the way down in the guts of organisations and having difficult conversations with clinicians is very difficult. -- Why is it we keep having the same reports every three or four years, identifying these sorts of savings? The Department of Health says those hospitals that get the best value for money will be able to focus more on patient care. Our top story this lunchtime.

Prince Harry hasjoined family and friends of military personnel who lost their lives in Afghanistan - at a special service of dedication to inaugurate the Bastion Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The memorial bears the names of all 453 UK personnel who died in Afghanistan. Military representatives and charities, and the UK’s Nato allies, are all represented at the service. Our correspondent Andrew Plant is there. The memorial wall at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan became a very special place for soldiers there. Each time someone lost their life in the conflict, soldiers would gather, there would be silence, the flags would come down and the Last Post would be played. When the Last Post would be played. Whether UK withdrew from Afghanistan it was important the war came back. Now it has and has its own place, here on home soil. Today, for the first time, jackie Thomson can see her husband’s name on the Bastion Memorial. He was very proud to serve his country. He wanted to go and help make a difference. Senioraircraftman wanted to go and help make a difference. Senior aircraftman Gary Thomson died when his vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. I’m just glad the Bastion Memorial has had a home to come to in the National Memorial Arboretum and it’s a place I think I can come with my family and pay my respects to Gary, the soldier, and the rest of our military personnel. It’s a very important place and an important day for me as well. In Camp Bastion, the memorial wall became a focus for reflection and grief. For every UK military life lost in the fighting in Afghanistan. Eventually listing all in Afghanistan. Eventually listing all 453 service men and women who died. In October, it was taken down, a symbol of remembrance the Afghan desert of Helmand province, now recreated back on home soil. Having something which has set foot on Afghan soil, to have it back, repatriated back, is a massive, massive, it gives you a connection from the war zone back to hear is home soil and it is tangible, being here at the memorial itself. This afternoon, Prince Harry himself a veteran of two tours of Afghanistan, will attend a dedication ceremony. There will also be a silence to remember those whose names will now forever stand here in Staffordshire, side-by-side. jackie Thompson was asked well this memorial was being constructed whether there was anything she would like to include in the concrete, so she gave them a locket, a very special locket, that had been given to her by her husband before he died. It is now forever embedded in this war, directly behind her husband’s name. British student Eleanor Hawkins from Derby is one of four tourists being held in Malaysia after it’s alleged they posed for nude photographs on Mount Kinabalu. A Malaysian government minister has claimed their disrespect led to an earthquake in the area which killed 18 people. Sangita Myska reports. Standing on top of one of Malaysia’s most sacred mountains, these backpackers thought they were being funny. Stripping off, taking photographs of themselves, and then allegedly urinating on the place local people believe their ancestors’ spirits reside. Among the group was British woman Eleanor Hawkins. She along with others is now under arrest for offending public decency. Her father, Tim, says she is very sorry for what she has done and is obviously quite scared and upset. She knows what she did was stupid and disrespectful. She has never been in any sort of trouble before. Surrounded by reporters, the backpackers dressed in purple appeared in court for the first time. Officials in this socially conservative country said the maximum penalty they would face if found guilty would be a three-month prison sentence, a fine, or both. In another development it has emerged that this man, a Canadian blogger, has also been arrested. His website had linked to the nude photographs. Trekkers, climbers, who stripped down and got naked on top of Mount Kinabalu, which it turns out is a sacred mountain. He then recorded this expletive laden video, criticising a local politician who had blamed the backpackers for angering the mountains spirits and causing an earthquake in which 18 people were killed. Mount Kinabalu is a UNESCO World Heritage site and according to a police report the backpackers who had stripped off swore at a local guide who had attempted to stop them. Eleanor Hawkins’ parents say they are in close contact with the Foreign Office and are appealing to the authorities in Malaysia for leniency. An Italian coastguard ship will dock in Sicily later today, having rescued hundreds more migrants stranded in the Mediterranean overnight. It’s been one of the busiest weeks for patrols looking for people who’ve set sail from Libya - with many hundreds being picked up so far. The EU decided to increase naval patrols after the deaths of more than 800 migrants in April when their boat capsized. Clive Myrie has this report now from Pozzallo in Sicily. This Italian coastguard ship has been busy, very busy, in the last few weeks and look at this - this is the cargo that it has on board. Scores and scores of migrants, rescued as part of several big operations in the Mediterranean Sea. They were picked up in boats that were listing, that were beginning to sink, and these people are very, very lucky to be alive. So they’re finally here now, on dry land. They’ve just been through a tent, where their details are taken, they’re photographed, their ages, their names, where they’ve come from, and in this tent here they’ll get a bit of a health check. We know that many of them are suffering from the effects of scabies, because of the unsanitary conditions they were held in by the traffickers in Libya, before they made the journey across the Mediterranean. We know that some of the women have also been sexually abused and some of the men are showing signs of having been beaten. And among the migrants, of course, the men accused of trafficking them. Excuse me, you’re accused of trafficking people. What do you have to say? Do you have anything to say? And in another part of the docks, not far from the coastguard vessel, are migrant boats from pastjourneys. Strewn all over the place the life jackets left abandoned, on the floor some personal effects, people’s training shoes, some sandals, even an empty can of sardines. The sad truth is that these hulks left abandoned are symbols of hope for those people who were on board, clearly, they wanted to come to Europe, and also sad memorials to those who died, to those who didn’t make it, drowned at sea. The fact is before this crisis is over more people are likely to die. Clive Myrie reporting there from Sicily.

After a staggering 200 days in space, astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti is on her way back to Earth. The Italian has broken the record for the most time spent in space by a woman, and is due to touchdown in Kazakhstan this afternoon. Our science correspondent Pallab Ghosh has the story. Things couldn’t be better for Samantha Cristoforetti. She is an astronaut, air force pilot, Samantha Cristoforetti. She is an astronaut, airforce pilot, engineer and now she holds the record for the longest uninterrupted space flight for a woman and any European astronaut. Captain Christopher Etty will have been in space for 200 days. She set off on her mission last November, from Kazakhstan. She has captured the imagination of the public in her native Italy, with her cooking demonstrations. I will try to use instead of a plate. We have plenty of those, they are handing up here. -- plenty of those, they are handing up here. -- they are useful up here. People have been fascinated by her hair cut in space. And the extra body, it seems to having zero G. She has been an inspiration to schoolchildren. Every two weeks we have a short conference. With her broadcasts from the space station. Going into space is a serious business. You have very talented men and women doing this. All credit to Samantha Cristoforetti, she is a captain in the air force, she had a distinguished career before being an astronaut and she is using it to good effect. She is a role model. There were hugs as she said her goodbyes last night. Separation of her Soyuz capsule from the space station went smoothly. And it has now re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere. It will land in Kazakhstan shortly bringing an end her historic mission. The nation has spoken, and now we can reveal the UK’s favourite bird. It’s the Christmas card favourite - the robin. The campaign was launched in March and since then over 200,000 members of the public voted, including lots of schoolchildren, whose votes played a big part- as our correspondent Duncan Kennedy will tell us. Welcome to Build World in Surrey, where they like their birds a bit more exotic, like these wonderful avocets. When it comes to voting the great British public has gone in a different direction, opting for something else which is cute, red breasted and traditional. We present the robin, now officially voted Britain’s’s favourite bird. The robin has won the contest for Britain’s favourite bird. What do you think about that? Top of the list. Excellent. 75,000 people chose the robin, around one third of the 200,000 people who voted. It’s a beautiful bird. It’s very English. What do you think about the robin coming out on top? It’s good, it deserves credit. My name is Robyn, so I’m really pleased. In second place, the barn owl, with 50,000 fewer votes than the robin, a disappointment to some people who bring their own baggage to this argument. The robin is territorial, but an owl is a popular bird. Beaten by a big’s length into third place was the much loved blackbird, another on the short list of ten British birds public was asked to choose from. We have not got a national bird and we need one! All in a competition organised by bird specialist David Lynn Doe, who says it’s time the cut country had its own national bird. I’m ecstatic we have a national bird. The robin is a great bird, quick to defend its territory, feisty, it stands up for itself and its a bit like the British Isles, these islands reflect that bird and the bird reflects the islands. Other birds all scored thousands of votes, not enough to ruffle the feathers of robin read best, the bird of Britain. Of course, Britain has been some way behind the other countries in this. The United States as its bald eagle, India has its peacock, but finally we have now caught up. The robin, the national bird for a nation of bird lovers. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Peter Gibbs. There is some warm orange colours on mY There is some warm orange colours on my map at the moment. It is not going to last all that long.

Across northern England, Wales, Northern Ireland and southern Scotland, the winds are light, temperatures average, feeling warmer than that. Quite cool across the North West of Scotland, coolest guys. The pollen levels here are low, which can’t be said for the rest of the UK, particularly across England and Wales, high pollen levels.

That will be enough to spark off some heavy showers, particularly through the afternoon and into the evening. Anywhere from the Midlands and North Wales northwards, dry and fine. Once the showers get going, they could be heavy enough to cause problems. There is the potential for heavy downpours. Perhaps in time for Friday evening’s rush hour. Localised flooding is a possibility. By Saturday, a band of persistent rain across central parts of the UK, fairly warm and humid to the south of that but there is the first signs of the colder weather moving in from the north. Some parts of southern Scotland and northern England could be 10 degrees lower compared to today. On Sunday, the rain starts to fizzle out.

A 1li-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a teacher was stabbed at a school in Bradford this morning. 50-year-old Vincent Uzomah was attacked in a classroom full of pupils at Dixons Kings academy just before 9am. It’s understood he was a supply teacher who’d been at the school forjust a few weeks. He is in a stable condition in hospital. judith Moritz is outside the school in Bradford. Dixons Kings Academy was trying to function as normal today, with lessons running and school open. But the police presence outside was a result of the situation inside, when at the start of lessons, a teacher was attacked by a pupil with a knife, whilst other children looked on. I saw what happened. Hejust stab stabbed him and he ran off. A polite teacher. Never shouted. That’s it. The teacher, Vincent Uzomah, is understood only to have been working at the school for a few weeks. He’s now stable in hospital. His injury is not said to be life threatening T police said they were looking for the 1lI-year-old student who had fled from the school after the stabbing. The school rang me. They said, the children are safe. As the news spread, parents started to to arrive at the school gates. Your son saw it happen. He is OK. He’s OK. You were able to speak to him yourself? He said I’m OK. The last half an hour I was trying to ring them. No-one was replying on the phone, the school phone. That’s why I am quite worried about my daughters. The school stayed open, with counsellors on hand and police talking to children who saw what happened. All students are safe and calm and have responded with calm maturity during a difficult time for our school. The police are looking into the lead-up to this incident. There was nothing in school that may have led up to it. There may have been others outside the school who may have known something. Later this afternoon the police confirmed they found the 1lI-year-old pupil in the centre of Bradford. Recently we have arrested a I1+-year-old male in connection with the offence. He’s in custody on suspicion of attempted murder. As the school day ended, some parents came to walk their children away from the building. Tonight, their teacher is still being treated in hospital. His family by his side. It has been a very difficult day at this school. Pupils here needing support from councillors, staff needing reassurance and parents coming to the gates all day asking for information. Tonight, a teenage boy in police custody, on suspicion of attempted murder. Thank you. A landmark report on the powers of the police and the security services, to monitor communications, says current laws are ""undemocratic"" and must be replaced. David Anderson, who’s the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, says intelligence agencies should retain the power to intercept phone calls and e-mails, but it should be up tojudges, rather than ministers, to approve each warrant. Our security correspondent, Gordon Corera, reports. A British terrorist who fought in Iraq and Syria. A gang smuggling millions of pounds woth of heroin. A taxi driver, murdered at a Derbyshire railway station. In each case those responsible were convicted because the state could gather data from the internet and mobile phones do. Police and spies have too little or too much power to listen in? Today’s report by an independent lawyer appointed by the Prime Minister says although the current scope is about right, crucially the law Governing the powers needs a radical overhaul. We’ve got a lot of powers already. They are very strong powers. A lot are very necessarily powers. The problem is they are scatteredle over the place. They are in more than 65 different acts of Parliament. And the protection that is given to innocent people when those powers are exercised is highly variable. 50 years ago, intercepting someone’s communications was relatively straightforward. All you had to do was come to a telephone exchange and put crocodile clips on to a phone line to listen. Technology has changed. Communicating over the internet means more and more data is not held in Britain but abroad, especially in the US. That has led to tensions. For instance n the case of the murderer of Lee Rigby with accusations like Facebook could have done more to monitor the messages of his killers. Last year there were 2800 warrants to intercept the content of communications. Each signed by a minister. content of communications. Each signed bya minister. And more content of communications. Each signed by a minister. And more than half a million requests for data about communications. For instance, who called who, but not what they said. These are often made and authorised by police. Today’s report calls for increased scrutiny by having judges, not politician, sign off intercept warrants and sensitive cases. That may make it easier for foreign companies to help and it has been welcomed by one journalist, hoed what his phone records secretly taken to find his sources. It is crucial that the Government listen to David Anderson, we think. And enact a lot of these things, putting the power in the hands ofjudges away from police officers often junior police officers, if they do things will change but we hope the Home Secretary will list on the this. In the past, proposals for new powers were branded a snooper’s charter and abandoned. Today, the Government welcomed the report, but was careful about committing to all of its elements as it draws up a new law. We need to ensure, as the criminals change the way they communicate that we update the legislation and ensure our security agencies and police have the powers that they need. After years of fractious debate on security and privacy, today’s report may offer a route forward on how much the state should be able to listen in. after being found in contempt of court in relation to a woman, who In Bristol, a man is being held in custody overnight, disappeared with her three-year-old son, after losing a custody battle. Police are searching for Rebecca Minnock, who went missing two weeks ago and contacted a newspaper to say that she and her son Ethan are well. Andrew Butt, who is the partner of Rebecca Minnock’s mother, is facing a custodial sentence. jon Kay is at Bristol Crown Court. The last confirmed sighting of Rebecca Minnock and her son was two weeks ago now, near their home in Somerset. It happened just before the courts had told her that she had to hand over the little boy to her former partner. The police have been searching for them ever since. In the last hour, dramatic developments here at Bristol Crown Court. A family friend has been sent to jail. He’s being held in custody overnight. He will be sentenced tomorrow for what thejudge overnight. He will be sentenced tomorrow for what the judge said was a contempt of court. This man is called Andrew Butt. He is a lorry driver.

He told a police officer that he would rather go to jail for ten years than tell the authorities where the mother and son had gone. Rebecca Minnock herself has told the Sun newspaper in a phone call that the pair are newspaper in a phone call that the pairare fine, but newspaper in a phone call that the pair are fine, but she wants to spend every moment she can with her son. In the last few minutes, her mother left court here. She was here too this afternoon. She covered over her face as she walked out. When I said what is your message to your daughter? She said, ""We love you."" An army officer, in charge of a military exercise in the Brecon Beacons, has told an inquest into the deaths of three soldiers that he hadn’t realised the training march was taking place on the hottest day of the year. Lance Corporals Craig Roberts, Edward Maher and Corporaljames Dunsby collapsed with heatstroke in july 2013 and later died. Hywel Griffith is in the Brecon Beacons. Many walkers will be familiar with the beauty here, familiar with the sight of soldiers training here in all conditions. Two years ago in temperatures of 27 Celsius, three part-time soldiers lost their lives after taking part in a march. Today, we finally heard from the officer in charge of that march and took an important step forward in trying to understand what went wrong. Rugged and relentdless, Britain’s -- relentless, Britain’s Special Forces push their recruits to extremes. Were some pushed too far? On the hottest day of 2013, three reservists who wanted to serve in the SAS lost their lives after try togs complete a 16-mile test march. james Dunsby had served in the heat of Afghanistan. He died after becoming overheated. Edward Maher was described Hezbollah family as being -- was described Hezbollah family as being-- described by his family as extremely fit. Craig Roberts, when his parents identified his body, they were told cancelling the march would have involved too much paperwork. A paramedic said one of them had the highest body temperature he had ever recorded. Today, the court’s commander told the inquest there was no no reason to discuss the weather conditions beforehand. He had not been trained to write risk assessments. The test march is meant to be gruelling. The Ministry of Defence does have guidance which suggests exercises should be cancelled if soldiers show signs of heat illness. Today, the officer in charge said he was not aware of that at the time. The men’s families have waited nearly two years to hear answers to some of their questions. The inquest only starts to shine a light on the secretive world of the Special Forces. As they learn more of what happened on these hills, one vital question remains: Should more have been done to protect those who sought to serve? The British film star Christopher Lee has died at the age of 93. He made his name in the era of the Hammer Horror films - most famously playing Dracula. He also starred in The Wicker Man and as the Bond villain Scaramanga. In total he made more than 250 films. Nick Higham looks back at his career.

Savage, but above all, which I think is the most important thing when you are playing characters of this kind,or meanted, agonised, sad. What a ghastly fate. To be immortal. Christopher Lee was half English, half Italian. His mother was a Contessa. They said he was too tall and foreign-looking to become a film actor. That didn’t stop him.

They survived the perilous journey across the Mediterranean. Now tens of thousands of migrants from north Africa have been heading through Italy towards northern Europe in search of a better life. Officials in the city of Milan say more than 64,000 migrants have passed through Milan’s main train station injust over 18 months. Italy’s calling for the rest of Europe to do more to help with the crisis. Clive Myrie is in Sicily, where people continue to arrive in large numbers. The situation in Milan is part of what’s becoming a great migration north, people are rescued at sea in southern Europe, a region economically depressed where there are fewer job economically depressed where there are fewerjob opportunities. They try to head further north to the likes of Germany and the UK, where new lives are ease dwror build. Meanwhile -- new lives are ease dwror build. Meanwhile -- easier to build. Meanwhile Europe’s leaders are struggling with how best to deal with the influx. We’ve been allowed on board an Italian coastguard ship. These passengers, plucked from the Mediterranean, are now caught between two worlds. Where have you come from? Somalia. They’ve escaped war, poverty and persecution, but the chances of becoming EU citizens are remote. They’re setting foot on a continent that can’t ignore them but doesn’t want them. My hope is Europe. What are you hoping for in Europe? Europe, Iwant Europe. What are you hoping for in Europe? Europe, I want to build my education. You want a good education? Yes. What else do you want? I’m a doctor. You’re a doctor? Yes, after I take my education, if Somalia becomes safe, I will go there. In all more than 400 arrive this day. You made it. They’re pretty happy. They’ve spent a lot of time in the water. They’ve spent a lot of money. They’ve taken huge risks and they’re finally here in Europe. Now what? They’re take ton several holding Seb -- Europe. Now what? They’re take ton several holding Seb -- taken to several holding centres across Italy. This one is a former NATO base built for 2,000 people, now overcrowded with more than 4,000 migrants. Life here can be rough, a breeding ground for drug abuse and prostitution. Those we spoke to didn’t want to appear on camera, fearful of local gang Lord’s. All complained about the time it takes to get their papers to be able to work, it can take years. The truth is this country cannot cope with the massive influx of migrants in recent months. So far this year, more than 50,000. The EU’s migrant policy is sadly a mess. Italy and Greece say it’s unfair that they should be shoaledering the burden of the crisisjust because migrants end up on their doorsteps first. The European Commission has responded, willing to bring in quotas for all 28 member states. Some, like the UK, say they’re not taking any migrants in. This human rights activist backs a quota system. TRANSLATION: Europe comes together to patrol its borders, why not come together to sort out this crisis? A common policy is needed to take the refugees in to secure their human rights. But many Europeans struggling in economies badly hit by recession don’t want a perceived flood of migrants. Europe’s leaders are caught between the hardening sentiment of voters, backed by populist political parties, and the desire to help people in need. But while the EU wrestles with what to do, and poverty blights countries, the migrants keep coming. It is clear Europe’s common policy to save migrants in the Mediterranean is working. just over there, that orange ship is a Norwegian rescue vessel. We know HMS Ball washing is in the area -- vessel. We know HMS Ball washing is in the area -- Balwark is in the Europe. Europe cannot agree on what to do once the migrants are plucked from the water. In the last few minutes we’ve heard from the Italian navy that in four separate operations, they’ve rescued 300 migrants, all from Sub-Saharan Africa. They will be joining their fellow countrymen and women here in Italy in the next few daysment -- days. Police in North Yorkshire are investigating, after video footage showed 16 fox cubs being held in a barn near hunt kennels. The images were filmed by the League Against Cruel Sports, who allege that the cubs were being raised to be hunted. Fox hunting with dogs was made illegal in 2004. The hunt says it’s assisting the police and is confident that no-one connected with the hunt has committed any offence. Here’s our rural affairs correspondent, Claire Marshall. This is the moment 16 fox cubs are discovered in a Baranau. It’s the first time the footage has been shown and shortly after it was taken, North Yorkshire Police raided the Baranau and took away the cubs. The police say the young foxes were at least four different vixens. The barn where they were found is some 200 metres from the kennels of the local hunts. This footage shows 16 fox cubs being kept in a barn without sign of a vixen or parents. We believe that they’re being kept to ensure there are plenty of foxes to Hunt this coming season, when they come out. We think this practice is widespread. It demonstrates that Hunting is nothing -- has nothing to do with fox control or wildlife management. It’s just a cruel sport that people take part in purely for pleasure. It’s been illegal to Hunt foxes with packs of dogs for over a decade. So when hunts meet riders follow fake scent trails, known as drag Hunting. However opponents claim that the law is regularly broken and that foxes are still being killed. The league claims it filmed a man with connections to the local Hunt at the barn where the cubs were kept. We’ve come to North Yorkshire to see for ourselves. This is the shed where the fox cubs were found. A short walk away are the kennels. The young cubs appear to have access to food and water. It’s not illegal to hold wild animals and we don’t know why they were being kept there. We talked to masters from the Hunt and they referred us to the Countryside Alliance who gave us this statement: The owners of the land say Beth areas are on a long-term lease and they don’t have any day-to-day involvement in tenanted areas of the estate. This was the strength of feeling against the Hunting Act, many see the ban as an attack on a way of life. Now the Prime Minister has pledged to have a free vote on it. The claims made today are likely to enrage those on both sides of the debate. We don’t know exactly what has happened. But I’ve never heard of this kind of incident before. So, we need to find out what’s happened. Certainly, actions like this would not be supported by the Hunting community. The cubs are now in a sanctuary in Liverpool, where we were allowed to film them. Vergely they’ll be released into the wild. A British backpacker has been arrested in Malaysia, after posing naked on a sacred mountain. 24-year-old Eleanor Hawkins was among a group who stripped off for a photograph on top of Mount Kinabalu, in Borneo. She’s yet to be charged, but a local minister has blamed the tourists’ behaviour and their disrespect to the sacred mountain for causing an earthquake in Malaysia six days later. From Kuala Lumpur, jennifer Pak reports. Standing on top of one of malaise was most sacred mountains, these backpackers thought they were being funny. Stripping off, then allegedly urinating on the place local people believe their ancestors’ spirits rest. Eleanor Hawkins is suspected to be one of ten foreigners who posed naked. The 23-year-old was detained as she tried to leave a local airport. detained as she tried to leave a localairport. Her local airport. Her father says Elinor is quite scared and upset. She knows what she did is stupid and disrespectful. She’s very sorry for the offence she has caused the Malaysian people. Two other Canadians and a Dutch national, turned themselves in. All four showed up to court in purple uniforms and seemed stunned they are being held for public indecency. TRANSLATION: Undersection being held for public indecency. TRANSLATION: Under section 294 A of the penal code the penalty is a fine or a prison sentence of three months or both. Mount Kinabalu is considered sacred by local tribes. Many believe the mountain is the final resting spot for the souls of the dead. Disrespecting this belief will lead to accidents. In this case an earthquake struck days after the stunt, killing 18 people, including school children. The regional deputy chief minister says the quake confirmed that the actions of these tourists caused the spirit of the mountain to be angry. But out here on the streets, across Malaysia, not everybody agrees with him. The earthquake has nothing to do with the stripping. It’s not because of the action of the tourists, but it’s because of the geography issue that caused the earthquake. What do you think of the actions of the tourists and the amount of anger levelled at them? They should respect our culture. Many have called for the tourists to be punished. The lawyer for Elinor and the three other tourists have requested that the foreigners be held separately from other prisoners for their own safety. Prince Harry has unveiled a memorial to those who lost their lives during the war in Afghanistan. The Bastion Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum, in Staffordshire, displays the names of all 453 British personnel who died in the Afghan conflict. Caroline Wyatt reports. jackie Thompson Cherishes the memory of her husband Gary. 51 and a father of five when he was killed serving in Helmand province. His name, one of the many engraved forever on a Memorial Wall. When I heard that Gary had been killed, and obviously I wasn’t there for his last moments, that makes it incredibly hard. You think that nobody would be able to look after him or care for him the same as you would. Then I heard about the pastion wall, what the -- Bastion Wall and that eased my anxieties. I thought, Bastion Wall and that eased my anxieties. Ithought, he’s in Bastion Wall and that eased my anxieties. I thought, he’s in good hands. They care about him. Today she joined the many military families who lost a husband, father or son. Everyone who has lost a loved one or seen them changed by their experiences will feel a different emotion - their experiences will feel a different emotion - grief, sorrow, loss, anger, or regret for that left unsaid. just as each of those named on the wall behind me was unique. William Aldrich was the youngest soldier to William Aldrich was the youngest soldierto die, soldier to die, just 18 when killed by a Taliban bomb. It’s extremely poignant. It’s very emotional because to me it’s partly about the finality of the war in affection and our troops being there, being over, but it’s also important that part of Afghanistan and the memory of our loved ones has come home to the UK. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Sarah Keith-Lucas. We’ve had strong june sunshine today. As we can see from this photo sent in, blue skies and in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales today it’s been the warmest day of the year so far. We’ve also got very high levels of pollen at the moment. If you’re a hay fever sufferer you’ll have noticed that. That high pollen stays around tomorrow. We end today on a dry note with late sunshine. Then our attention turns to a break down in the dry weather we have seen. We will see heavy and thundery showers pouring in from the south-west overnight. By the time of the early hours Friday most places dry and settled with sunshine from the word go. The showers in the south could be heavy, thundery. We have had thunder storms across the channel aisles. Tomorrow morning, the heavier showers spread across southern counties. Thunder and hail mixed in as well. To the north of that, most places fine and dry, similar to today. Temperatures 20 to 25 degrees widely. Could be warmer in one or two places. It’s humid and sticky and we’ll see heavy down pours across southern areas into the evening. It could be quite a wet Friday evening rush hour. Needless to say, with torrential down pours, enough rain to cause some surface water flooding, for instance on the roads and motorways. Keep tuned to BBC local radio station in terms of any travel disruption. Into Saturday, we still have a fairly slow-moving band of rain through central England and Wales. Brightening up to the south. One or two showers to the north. Temperatures fresher compared to Friday. Highs of around 17 to 21 in the south. Further north, some places atjust 11 or 12. We have thundery showers tomorrow, during the weekend turning cooler. But at least those pollen levels will be on the way down. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the On the programme tonight, a special report: The self-styled reverend selling bleach as a miracle cure for serious illnesses. There is no evidence it is helpful, there is evidence it is dangerous. It’s feared the potentially lethal substance will be promoted to vulnerable people in Surrey. Also tonight: A teenager’s stabbed to death near a playground in Islington. Witnesses say he was attacked with a machete. A VOUFIQ WOITIBFI is jailed for sending thousands of tweets encouraging terrorism. Plus, how the Duchess of Cornwall has helped bring the countryside to the inner city. Welcome to BBC London News with me Riz Lateef. First tonight a special report. There are fears that a potentially lethal substance, marketed as a miracle cure for serious illnesses, will be targeted ",,
57,BBC1 London,11-jun-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"On my sofa this week, music from Cyndi Lauper, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, and he’s back, it’s my favourite actor, Mark Wahlberg! Tonight at Ten: The powers of the police and security services to carry out electronic surveillance need to be completely rewritten. An official report says a detailed case needs to be made before the capture of people’s communications data is widened. What it’s all about, from my point of view, is putting all those powers together into one place, one act of Parliament, which can be properly debated, easily understood, and which applies proper safeguards. The report also says that judges, not ministers, should sign the warrants allowing communications to be intercepted. We’ll have the details. Also tonight: A teacher in Bradford is stabbed in front of pupils - police have arrested a 14 year-old boy. Andreas Lubitz, the pilot who crashed his German passenger plane in the Alps, had visited A1 doctors over a period of five years. Prince Harry dedicates the memorial wall to 453 servicemen and women who died in Afghanistan. And the veteran actor, Sir Christopher Lee, whose famous roles included Count Dracula, has died at the age of 93. Tonight on BBC London. A special report on a Reverend selling ‘bleach’ as a miracle cure for serious illnesses. And a young woman isjailed for sending thousands of tweets encouraging men, women and children into terrorism. Good evening. A new start is needed on the laws that cover the power of the police and security services to monitor communications. David Anderson the independent reviewer of anti-terror legislation has published a major report recommending 'comprehensive and comprehensible’ rules on the powers available. He wants a newjudicial body not ministers to authorise the interception of phone calls and emails. The government is to publish draft legislation in the autumn. But critics say the proposals would amount to a serious infringement of privacy. Our Security Correspondent Gordon Corera has more details. A British terrorist who fought in Iraq and Syria. A gang smuggling millions of pounds worth of heroin. A taxi driver murdered at a Derbyshire railway station - in each case those responsible were convicted because the State could gather evidence from the internet and mobile phones. But do the police and spies have too little or too much power to listen in? Today’s report, by an independent lawyer appointed by the Prime Minister, says although the current range of powers is about right, crucially, the law governing them needs a radical overhaul. We got a lot of powers already. They are very strong powers, a lot of them are very necessary powers. The problem is that they are scattered all over the place. There are more than 65 different Acts of Parliament and the protection that is given to innocent people when those powers are excercised are highly variable. 50 years ago intercepting someone’s communications was relatively straightforward, all you had to do was come to a telephone exchange like this and put crocodile clips on a phone line to listen in. But since then, technology has changed. Communicating over the internet means more and more data is now held not in Britain but abroad, especially in the US. That’s led to tensions, for instance in the case of the murder of Lee Rigby. With accusations that companies like Facebook could have done more to help in monitoring the messages of the killers. Last year there were nearly 2,800 warrants to intercept the content of communications, each signed by a minister and more than half a million requests for data about communications, for instance, who called who but not what they said. These are often made and authorised by the police. Today’s report calls for increased scrutiny by having judges, not politicians, sign off intercept warrants and sensitive cases. That may make it easier for foreign companies to help and it’s been welcomed by one journalist who had his phone records secretly taken to find his resources. It is crucial that the government listen and act in a lot of these things, putting the powers in the hands ofjudges, away from the police officers, often quite junior police officers, if they do things will change but we really do hope that the Home Secretary will listen to this. One former intelligence chief backs the report. But does caution of the risks ofjudges approving some cases. just imagine that you have a sensitive overseas intelligence operation, perfectly lawfully put forward, a judge therefore approves it. If it goes wrong, the political risk would fall on the Foreign Secretary - who wouldn’t have been involved in the approval. That concern over losing control may be why some ministers are thought to be unsure about agreeing to all of the changes outlined today. But the Government has confirmed that a new law is coming. We need to ensure as the criminals change the way that they communicate that we update the legislation and ensure that our security agencies and police have the powers that they need. After years of fractious debate on security and privacy, today’s report may offer a route forward on how much the state should be able to listen in. Live to Westminster and james Landale is there. What are the next steps, likely, james? What the Government is to do is to take the report, have a think, publish draft legislation in the autumn, a proper bill in the spring which the Government hopes to get through Parliament by the end of next year. MPs gave this warm welcome, all sides agreeing it must be tidied up. But I don’t think there will be consensus over all of the details. I think that there will be disagreement over the idea of giving judges the power to authorise the enterceptions, the Government have been cool about that today. Also disagreements over the idea of forcing communications companies to keep all of that data, to let the agencies get access to it, what people call snooper’s charter. Today the Government appears keen for that, David Anderson was cool about it. So, Theresa May, will have to walk a fine line on this. If she in any way seems to be ignoring what David Anderson says INAUDIBLE Well, james, I am sorry to interrupt you, clearly there are problems with the sound in the microphone but we got the gust gives of what he was saying there. Police in West Yorkshire have arrested a 14-year-old boy, after a teacher was stabbed at a school in Bradford. The boy is being held on suspicion of attempted murder. The 50-year-old teacher Vincent Uzomah who’s 50 is in a stable condition in hospital. It’s understood he’s a supply teacher at Dixons Kings Academy. Let’sjoin our correspondent judith Moritz at the school. It isa It is a little over a year since the teacher, Ann Maguire was stabbed to death, a little over a mile from here. Tonight this is the second school in the west of Yorkshire to find itself under a similar spotlight, its community coping with the aftermath of a class room stabbing. In Bradford city centre armed police swoop on a teenager accused of attempted murder. This video posted on social media tonight is said to be of the arrest. It came after a day that shattered Dixons Kings Academy, lessons were running as usual but there was no normality and the heavy police presence, with officers around the building. A science lesson had been about to start when a 14-year-old pupil stabbed his teacher in the stomach. It happened in a classroom whilst other children watched. Yeah, I saw what happened. Hejust stabbed him and run off. A really nice teacher. A polite teacher. He never shouted and that’s it. The teacher, is understood only to have been working at the school for a few weeks. He is now stable in hospital. His injuries not said to be life threatening. The police said they were looking for the 14-year-old student who fled from the school after the stabbing. As the news spread parents started to arrive at the school gates. The school rang me. Your son saw it happen. He is OK. You were able to speak to him yourself? Yes, he is OK. I have been speaking to him. For the last half an hour I was trying to ring them but no-one replied on the school phone. That is why I am worried about my daughter. The school stayed open with extra support for pupils and the police talking to the children who saw what happened. All the students are safe and calm and have responded with tremendous maturity during a difficult time for the school. The police are looking for the lead up to the incident. There was nothing in school that led UP There was nothing in school that led up to it, there may be other people who knew something. Late this afternoon the police confirmed that they had found a 14-year-old pupil in the centre of Bradford. Recently we arrested a I4-year-old male in connection with the offence and in custody on suspicion of attempted murder. As the school day ended some parents came to walk their children away from the building. Tonight their teacher is still being treated in hospital, his family by his side. A mother, who’s gone on the run with her youn son after losing a custody battle, has been urged to return home. Rebecca and Ethan Minnock left their home in Somerset more than a fortnight ago. She’s let it be known in a newspaper interview they are both safe. Our correspondent jon Kay has the latest. New pictures released tonight of Ethan Williams. The little boy has now been missing for more than a fortnight, with his mother, 35-year-old, Rebecca Minnock. They disappeared on the day that a judge said Ethan must live with his father. Miss Minnock has phoned a national newspaper to say that she and her little boy are fine. I know I’m going to be in a huge, huge amount of trouble. It has even gotten family members in trouble. But it is my son. I have to put him first over myself, or anybody else. Rebecca Minnock was last seen at this supermarket, near her home in Somerset, getting money from a Cashpoint. Today a family friend was brought to Bristol Crown Court to answer questions about the mother and son’s disappearance. That friend was a 56-year-old lorry driver called Andrew Butt. The judge here said that he believed that Mr Butt had driven Rebecca and Ethan to Cheltenham on the day that they disappeared and that he then told a string of lies to the authorities to keep their whereabouts a secret. The judge found that Andrew Butt has committed a contempt of court. As a result he will spend the night in custody and will be sentenced tomorrow. The court heard he told a police officer that he would rather do ten years than tell the authorities where Rebecca is. Her mother was also in court for the hearing. She insists she doesn’t know where her daughter is hiding. What do you say to Rebecca? We love her. ""We love her"", the reply. Ethan’s father, Roger Williams has issued a statement saying: This is a very difficult time. And that the safe return of his only child is his priority. In France, the prosecutor, investigating the German air crash in the Alps in March, has revealed more details about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot, believed to have caused the crash. Some doctors had apparently felt he was unfit to fly but didn’t pass on the information because of German laws on patient confidentiality. All 150 people on board the Germanwings flight lost their lives in the crash. Our correspondent, Lucy Williamson, is in Paris. Lucy, what else has the prosecutor been saying? The most striking thing to come from the investigation is the gap between what Andreas Lubitz’s doctors knew and what the employers were aware of. This is a young pilot, who in the month leading up to the crash, saw doctors no less than seven times, some psychiatrists. He complained about eyesight problems, seeing flashes and a week or so before the crash told a doctor he was only getting two hours’ of sleep a night and worried he would go blind. The chief investigators said in France that some of the doctors thought him unfit to fly but did not pass on the information to employers as they were worried for being prosecuted for breaching doctor/patient confidentiality. We have been told a fresh team of investigators in France are looking at grounds if there are manslaughter charges to be brought against either companies or individuals. The most senior Chinese politician to be put on trial for corruption has been given a life sentence by the Supreme People’s Court. Zhou Yongkang was the former head of state security and one of the most powerful men in China. In court he admitted taking more than $20 million in bribes. His wife and son also accepted a similar sum in cash and property, as our China editor, Carrie Gracie, reports. The most sensational corruption trial in China’s history. Cameras in court only for a predictable verdict. Guilty on all charges. Every word carefully scripted in advance. TRANSLATION: I realise the harm I have caused to the party and the people. I’m guilty and I regret the crimes. Zhou Yongkang once seemed untouchable, one of nine men at the top of the Communist Party. There’s no stopping outside China’s ministry of state security. Zhou built an Orwellian empire of police, prisons and courts. Now he’s the victim of the police state within a state that he once ran. Zhou Yongkang is charged with taking bribes and abuse of power. He used the secrecy of the one-party state to become fabulously wealthy. But it’s politics, not corruption which has brought him down, through his control of China’s massive surveillance network, he plotted against rival leaders. Personal surveillance against the surveillance state. This is an investigative journalist who faced threats of kidnapping and violence. He says Zhou Yongkang lost out in a ruthless power struggle. TRANSLATION: Zhou Yongkang wanted to prevent Xi jinping from coming to poWâI’. He had plans to bring him down. Zhou wanted to be the power behind the throne and put his own man at the very top of the Communist Party. President Xi, the man who destroyed Zhou Yongkang, it’s impossible to know for sure what their fight was about. One will spend his life in prison and the other has become the most powerful leader in a generation. The presidential set menu has become legend at this Beijing restaurant. He came without his entourage and paid for his own lunch to make a point about simple living, enlisting the public against his enemies. TRANSLATION: The president’s going after the corrupt officials from top to bottom. We, ordinary people support him, endorse him. We love him. TRANSLATION: This case is hugely important. He did very evil things, worse than we have ever seen before. A new dawn at the heart of Chinese power, the president wants a Communist Party returning to its values. Zhou Yongkang talked the same language. Now he’s in prison for corruption. The moral that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Carrie Gracie, BBC News Beijing. Tens of thousands of migrants, having survived the crossing from north Africa to Sicily, have been heading through Italy towards northern Europe in search of a better life. Officials in the city of Milan say that more than 64,000 migrants have passed through the main railway station in the past 18 months. Italy’s calling for the rest of the EU to do more to help with the crisis. Let’sjoin Clive Myrie in the port of Catania in Sicily. You only need to go to the main bus station here to see in action the flow of migrants north, most don’t want to hang around southern Italy. Indeed southern Europe, because it’s economically depressed compared to the north. So the bus route from here to Rome, then onto Milan is popular, because that’s the gateway to the more prosperous economies of Germany and the UK. So what is the EU’s overall response to the migrant question? And how does it affect countries on the frontline, like Italy? We’ve been allowed on board an Italian coastguard ship. These passengers, plucked from the Mediterranean are now caught between two worlds. Where have you come from? Somalia. They’ve escaped war, poverty and persecution, but the chances of becoming EU citizens are remote. They’re setting foot on a continent that can’t ignore them but doesn’t want them. My hope is Europe. What are you hoping for in Europe? Europe, I want to build my education. You want a good education? Yes. What else do you want? I’m a doctor. You’re a doctor? Yes, after I take my education, if Somalia becomes safe, I will go there. In all, more than 400 arrive this day. You made it. They’re pretty happy. They’ve spent a lot of time in the water. They’ve spent a lot of money. They’ve taken huge risks and they’re finally here in Europe. Now what? They’re taken to several holding centres across Italy. This one is a former NATO base, built for 2,000 people, now overcrowded with more than 4,000 migrants. Life here can be rough, a breeding ground for drug abuse and prostitution. Those we spoke to didn’t want to appear on camera, fearful of local gang lord’s. All complained about the time it takes to get their papers to be able to work, it can take years. The truth is this country cannot cope with the massive influx of migrants in recent months. So far this year, more than 50,000. The EU’s migrant policy is sadly a mess. Italy and Greece say it’s unfair that they should be shouldering the burden of the crisisjust because migrants end up on their doorsteps first. The European Commission has responded, willing to bring in quotas for all 28 member states. Some, like the UK, say they’re not taking any migrants in. This human rights activist backs a quota system. TRANSLATION: Europe comes together to patrol its borders, why not come together to sort out this crisis? A common policy is needed to take the refugees in to secure their human rights. But many Europeans struggling in economies badly hit by recession don’t want a perceived flood of migrants. Europe’s leaders are caught between the hardening sentiment of voters, backed by populist political parties, and the desire to help people in need. But while the EU wrestles with what to do, and poverty blights countries, the migrants keep coming. It is clear Europe’s common policy to save migrants stranded in the Mediterranean is working. The number of people drowning at sea has been dramatically reduced, as the British along with the Norwegians, the Swedes, the Belgians and othersjoin the Italians and the Greeks in patrolling the Med. They’re united on what it do with the migrants at sea, cooperation runs out when they reach dry land. Back to you. Clive, again thanks very much. Prince Harry hasjoined the Prime Minister, the head of the armed forces, and the families and friends of military personnel, who lost their lives in Afghanistan, at a service of dedication for the Bastion Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. It bears the names of all 453 UK service personnel who died in Afghanistan. Our correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, was there. jackie Thompson cherishes the memory of her husband Gary, 51 and a father of five, when he was killed serving in Helmand province.

Everyone who has lost a loved one or seen them changed by their experiences all feel a difference emotion - grief, sorrow, loss, anger or regret for that left unsaid, just as each of those named on the wall behind me was unique. The Memorial Wall and the cross from Camp Bastion are a permanent reminder of the losses suffered in the 13 long years of war in Afghanistan and the 453 British servicemen and women who gave their lives for their country. William Aldridge was the youngest soldier to die, just 18 when he was killed by a Taliban bomb. It’s extremely poignant. It’s obviously very emotional because, for me, it’s partly about the finality of the war in Afghanistan and our troops being there being over. But it’s also important that part of Afghanistan and the memory of our loved ones has come home to the UK. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News, at the National Memorial Arboretum. An army officer, in charge of a military exercise in the Brecon Beacons, has told an inquest into the deaths of three soldiers that he hadn’t realised the 16-mile training march was taking place on the hottest day of the year. Lance Corporals Craig Roberts, Edward Maher and Corporaljames Dunsby collapsed with heatstroke in july 2013 and later died. A British backpacker, who’s been arrested in Malaysia for posing topless on a sacred mountain says she’s very sorry for causing offence. Timothy Hawkins said his 23-year-old daughter- one of ten trekkers who stripped off on the summit of Mount Kinabalu on Borneo - knew she’d been ""stupid and disrespectful"". Sir Christopher Lee, the veteran actor whose career spanned seven decades, has died at the age of 93. He made his name playing Count Dracula in the Hammer Horror productions but also appeared in the Bond franchise and more recently in The Lord of the Rings. Nick Higham looks back at his life. For years, Christopher Lee seemed to be in every British horror film. One part in particular he made his own - Dracula. The vampire, a sinister hero. A romantic, erotic, heroic, fascinating figure. Highly dangerous. Savage, but above all, which I think is the most important thing when you are playing characters of this kind, tormented, agonised, sad. What a ghastly fate - to be immortal. Christopher Lee was half English, half Italian. His mother was a Contessa. They said he was too tall and foreign-looking to become a film actor. That didn’t stop him. This was the first British horror film in colour. He disliked being type-cast. Hollywood offered a wider range of roles to sink his teeth into. As the james Bond villain, Scaramanga. My golden gun against your PPK. Each of us with a 50/50 chance. Six bullets to your one. I only need one. He made almost 300 screen appearances. His favourite this Pagan cult thriller. As so often, he combined an aristocratic manner with fiendish intent. So, you have come here for information. And then, late in life, he found a whole new audience as Saruman, in Lord Of The Rings and in the Star Wars movies as well. I have no use for your mercy. The film industry honoured him while he was still alive to enjoy it. I am thankful that I don’t follow in the steps of the great Stanley Kubrick, whose award was posthumous. He was an imposing actor and one who knew perfectly well why he was famous. He called his memoirs, Tall, Dark and Gruesome. The actor Christopher Lee - who’s died at the age of 93. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening. I’m Asad Ahmad. There are fears over a potentially lethal substance - marketed as a ‘miracle cure’ for serious illnesses - being targeted at vulnerable people in Surrey. A group known as the Genesis II Church is holding a secret seminar tomorrow - where it’ll discuss the use of what it calls - the ‘Miracle Mineral Solution’ - a liquid which is similar to industrial strength bleach. BBC London went undercover to buy the chemicals online and meet the man who sells them as a cure for everything from Autism to Aids. Katharine Carpenter reports. This man has come to King’s Cross station to mix us a chemical cocktail. A concoction, he claim, can rid people of debilitating conditions and life-threatening illnesses. This is Leanardo Edwards, this is who he sold us online. Potentially harmful ingredients to make up a solution. Those who claim it has health benefits, call it Kylie Minogue. But to you and me it is basicallyjust bleach. MMS is widely promoted by this group, for nonreligious -- promoted by this group, for nonreligious -- the nonreligious, Genesis Two Church.

If you look at the morning papers, they all have pictures of those people with masks on. So, concern, and that clip you played of the President, the code there, the subtext is that the system was not tight enough before, now we are tightening it. There is some criticism in the morning papers, saying I5 days since the first case emerged, why has more not been done? We are getting stories, for example, people with symptoms going to play golf. We had a guy going to China with the symptoms, and taking the illness there. There is a sense among the public and the papers that the quarantine system has not been tight, that needs to be tighter. Also, where will this thing stop? What you worry about with these things is that too becomes four, becomes eight, 16... The next thing you know, it is beyond control. Even as we speak, I had the figures a moment ago from Rico, they have gone up. 35 confirmed cases, a lot more schools closed today than yesterday. A sense that the authorities have not really got a grip on this thing. That is the thing, the president is obviously keen to let people know that they are taking all the measures they need to take. They haveit measures they need to take. They have it under control. Do people believe them? I don’t think so, really. One day, there will be a study made of the way South Korea has dealt with this thing. In the way of how you should and should not do things. One of the questions is how much knowledge you put out there. One of the government ‘s criticisms is that not enough knowledge has been put out there. In the absence of knowledge, people are making all sorts of assumptions. They are saying, falsely, that the strain has mutated. But the thing is out of control. So, the people certainly believe that not enough knowledge has come their way. There’s been an angry diplomatic exchange between China and the Philippines - triggered by the ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea. This latest spat began when Philippine President, Benigno Aquino made a veiled comparison between China’s land reclamation activities to Nazi Germany’s expansionism in the run up to the Second World War. He’s injapan where he’s expected to hold talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe focusing on defence and security ties. Here’s a little of what Mr Aquino had to say to the japanese Parliament. When America and japan talk about their concerns and when this is also seconded by the EU and other countries that have expressed concern, it reminds China of its diplomatic responsibility as a member of the international community. The commentators were saying, what if somebody had said stop to Hitler at that point in time or to Germany at that time? Could we have avoided World War II? You are watching Newsday on the BBC, live from Singapore and London. Still to come... Tiananmen Square protests reveal how watchers like these played a central role in Chinese modern history. -- these played a central role in Chinese modern history. -- watches. Now let’s have a look at all of the stories making headlines in newspapers around the world. The japan Times leads with the pension scandal gripping the government. It has details of how hackers sent a computer virus via e-mail and store details of more than 1 million people. The China daily reports on rising tension with the Philippines over the South China Sea.

Rescue teams have been cutting through the Hull of the Chinese cruise ship which capsized in the Yangtze River as they try to reach some of the hundreds of people thought to be inside. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provocative action after the worst day of violence in Ukraine for months. Moscow claimed the Ukrainian army had shelled civilian areas, whilst Kiev said pro-Russian rebels had launched a large-scale offensive. The fighting centred around the town of Mariinka, near the main crossing point into rebel territory. Tom Burridge reports from eastern Ukraine. On part of the front-line today it at least felt like the war was back on. GUNFIRE It sounded like it too. Even though the firing in eastern Ukraine has never really stopped, despite the supposed peace deal. It’s the heaviest fighting we have witnessed in several months. In a village, just back from the front-line, Sasha, Katya and their young daughter, Anya, take shelter under ground. 10-year-old Anya says she couldn’t go to school today because of the shelling. TRANSLATION: It’s so scary. I can’t bear to listen. I want it to finish soon. Her mother, Katya, tells us the family have nowhere else to go, so they’ll stay here until the bombs stop. Today fighting raged around Maryinka, a town next to the main check point to cross the front-line. This is a road we’ve travelled down dozens of times over the last few months. It’s a road that civilians use every day to go from government-controlled Ukraine into rebel-controlled territory to visit their relatives or to go to work, but within a matter of hours the dynamic, at least in this part of this region, has changed significantly. Who controls Maryinka tonight is unclear. Today’s fighting - filmed here by pro-Russian rebel troops, was concentrated in one place - but the fear is that things could escalate further and it will test the faith of leaders in European capitals to the West who are trying to negotiate with Russia for peace. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in eastern Ukraine. Hong Kong is gearing up to commemorate the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. It is the only city on Chinese soil where such a public event is allowed. In mainland China, activists have been moved or put under house arrest to prevent them from marking the date. This year, the candlelight vigil in Hong Kong has been touched by controversy. For the first time, a key pro-democracy group, the Hong Kong Federation of Students, will not be taking part. Let’s examine the background to the rift. I think the strong sense of rejection against China, advocated by these young people, they have the undesirable consequence of splitting the mainstream movement in Hong Kong for democracy. Because we all know thatitis for democracy. Because we all know that it is politically unrealistic for us to ignore China as a whole. The Chinese authorities ignored the international outcry following the crackdown and, instead, gave a specially commissioned watch to the soldiers and police who were deployed that day. One of the craftsmen who made them was Xu Yaonan. Here’s his story. TRANSLATION: When you look at a watch, every piece of it is dead and cold. But after being assembled by warm hands, everything comes to life. The Beijing watch factory was built by the state in 1958. It was the start of China’s watchmaking industry. Forthe the start of China’s watchmaking industry. For the first time, all the parts of our watches were made here is China. -- in China. ~ I was assigned to work here in 1962. When I first entered the factory, it was amazing to see all the brand-new machines and young workers. Everyone was so proud. Back then, people could only use coupons to buy a watch. It was among the three big items every family dreamt of owning. A watch, sewing machine and bicycle. The Swatch is special. -- A watch, sewing machine and bicycle. The Swatch is special. -- this watch. It was ordered by the Mayor of Beijing to commemorate the quelling of the Tiananmen Square riots in 1989. We made tens of thousands of them and they were sent to different army squads and police who had participated in the crackdown. We focused on making these watches really well. All slick and waterproof. It is one of our contributions to society. But we really can’t discuss it. It’s still sensitive. The Tiananmen incident still has a chilling effect when people talk about it. Many died there for the reason. -- people talk about it. Many died there for the reason. -- for no reason. This big order helped us through a difficult period of time. I watch production was hit badly by the new watches. We struggled for a very long time. Now I have retired. But I still live in the factory compound and help out. I want people in China to learn about us. And ourfirst-class watches, meet here in the Beijing watch factory. -- meet. Let’s update you now on Solar Impulse. The solar powered plane which is attempting to fly all the way round the world, albeit with a few stops on the way. The plane’s wings have been damaged by high winds while on the ground injapan. It had to make an unplanned stop there after flying into bad weather en route from China to Hawaii. It will take at least a week to repair the wings and the aircraft is -- to repair. Live anthrax was mistakenly sent to more than 50 laboratories across the United States and 3 other countries. That’s more than double the original estimate. The shipments, intended for research, were sent from a US military base over a ten year period. So far nobody has been infected. Ben Bland reports. Seen under a microscope it may look attractive, but this is anthrax and potentially deadly. Somehow live samples were mistakenly sent to laboratories across the US, as well as Canada, Australia and South Korea. The Pentagon insists there’s no risk to the public. We put it in a Ziploc bag and close it up, as another layer of corporate -- a Ziploc bag and close it up, as another layer of corporate -- of protection for anything that leaks.

They were sent from this army base in Utah over ten years. The virus, intended for research, should have been made in active before being sent. So was it a mistake or something more sinister? We will continue the investigation but as of this point there is absolutely nothing to indicate that this would be somebody who was trying to do this deliberately. At least 20 people have been treated as a precaution. 51 laps are known to have received the problem patches and that number could yet rise. -- batches.

The seemingly placid shark appears to be enjoying a scratch. Man’s new best friend. You have been watching Newsday, from Singapore and London. For many of us, today will be the warmest weather we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will be hotter still on Friday across eastern England with high levels of humidity, bringing a risk of thunderstorms. Thunderstorms already forming across Spain, and that will drift across France over the next 24 hours, the risk across on Friday. Overnight, turning chilly in rural areas with temperatures getting down to single figures, towns and cities relatively mild. Plenty of warm sunshine on Thursday, there could be an early morning isolated fog patch, but most will start off clear. We will keep the sunshine into the afternoon as well. A different story further north, Northern Ireland and Scotland will have more cloud than we had on Thursday, and that will be thick enough to give us a little bit of rain. In the sunshine further south, temperatures will be soaring, 23 or maybe 24 somewhere across London or south-east England and East Anglia. That’s where the real warmth is on Thursday afternoon. Heading into Friday, heat and humidity will build, feeling a little oppressive for some. Temperatures will reach 25 or 26 degrees in the warmest areas. With the heat comes humidity. That combination of heat and humidity is likely to spark some thunderstorms, particularly across parts of eastern England. Storms arriving early in the day may not have too much in the way of heavy rain, but they could have big drops and lots of thunder and lightning. Storms later in the afternoon could be heavy indeed. just to the west of this line of thunderstorms, a slice of dry and brighter weather, still perhaps feeling a little on the humid side. Across south-west England and Wales, into north-west England and Scotland, this is where there will be a cold front, bringing outbreaks of rain. Behind the cold front, skies will brighten up.

Now on BBC News, all the latest business news live from Singapore. Chinese tech giants show shareholders are looking to raise $2 billion. In the Hong Kong stock exchange. We will take a look at the mounting pressure on companies accused of not paying theirfair pressure on companies accused of not paying their fair share of taxes around the world. Welcome to Asia Business Report. The largest shareholder in technology giants Lenovo is expected to get the green light for an initial public offering in Hong Kong today. It is a Chinese conglomerate called legend Holdings, and is looking to raise as much as 2 billion US dollars from investors. They are not the argument-- billion US dollars from investors. They are not the argument -- they are not the only one. More than 20 companies are looking to get games in the markets. I spoke to our guest earlier. -- games. We know that China has one of the highest levels of corporate debt in the world. Chinese companies are increasingly tapping on equity markets -- increasingly tapping on equity markets -- gains. Looking at increasing growth. They are taking advantage of the current boom market to do so, as the appetite for new listings remain strong. 23 initial public offerings over a span of five days. Won’t this take out the excitement, take the excitement out of the IPO markets? As I mentioned, the appetite remains strong. In Chinese bank accounts, we have $1 trillion worth of money sitting there doing nothing. That is $700 billion worth of liquidity, that will be taken out due to the initial public offerings. Would you advise investors to describe all of these IPOs? I would advise to -- investors to describe all of these IPOs? I would advise to -- investors to do that with due diligence. Recently, we have seen newly issued stocks have surged during recent trading. One of the reasons is that the companies are asking them not to sell at high valuations. It seems the momentum from the Chang-- Shanghai China stocks are still there? Yes, it is helping to increase the foreign participation in Chinese markets. If you compare Hong Kong and Singapore, taking a look at them numbers, Singapore had three public offerings so far this year. Why is it left behind? Why on the Chinese company is looking at Singapore, who want to be a IPO hub as well? One of the reasons it is active in this part of the world, the Southeast Asia region, it has tapered off recently. Naturally Singapore is affected by the lack of IPO activity in the region. Do you think though that there is a bubble that is about to burst with so many IPOs, and this continuing, despite a slowing global economy? We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of correction courses by analysts, but the markets do not sit -- do not think it will end soon. In mY -- do not think it will end soon. In my view, there is upside potential to go. Asia’s biggest technology show is taking place in Taipei this week, with 350 Chinese companies putting their goods on display. China has long been a business of offering cheap copycat versions of other brands. As our correspondent reports, the drive for innovation is beginning to produce recruit-- results. Le novo Lenovo is one of the companies --. This is one of the companies that has become one of the world ‘s biggest brands in such a short time. They are posing a challenge to the global giants like Apple and Samsung. Other Chinese companies are accused of being copycats, producing cheaper products that imitate others. Some companies are trying to change that. This company won one of five gold awards at the fair for the product that connects different devices in the home of users mobile phones and to the Internet. That is not a small accomplishment. It was founded on just six That is not a small accomplishment. It was founded onjust six US -- 6000 US dollars. TRANSLATION: I think we should not just imitate others, we can look at what others are doing. But, we should know what our direction is, and what kind of customers we have and go down our own path. Industry experts say that they are seeing a change in the mindset among Chinese companies. Definitely not about copying anything any more. I would say Chinese companies definitely became much more competitive than ten years ago. They have a clear awareness that the next step for them to take is branding. This cannot be based on copying any more. Everyone knows that. Especially the Chinese know it. The market at home is very competitive. That is making Chinese companies strive to stand out. Analysts say they have come up with Mike Rowe, if not revolutionary, innovations to win over consumers. This company is the first to connect homes -- win over consumers. This company is the first to connect homes -- phones to home appliances. Samsung and Apple were still using plastic while this company was using metal. This year, Chinese companies make up the biggest group of overseas exhibitors, they have an increasingly big presence at technology shows around the world. But it is clear, in order for more of China’s high-tech brands to become global household names, they need to compete not only on lower prices, but in innovative design and high quality. At the world economic Forum in Cape Town, South Africa, the BBC caught UP Town, South Africa, the BBC caught up with a senior vice president, who described how the company he owns was leading the Chinese efforts to crack technology ingenuity. Actually, our company is one of the most innovative in the world. We have 170,000 people, how many of them are engaging? 45%. More than 75% of them are engaging in research and development. We have almost 50,000 patents filed. In other business is making headlines, the South Korean economy grew by .8% in the january to March period. That’s compared to the previous three months, in line with expectations. GDP data just shows that from one year earlier, the fourth-largest economy in age -- Asia expanded by 2.5%. Delhi has become the latest Indian state to ban the sale of produced by Maggi after tests showed they produced -- Maggi after tests showed they produced -- they have high levels of lead. Shares in Nestle have fallen by 10% since high levels of lead were first reported last month. Companies invading or aggressively avoiding paying their fair share of tax around the world are coming under increasing pressure. In this region, Australia will double the maximum penalties from next month, but will political and public pressure change the behaviour of those companies and their advisers. Our correspondent put that question to PWC. I think you can put -- track changes back to the economic crisis. That is when I saw a change in public attitude towards tax, it became topical. Within companies, you see a tremendous effort to comply with the law and do things that are legal. They spend a lot of money on compliance. What has changed that I have seen is that tax has become a board level issue, and they aren’t only thinking, is what we do legal? It is. But what would it mean to other reputation? Is it fair that they have to pay more tax, because they weren’t doing anything illegal? As a tax person who has grown up learning the rules and applying them, of course not. But it is the reality. What we really have to focus on is the laws that are being applied to today’s commerce and global economy are pretty badly out of date. They were built to deal with the goods economy of the 1960s or 70s. Now, they are dealing with an intangible economy, with applications, the Internet, those things. It is difficult to determine where income should be taxed under that kind of a construct. What is your advice now? Are you telling them to stop avoidance measures altogether? Professionally, we tried to tell our clients any options we think are in the law, but provide them with guidance and discuss with them the reputational issues. We say, look, these are the options available... But these are the three that appear to fit your corporate ethics and style. And your corporate intent on reputation. These are the two might not. .. reputation. These are the two might not... May -- reputation. These are the two might not... May -- while they may be legal, we don’t recommend them. We think you should think carefully. Let’s have a quick look at the markets. So far we are seeing a shipbreaking in and losing on early Thursday trade. US equities rose overnight. Helped by optimism that Greece is close to an agreement to avoid default. We are seeing encouraging job numbers in the private sector of America. Those are the markets. Thank you for investing your time with us. See you in the next hour of Asia Business Report. The top stories this hour...

Rescue teams have been cutting through the Hull of the Chinese cruise ship that capsized on the Yangtze River to find survivors. So far, 14 people have been rescued. Alton Towers theme park, in Staffordshire, is to remain closed for a second day, as health and safety officials continue their investigation into a crash on a roller-coaster yesterday. 18-year-old studentjoe Pugh and 17-year-old Leah Washington were sitting in the front row of the rollercoaster when the ride went horribly wrong. They are among the four left seriously injured in yesterday’s crash. A carriage full of passengers collided with an empty car, and it took almost five hours for the injured to be freed. We saw he would be put on a stretcher. A good sign is that he was sat up. You pray that he is a cave. We send our best wishes to his family. Today, all of the rides on the 18 pill Ian Today all carriages on the £18 million attraction the Smiler have been grounded and Alton Towers closed to all visitors. This is how the ride looked when emergency services rushed to the scene after two carriages collided and all rides on the attraction were grounded. Alton Towers closed following yesterday’s rescue operation led by experienced paramedic, Peter Howell. It was like a road traffic accident that had taken place at 25 feet in the air. We had two young men with head injuries and two young women with very severe leg injuries. It is very difficult to actually deal with. This mobile phone footage shows the momentsjust after the cars had collided. Everyone on the ride was screaming and we thought, well, that is what you do on a rollercoaster. But then we all realise they were not screaming because they were having fun, they were in an immense amount of pain. Bell-- they were distressed and terrified. So, what went wrong? Witnesses saw the carriages collide at the top of a loop. They heard a loud bang. The Smiler has a top speed of 53 mph. Alton Towers said today the car was actually travelling at 20 mph. Safety provisions should have prevented the two cars from ever being on the same piece of track but that did not happen. These pictures show how the two cars, now locked together, continued to move at a pace following impact. Passengers were swung around the loop a number of times until the car came to a halt at the bottom of the rollercoaster. The owners of the theme park have been working with members of the Health and Safety Executive to try to find out why it did happen. Our hearts are still with the people who were injured. It is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of this park. Alton Towers remains closed tomorrow while investigators look at whether technical issue or human error was to blame. Time now for all the sports news in Sport Today. Hello. This is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up on this programme: Former Fifa executive committee member Chuck Blazer admits accepting bribes for two World Cups, amongst other events. ""I’m beyond reproach"": The words of Fifa secretary generaljerome Valcke over a $10 million payment in relation to the staging of the 2010 World Cup. And Australia on top against the West Indies into minicar. -- And Australia on top against the West Indies into minicar. -- in the cricket. Hello and welcome to the programme. We start with the news coming out of New York, where documents shown before a federaljudge show that former Fifa executive committee member Chuck Blazer has admitted that bribes were commonplace in football. The 70-year-old says in the documents tendered in November of 2013 that he and others agreed to accept bribes for the hosting rights to the 1998 World Cup held in France and the 2010 tournament held in South Africa, as well as CONCACAF affiliated Gold Cups where he was general secretary in the region. Nick Bryant has more. These are the winning bids that are now part of the FBI’s global dragnet. The US authorities revealing this evening that they’re now looking into how Fifa awarded the World Cup to Russia and Qatar. But a figure at the heart of the investigation is an American, Chuck Blazer, who was not just a Fifa power broker, but one of its biggest cheerleaders. I think that Fifa’s doing a really excellentjob of promoting football around the world. If I look back ten years, 20 years and see the progress we made, I’m very proud of our accomplishments. But for the past three years this businessman, with a love of parrots, has been singing like a canary. Telling the US authorities what he knows about alleged corruption at the highest levels of the game and acting as an FBI informant who used a microphone, hidden in a key chain, to secretly record meetings. Nate Vinton is the New York journalist who broke the Chuck Blazer story. The IRS and the FBI and agent from each agency found him on a street in New York and told him that they could put him in handcuffs right there on-the-spot or he could co-operate with their probe. This evening came the release of court documents detailing his guilty plea in 2013. In them, Blazer says he and others on the Fifa Executive Committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with a selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup. He also admitted organising a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup, which ended up being held in France. Hisjet setting lifestyle included this flight with Nelson Mandela. In his online blog, Travels with Chuck Blazer and friends, reads like a cross between a sticker album featuring all-time greats and the celebrity magazine Hello!. During their meeting at the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin told him he looked like Karl Marx, but a former colleague, Mel Brennan, who has been -- Karl Marx. Chuck Blazer spent his millions from racketeering, money laundering and tax evasion, notjust on one luxury apartment in the exclusive Trump Tower in New York, but two. The second for the use of his cats. That one alone costs £4,000 a month. Presidents, Princes, even Popes, Chuck Blazer has met them all, but it’s his relationship with this man, Sepp Blatter, that will now come under scrutiny. Meanwhile, Fifa Secretary General jerome Valcke has said that he is ""beyond reproach"" over his involvement with a $10 million payment involved in the securing of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Valcke said he wasn’t guilty of corrupt practice, despite being involved in a payment to disgraced former Fifa vice-president jack Warner during South Africa’s successful bid to stage the World Cup five years ago. Valcke, though, says he doesn’t feel guilty and believes he should continue in his post. Well, the Qatar foreign minister has reacted angrily to suggestions that the bid for their World Cup was flawed. The Qatar fire was the best Arabic file presented to the competition and by far was the best amongst the competitors. We are confident that there’s no wrongdoing whatsoever. What are these reports when they say corruption? They have to have paid? It is prejudice. They are making it up? Some entities, some countries, don’t like to see an Arab state in the Middle East hosting a tournament as such for the Arab world. Qatar, when we started this did, we didn’t take it up on our shoulders for Qatar, we took it for the whole Middle East. The Arab Islamic state deserves to have such a competition. But rest assured that a time will come where we will show whoever works against Qatar in prejudice... We have all the evidence, we have all the files. Whoever worked against us, wherever it is an entity, a country outside the region, in the region, a day will come where we will show to the public what’s happened for this tournament. The French Open burst to life on Wednesday with defending men’s champion Rafael Nadal beaten in straight sets by world number one Novak Djokovic. Djokovic will go on to face Andy Murray after he beat David Ferrer. The evidence from the European clay-court season so far was that Novak Djokovic would be too strong for Rafael Nadal, despite his extraordinary record at Roland Garros, and Andy Murray would have to much for David Ferrer. But despite their previous meetings. So that I Djokovic won the first four games. What a reply by Rafael Nadal, but as soon as Novak Djokovic took the first set he looked comfortable. That fearsome Rafael Nadal forehand again looked brittle under the most fearsome scrutiny. Andy Murray could have won in straight sets but you can never write off David Ferrer. He returned very well for most of the match. Really important for Andy Murray to stamp his authority on the match. Not used to much energy to take the fourth set by six -1 games. Novak Djokovic has beaten Andy Murray in their last seven meetings. Ari has admitted him since the Wimbledon final of 2013 and history is changing.-- Wimbledon final of 2013 and history is changing. -- Andy Murray. It is no longer Rafael Nadal, but Novak Djokovic remains the ultimate test and that includes here at Roland Garros. It isn’t easy to sometimes execute the plan that you prepared before the match. But I managed to do that, had a very strong start, except in the second part of the first set and the first part of the second, the entire match went really well for me. Yes, it’s a definite big win. In the women’s draw, Serena Williams remains on course for a third French Open title. She thrashed Sara Errani in straight sets. The 33-year-old American is also chasing her 20th grand slam and has lost just once this season while winning 30 times. It is pretty awesome for me. I haven’t had a great clay-court season, so I am pretty excited to have gotten this far and hopefully I can keep going. Nothing is guaranteed, butjust at can keep going. Nothing is guaranteed, but just at this guaranteed, butjust at this point I am fighting tojust guaranteed, butjust at this point I am fighting to just stay in the tournament. Williams will now face Switzerland’s Timea Bacsinszky in the final four, after she beat Belgium’s Alison van Uytvanck. Either 2008 champion Ana Ivanovic or Czech Lucie Safarova await in Saturday’s final. To cricket and Australia have closed on 85-3 after day one of the opening Test against the West Indies in Dominica. The hosts won the toss and elected to bat but were dismissed inside 54 overs forjust 148, withjosh Hazelwood and Mitchell Starc both taking three wickets. Australia produced a disciplined performance with the ball and were at times spectacular in the field, prompting a West Indies’ collapse either side of lunch, with five middle-order wickets being lost forjust 28 runs. In response Steve Smith was unbeaten on 17 with debutant Adam Voges on 20 not out, but despite this lofty Michael Clarke shot he lost his wicket shortly after for just 18 runs to leave the match delicately poised heading into day two. One of the longest winless streaks in cricket has finally come to an end, with Leicestershire winning an English County Championship match for the first time in three years. They beat Essex by six wickets at Chelmsford on Wednesday, to end a run dating back 933 days, to the delight of BBC Radio Leicester commentator Richard Ray. He goes in. He is going to get a run! He got the run! Leicestershire have one! I will say that again, Leicestershire have one for the first time in the County Championship since September 2012. -- have won. The last couple of years have been hard to take because Leicestershire in the city and towns and villages... Far beyond, they are all smiling now. Fantastic.

He also admitted organising a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup, which ended up being held in France. Hisjet-setting lifestyle included this flight with Nelson Mandela. His online blog - Travels with Chuck Blazer and Friends - reads like a cross between a Panini sticker album featuring all-time greats and the celebrity magazine Hello!. During their meeting at the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin told him he looked like Karl Marx but a former colleague, Mel Brennan, who has been watching this saga closely, says he was a fraudulent capitalist. Chuck was corrupt from the get go. There wasn’t a single relationship that he had in world football that wasn’t about garnering silent wealth onto him self and wasn’t about, as a result, jeopardising the sport’s ability to take care of the most vulnerable. Chuck Blazer spent his millions from racketeering, money laundering and tax evasion notjust on one luxury apartment in the exclusive Trump Tower in New York, but two - the second for the use of his cats. That one alone cost £4,000 a month. Presidents, princes, even popes - Chuck Blazer has met them all, but it’s his relationship with this man, Sepp Blatter, that will now come under scrutiny. Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York. Live now to Washington and our correspondent, Tom Bateman. What is the latest on what has come out from these court transcripts? It in the astonishing thing that we have had in the US tonight is going from a position where Chuck Blazer was widely reported to have turned informant, to have helped the FBI get to those other Fifa executives as you heard about in that package, to the release of this, a 40 page transcript in which Chuck Blazer admits his guilt, an astonishing array of crimes including racketeering, conspiracy, taking bribes racketeering, conspiracy, taking bribes and kickbacks, money laundering and tax evasion. And remember, this was going on over a period of 20 years when Chuck Blazer was at the heart of that organisation. He was helping to bring the popularity of soccer right home to the US and he saw, really, a transformation of that sport in the US. It is clear why Chuck Blazer is so important to the investigators. What next? The FBI says the investigation continues. Many eyes have now turned to set matter, the outgoing president of Fifa. -- Sepp Blatter. When the Attorney General in the US was asked last week whether Sepp Blatter was part of the investigation, she would not comment only to say that the investigation continues. It has now been widely reported that the scope of the investigation is expanding to take in Sepp Blatter and also to include in its sights the awarding of the World Cup in 2018 to Russia and in 2022 two Qatar. Officially on the record, the authorities are saying very little. However, as I say, it seems that investigation tonight is expanding its scope to take in those other tournaments. Thank you. It turns out live anthrax was mistakenly sent to 51 labs in 17 American states and three other countries. That’s more than double the original estimate. The shipments intended for research were sent from a US military base over a ten-year period. So far, nobody has been infected. Ben Bland reports. Seen under a microscope it may look attractive, but this is anthrax and potentially deadly. Somehow, live samples were mistakenly sent to laboratories across the US, as well as Canada, Australia and South Korea. The Pentagon insists there’s no risk to the public. We put it in a Ziploc bag and close it up as another layer of protection for anything that leaks. We provide absorbent material that would be just sufficient to capture the amount of liquid if it were all to leak out of the vial. Another seal to make sure nothing can leak. We put it in another box. They were sent from this army base in Utah over ten years. The virus, intended for research, should have been made inactive before being sent. So, was it a mistake or something more sinister? We will continue the investigation but as of this point there is absolutely nothing to indicate that this would be somebody who was trying to do this deliberately. At least 20 people have been treated as a precaution. 51 labs are known to have received the problem batches and that number could yet rise. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provocative action after the worst day of violence in Ukraine for months. Officials in Moscow claim the Ukrainian Army shelled civilian areas. In Kiev, they claim pro-Russian rebels launched a large-scale offensive. The fighting centred on the town of Marinka near the main crossing point into rebel territory. From eastern Ukraine, Tom Burridge. On part of the frontline today it at least felt like the war was back on. GUNFIRE. It sounded like it, too. Even though the firing in eastern Ukraine has never really stopped, despite the supposed peace deal. It’s the heaviest fighting we have witnessed in several months. And in a village, just back from the frontline, Sasha, Katya and their young daughter, Anya, take shelter under ground. Ten-year-old Anya says she couldn’t go to school today because of the shelling. TRANSLATION: It’s so scary. I can’t bear to listen. I want it to finish soon. Her mother, Katya, tells us the family have nowhere else to go, so they’ll stay here until the bombs stop. Today fighting raged around Marinka, a town next to the main check point to cross the frontline. This is a road we’ve travelled down dozens of times over the last few months. It’s a road that civilians use every day to go from government-controlled Ukraine into rebel-controlled territory to visit their relatives or to go to work, but within a matter of hours the dynamic at least in this part of this region has changed significantly. Who controls Marinka tonight is unclear. Today’s fighting, filmed here by pro-Russian rebel troops, was concentrated in one place but the fear is that things could escalate further and it will test the faith of leaders in European capitals to the west, who are trying to negotiate with Russia for peace. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in eastern Ukraine. One of the world’s best-known athletics coaches is at the centre of doping allegations following a BBC investigation. Among the claims is that Alberto Salazar was involved in doping Galen Rupp, the American long-distance runner. Both Rupp and Great Britain’s Mo Farah are part of Salazar’s training base in Oregon but there’s no suggestion that Mo Farah has broken any rules. The allegations come from a number of former athletes and staff. Alberto Salazar and Galen Rupp have strenuously denied any wrongdoing. The BBC’s Mark Daly has this exclusive report. This was the crowning moment for Alberto Salazar- his two biggest stars taking gold and silver at the London Olympics. A US athletics legend himself, Salazar is head coach at the prestigious Nike Oregon Project, home to Mo Farah since 2011. But now a number of former athletes and staff who worked with Salazar have made allegations to the BBC about unethical practices and the use of banned steroids. Steve Magness was Alberto Salazar’s assistant coach. In 2011, he says he saw a lab report from back in 2002 relating to US 10,000 metre record-holder Galen Rupp, and took a photo of it. It had ""currently on testosterone medication."" When I saw that, I kind ofjumped backwards a little, like - wait a minute, on testosterone medication? Testosterone...it’s obviously banned. I mean, I knew that, everybody knew that. In response, Alberto Salazar says the document is incorrect and says what had been recorded as testosterone medication, a banned anabolic steroid, was actually a legal nutritional supplement called Testo Boost. Both he and Galen Rupp strenuously denied Rupp had ever used testosterone. As part of a year-long investigation, I’ve heard a number of other allegations including that Salazar experimented with testosterone to see how much would trigger a positive drugs test, manipulated anti-doping rules on medical exemptions and encouraged prescription drug use to help performance and weight loss. Kara Goucher is probably the most famous female athlete in America. She and her husband Adam, both Olympians, were coached by Salazar for seven years. They told me they witnessed anti-doping violations as well as unethical behaviour by Salazar. He is sort of a win-at-all-costs person. It’s hurting the sport. You were very close to Alberto Salazar? Mm-hmm. How difficult has it been doing this interview today? It’s really hard. For years, he was a super important person in my life. I mean, I literally loved him. I loved him. He was like a father figure to me so it feels like a betrayal a little bit and I feel really bad about that but he put me in this position. I showed the allegations to David Howman, chief executive of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Are you disturbed by what I’ve told you? Totally. I mean, I would be not only disturbed, I would be very disappointed. And that’s why I think it needs to be scrutinised by us as an independent body. Alberto Salazar, who has been a consultant for UK Athletics for two years, told the BBC: Galen Rupp said: There is no suggestion that any other Oregan Project athletes, including Great Britain’s Mo Farah, have broken any anti-doping rules. But if the allegations about Alberto Salazar are true, then Mo Farah has been coached to world success by a man who has used banned methods. Mo Farah told the BBC that in his experience, Alberto Salazar and the Oregon Project always strictly followed WADA rules and that he himself had never used banned drugs. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: On the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, how watches like these played a central role in modern Chinese history. First, though, let’s round up the stories making newspaper headlines around the world. The japan Times leads again with the pension scandal gripping the government. The paper carries details of how hackers sent a computer virus via email. They were able to steal details from more than one million people. China Daily reports on the rising tension with the Philippines over the South China Sea. It describes the shock in Beijing at comments from the Philippines President comparing China to Nazi Germany. The Pentagon wants Congress to lift a ban on buying rockets from Russia, according to the International New York Times. It was introduced last year in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The paper quotes officials who say they need access to the equipment for a few more years. Finally, the Straits Times has a story on a new defence deal signed between India and the US. The ten-year agreement covers joint military exercises and maritime security. This is BBC News, I’m Mike Embley. The latest headlines: Chuck Blazer, FIFA’s former top official in the US, has admitted taking bribes related to the bidding process of at least two World Cups including South Africa in 2010. The Pentagon admits its scientists mistakenly sent samples of live anthrax to more than 50 different labs around the world including South Korea and Australia. South Korea is introducing emergency measures to contain the outbreak of the deadly virus known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS. More than 200 schools have been closed, and a hospital where a patient was diagnosed as suffering from MERS has been quarantined. Two people have died in the current outbreak there, and there are some 30 other confirmed cases. President Park Geun-Hye says stopping the virus from spreading further is the government’s main priority. TRANSLATION: To stop MERS from spreading, we need to discuss the measures for a thorough quarantine. If hospitals and the staff working in them have had even minor contact with infected people, we have to decide how to prevent further spread. Once we make these decisions, we have to be open and honest with the public about what we plan to do. Let’s talk to our correspondent in Seoul, Steve Evans. This is developing into a study on how the virus can be dealt with. Yes, and maybe how it shouldn’t be dealt with. You talk of quarantine, one of the things that is emerging is that the quarantine has not been absolutely tight. There are stories in the papers of one person who should have been in quarantine going out to play golf, for example. A person who had contracted symptoms took a flight to Hong Kong, and has therefore taken the virus to Hong Kong. A lot of questions for the government and the morning papers are absolutely full of it, as you can expect. I don’t know if you can see this picture, but people in the streets with masks, you see them all the time, so you get a sense of unease among ordinary people. People simply don’t know what to make of what they think is a lack of information and a lack of an absolutely tight system to stop this thing expanding in the way that health experts fear it could if the systems aren’t in place, in that kind of exponential way. As ever, balancing the flow of information is tricky. If there isn’t enough, rumours proliferate. Apparently there is a rumour, apparently false, that the virus has mutated. Yes, there is the difficulty for the authorities. Public health officials also have to weigh up whether you get a lot of information at their and run the risk of promoting panic where it is unnecessary, or do you keep information below. The risk is that the vacuum of information is filled with all kinds of speculation and rumour, which whizzes around on the internet. There is no evidence that this virus has migrated or mutated, but the rumour is out there, false rumour. We have some problems with a link, we will leave it for now. Thank you to that information. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras is suggesting an agreement over the country’s debt crisis is in sight. After late-night talks with European partners in Brussels, he declared Greece and its creditors are now very close to a deal which would avoid the tough austerity measures of the past. ~ I believe that in a few days, in the next days, there will be an agreement. I believe that in any case agreement is in sight, but we need to conclude the discussions from a realistic point of view. In China, time is running out to find any more survivors from the cruise ship that capsized in bad weather on the Yangtze River on Monday. Hundreds of rescue workers are at the scene. At least 65 people are known to have died, but more than 300 are still missing. Angry relatives have protested near the site of the sunken boat saying they’re not being given enough information. There has been a diplomatic incident between the Philippines and China, with angry words being expanded. When America and japan voiced their concerns, with the reclamation efforts. China is relieved of its responsibility as a community of nations to adhere to international law. The commentators on these documentaries were saying, what if somebody said stop to Hitler at that point in time, could we have avoided World War Two? Thousands of people have filled a plaza in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, in protest at violence against women. A series of murders have shocked the country, including a primary school teacher murdered in front of her class by her estranged husband. Argentina has adopted laws against domestic violence but campaigners say they aren’t being implemented effectively. It’s exactly 26 years since the Chinese military rolled tanks and troops into Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing to forcibly remove the students who’d been protesting there. Live rounds were fired, and hundreds of demonstrators died. The Chinese authorities ignored the international outcry and instead gave a specially commissioned watch to the soldiers and police who were deployed that day. One of the craftsmen who made them was Xu Yaonan. Here’s his story. TRANSLATION: When you look at a watch, every piece of it is dead and cold. But after being assembled by warm hands, everything comes to life. The Beijing Watch Factory was built by the state in 1958. It was the start of China’s watchmaking industry. For the first time, all the parts of our watches were made here in China. I was assigned to work here in 1962. When I first entered the factory, it was amazing to see all the brand-new machines and young workers. EVâI’yoIâ1â WGS So pI’oUd. Back then, people could only use coupons to buy a watch. It was among the three big items every family dreamt of owning. A watch, a sewing machine and a bicycle. This watch is special. It was ordered by the Mayor of Beijing to commemorate the quelling of the Tiananmen Square riots in 1989. We made tens of thousands of them and they were sent to different army squads and police who had participated in the crackdown. We focused on making these watches really well. All slick and waterproof. It is one of our contributions to society. But we really can’t discuss it. It’s still sensitive. The Tiananmen incident still has a chilling effect when people talk about it. Many died there for no reason. This big order helped us through a difficult period of time. Our watch production was hit badly by the new watches. We struggled for a very long time. Now I have retired, but I still live in the factory compound and help out. I want people in China to learn about us and ourfirst-class watches, made here in the Beijing Watch Factory. Now, many people have bucket lists which include swimming with dolphins or taking part in an extreme sport. But this was top of the bucket list of 90-year-old Walter Thomas in Woodstock, Illinois. Set up by his grandchildren, Mr Thomas smashed an old truck through the garage doors of one of his family’s homes. The garage was due for demolition and the truck destined for the scrap heap but the event certainly made one nonagenarian happy. just a justa reminderof just a reminder of the main news, Chuck Blazer from Fifa in the US has admitted to taking bribes for at least two World Cups, including South Africa in 2010. Thank you for watching. For many of us, today will be the warmest weather we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will be hotter still on Friday across eastern England with high levels of humidity, bringing a risk of thunderstorms. Thunderstorms already forming across Spain, and that will drift across France over the next 24 hours, the risk on Friday. Overnight, turning chilly in rural areas with temperatures getting down to single figures, towns and cities relatively mild. Plenty of warm sunshine on Thursday, there could be an early morning isolated fog patch, but most will start off clear. We will keep the sunshine into the afternoon as well. A different story further north, Northern Ireland and Scotland will have more cloud than we had on Wednesday, and that will be thick enough to give us a little bit of rain. In the sunshine further south, temperatures will be soaring, 23 or maybe 24 somewhere across London or south-east England and East Anglia. That’s where the real warmth is on Thursday afternoon. Heading into Friday, heat and humidity will build, feeling a little oppressive for some. Temperatures will reach 25 or 26 degrees in the warmest areas. With the heat comes humidity. That combination of heat and humidity is likely to spark some thunderstorms, particularly across parts of eastern England. Storms arriving early in the day may not have too much in the way of heavy rain, but they could have big drops and lots of thunder and lightning. Storms later in the afternoon could be heavy indeed. just to the west of this line of thunderstorms, a slice of dry and brighter weather, still perhaps feeling a little on the humid side. Across south-west England and Wales, into north-west England and Scotland, this is where there will be a cold front, bringing outbreaks of rain. Behind the cold front, skies will brighten up. A fresh feel here. Temperatures in Belfast around 15 degrees. Through Friday night, the cold front sweeps across the British Isles, introducing fresher air. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, bringing with it some blustery showers and strong winds. Feeling cool as well. 12 degrees in Glasgow, England and Wales in the sunshine feeling reasonable and fresher. By Sunday, more of us will enjoy more of that dry and sunny weather as showers become less widespread. The weather improving through the weekend. ~ This is BBC News. The USjustice Department has released details of the web of corrupt payments that it says lie behind the FBI investigation into Fifa. Former top official in the US Chuck Blazer says he and others executives took bribes during the selection of the 1998 and 2010 world cups. US defence officials have admitted the number of laboratories that were sent potentially live samples of anthrax is more than double the original estimate. 51 facilities in the United States received consignments, as well as laboratories in Canada, Australia and South Korea. Heavy fighting has broken out in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian rebels. It’s one of the worst breaches of February’s ceasefire. The fighting is centred around the town of Maryinka, near the main crossing point into rebel territory. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of provocative action. Now on BBC News, Wednesday in Parliament with Keith MacDougall. Hello and welcome to Wednesday in Parliament, our look at the best of the day in the Commons and the Lords. On this program: It’s back. -- On this programme: It’s back. After a two-month absence, Prime Minister’s Questions returned to Westminster. He promised £12 billion of welfare cuts and I’m asking where those welfare cuts are coming from. Absolutely no answer from the Labour Party about housing association tenants. Getting used to the nationalists in the Commons - an SNP MP puts David Cameron on the spot. Because if the Prime Minister cannot run an immigration policy that works for Scotland, then I know a government up the road that would be very happy to... And does England need more elected mayors? If it’s good enough for Berlin, good enough for Frankfurt, good enough for New York, good enough for Chicago, no reason why it should not be good enough for the great cities of this country. But first, Ed Miliband’s resignation straight after the general election has left Harriet Harman minding the shop. She’ll be doing the job of challenging David Cameron at Prime Minister’s Questions until the new Labour leader is chosen, which won’t be until the end of the summer. At the first PMQs of the new Parliament, she said David Cameron would no longer be able to blame problems on the previous prime minister because that was him. First, she focused on housing and had a simple sounding question for the Prime Minister. Can he tell us, since he became Prime Minister in 2010, has the percentage of people owning their own home gone up or gone down? Well, it has been a very challenging time for people to buy their own homes but what we are responsible for is almost 100,000 people able to buy their own homes because of right-to-buy and because of help-to-buy. She turned to the Conservative election promise that would allow housing association tenants to buy their homes. He has promised under this new scheme the replacement of sold-off properties on a one-for-one basis. He promised that on council homes in the last Parliament. Can he remind us whether he kept that promise? First of all, if she is complaining about home ownership, will she confirm she will support the extension of right-to-buy to housing associations? Will you support that approach? Will you support... There we are. There we have it. A landmark manifesto commitment. Let’s expand the right to buy to housing associations but, as ever, the enemies of aspiration in the Labour Party won’t support it. SPEAKER: Harriet Harman. We support more people owning their own home, which is not what happened under the last five years of him being Prime Minister. We support more people having an affordable home as well. And that did not happen and the last five years of him being Prime Minister either. Can he confirm that for every affordable home sold and not replaced, the housing benefit bill goes up? Well, first of all, we built more council homes in the last five years than were built under 13 years of the last Labour government. Harriet Harman switched to proposed changes to child benefit. Earlier this week, his spokesperson confirmed the government would not make any changes to child benefit and that is a commitment for the whole of this Parliament. Can he confirm that now? SPEAKER: Prime Minister. We made it very clear our position on child benefit in the election. I confirm that again at the dispatch box. But let us be clear- absolutely no answer from the Labour Party about housing association tenants. We are clear. They should have the right to buy. So, we can now see the new Labour backing of aspiration after the election has lasted three weeks. Can he tell us about another issue of importance to families, which is whether he is going to rule out further cuts to working families’ tax credits? Yeah, we have said we are freezing tax credits in the next few years because we need to get the deficit down and we want to keep people’s taxes down. But isn’t it interesting that the whole of the last Parliament, Labour came here and opposed every single spending reduction, every single welfare saving, and they have learned absolutely nothing? He promised £12 billion of welfare cuts and I’m asking where those welfare cuts are coming from. Mr Speaker, before an election it’s about the promises. Now they’re in Downing Street, it’s about the delivery. The Prime Minister spent the last five years saying everything that was wrong was because of the previous prime minister. Well, he can’t do that for the next five years because the last prime minister was him. We think we should cut the welfare cap from £26,000 per household to £23,000 per household. Now, in her speech, it sounded like she was going to come out and support that. So, why not? Let’s see how Labour are going to approach this. With you support a cut on the welfare cap? -- Will you support a cut on the welfare cap? The right honourable lady has had her six questions. Under the right to buy plan, three social houses will need to be sold to generate enough revenue to build one new one, leaving 1,500 families in York without a home for well over two years. Is this what the Prime Minister means by aspiration? First of all, let me welcome the honourable lady to the House and congratulate her on her election victory. There are two things that we’re doing to provide these replacement houses. One is obviously for every housing association that sells a home, it has that receipt and is able to build a new house. But also, we are making sure...we are making sure that councils actually sell off the most expensive council houses they have when they become vacant. In parts of London there are council houses worth over £1 million and you can build many, many more houses. But what is clear from this Question Time is on this side of the House, we understand home ownership, aspiration, people wanting to get on. The party opposite, after the most catastrophic election defeat in years, can’t even begin to spell aspiration. And the Prime Minister seemed intrigued by a question from another new MP on the economy. SPEAKER: Cat Smith. Can the Prime Minister inform the house when he expects the UK to regain its triple-A credit rating? First of all, can I welcome the honourable lady to her place and congratulate her on her election success? And if I might say, I think the first question she asks, which is about fiscal responsibility and sustainability - I take that as a sign of progress. I would say to her there is a leadership election on. Throw your hat in the ring! In that one question she has made more sense than all the rest of them put together! Go for it! Now, there’s a challenge from David Cameron. The election four weeks ago was a seismic event in political terms. The Liberal Democrats were replaced as the third biggest party in the Commons by the SNP. That gives the Scottish nationalists certain rights they did not have before. One of those is for their leader to ask two questions to the Prime Minister at the weekly session of PMQs. Angus Robertson focused on an international issue. It’s a stain on the conscience of Europe that thousands and thousands of refugees have been dying in the Mediterranean when many lives could have been saved. Does the Prime Minister agree that the role of the Royal Navy, the Italian Coast Guard and the navies of other EU countries make a profound difference, however much more needs to be done, including offering refuge and asylum to those who need it? David Cameron called the situation a tragedy. We need to break the link between getting on a boat and achieving residence in Europe. That is what needs to be done. In the meantime, everything Britain can do as a moral and upstanding nation to save lives we will do and we should be proud that we are doing it. And 80 years ago, that is what the UK did when it offered refuge to and asylum to those who were being pursued by the Nazis. And we all know about the Kindertransport and the children that were accepted and given refuge. Now, in contrast however, the UK has an appalling record on the resettlement of Syrian refugees and is not prepared to cooperate with other European nations on accepting refugees that have been rescued in the Mediterranean. Why does the Prime Minister think that it is fair for Sweden and for Germany and for other countries to accept these refugees while the UK turns its back on them? The vast majority of people who are setting off into the Mediterranean are not asylum seekers but are people seeking a better life. They have been tricked and fooled by criminal gangs and our role should be going after those criminal gangs, sorting out the situation in Libya, turning back those boats where we can and making sure with our generous aid budget that this government achieves, 0.7%, that we use that money to mend the countries from which these people are coming. That is our moral responsibility and one I’m proud to fulfil. Then came another SNP question. Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister might be aware of the ongoing case in my constituent, Dr Steve Foreman, who despite his immense contribution to the music and creative scene in Glasgow, Scotland and around the world, the Home Office has seen fit to try to deport back to the US. Can the Prime Minister tell the House why people like Dr Foreman don’t seem to be welcome in this country? Because if the Prime Minister cannot run an immigration policy that works for Scotland, then I know a government up the road that would be very happy to. First of all, can I congratulate the honourable gentleman on his election? I’m not aware of the specific case that he raises but I will look at it urgently after Prime Minister’s Questions and see what I can do. The chamber stayed full after Prime Minister’s questions for tributes to Charles Kennedy, who died suddenly on Monday at the age of 55. It was a highly emotional occasion not least because Mr Kennedy’s 10-year-old son was watching from one of the side galleries as MPs shared their many memories of a man who became an MP atjust 23, rose to become leader of the Liberal Democrats and had onlyjust left Parliament because he lost his seat to the SNP. Our liberal political family has lost one of its most admired advocates. British politics has lost one of its best storytellers. This House has lost one of its warmest wits and most loyal pa rliamentaria ns. Mr Speaker, if we could all carry ourselves with a little more of the honesty, wisdom and humility of Charles Kennedy, politics would be held in much higher esteem than it is today. We all know that Charles Kennedy was a formidable and witty debater and his skills were honed long before he was elected to this chamber, unbelievably at the age of 23. His skills were honed at his beloved Glasgow University. As anybody who has debated against anybody from Glasgow University, they will attest to the prodigious talent that has come through the Glasgow University Union and the Dialectic Society. It is in a league of its own. It has won more world championships than Oxford and Cambridge combined. Glasgow has won 15 times, significantly more than any university. I had the honour and pleasure of knowing Charles for some 37 years. When I first went to Glasgow University Union, he was already the star of the debating chamber there. Infact, he was the pre-eminent debater of his generation. He was terrifying to speak against but a positive joy to compete alongside. He had tremendous debating skills with which he regularly enriched this chamber and it’s a pity that those members who were elected just last month will never have the joy of seeing how enriching he could be to this House of Commons. I will remember him for integrity, humanity and decency. I wonder how many of us in this House will have that accolade. And I’m very sad for his family, for their untimely loss, but I’m sad for us all because our entire public life is poorerfor his passing. Several MPs referred to Charles Kennedy’s opposition to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. We opposed the war from the very start, and for us it was straightforward, we were united in opposition. For Charles Kennedy though I think it was a big challenge. Taking the brave decision to lead his party against the war, here and in the media, and having to fight to get some of his colleagues to follow. Standing against the war was not easy for any of us, it was not a comfortable place to be. Mr Speaker, we have come to this place not to be comfortable, but rather to do what we see as being right. Charles Kennedy took that path and it is a fitting tribute as he prevailed. People say politicians should have a life in politics before they become MPs. Maybe. Charlie was elected at 23, it is hard to argue that he did. It is not what you have done it is who you are, and Charlie Kennedy was a very special man. Donald, you should be really proud of your daddy. I am proud of your daddy, I love him to bits, I’m proud to call him my friend. He had that ability to bring levity to even the dark corners of British political life that made the bad days at the office easier to cope with. He had, as many honourable members know, all too painfully, politics often takes a toll on the lives of our loved ones in a way we never properly know or understand. The review, Mr Speaker, if I may, I would like to direct these words at Donald. The son of Charles and Sarah. Your father was a very great man. He stood up for what he believed in, he led a party of the centre-left with dignity and compassion and when you are older, you will know your mum and dad believed in a cause greater than themselves. And you will be proud. He loved campaigning, and indeed he still loves campaigning as we all saw in the recent general election campaign. His desire to appear in front of the electorate, both in terms of his own public meetings in the hustings, and that debating style that has been referred to by so many, and it was a privilege to campaign against him. I would say that when I look at the strength of our own ventures here today, with 56 members of the Scottish National Party being elected, it was truly the national tide that meant that Charles lost the seat of Ross, Skye and Lochaber. Charles Kennedy set the industry standard for humour and wit in politics. And I have to say this was rather distressing to some people who aspired to the foothills of that great Ben Nevis of wit that was Charles Kennedy. For many years, he and Austin Mitchell and julian Critchley enlivened the airwaves with a 3-way commentary on current affairs. They were known as Mitch, Critch and Titch, which I think is unfair. Titch for Charles Kennedy? No, he was a fine figure of a man in every sense. He was a great figure of a man. My memory is notjust of the absolutely creasing the sides of the nation until our ribs ached with humour, notjust on the radio, not just on television, and if I may make a comment, earlier we spoke about Have I Got News For You, that you had to be prepared to be a prat or Charles Kennedy, I appeared on Have I Got News For You. Demonstrably, I’m not Charles Kennedy. Stephen Pound with some fond memories of the Liberal Democrat politician, Charles Kennedy, whose death was announced this week. You are watching our round-up of the day in the Commons and the Lords. Still to come, his father never made it to the job of PM, so could the son of Neil Kinnock go all the way to Downing Street? The prospect of the EU is already casting a long shadow of uncertainty over the British economy. MPs have been continuing their debate on the Queen’s Speech, with a focus on government plans for greater devolution. Scotland, Wales and the English regions are all set to win new powers, but ministers have faced opposition to their insistence that extra powers for areas of England must be coupled with the creation of elected mayors. The fact is this, one size fits all policy devised within remote departmental silos are simply incapable of nurturing a specifically cultural strength. It is distinct players in our local regions who are best placed to do this. We have got to give them the tools to be the masters of their own destinies, we have to give them the tools to do the job. We believe every corner of the country has the potential to deliver economic growth and personal prosperity. We will be taking the steps necessary to boost local, global growth in England, devolving powers to cities, towns and counties, allowing local people to take control of the economic levers in their areas. And there were plans of a so-called Northern Powerhouse. The north-west has created a newjob every 3.5 minutes, and now the Chancellor has taken the work of the economic rebalancing to the next stage by outlining his plan for a Northern Powerhouse. The cornerstone is the devolution deal already agreed with the leaders of Greater Manchester. I will give way in a moment. They will elect their own mayor who will be responsible and accountable for making Greater Manchester greater still. Why, if we are really serious about devolving things to local areas, we have to tell those communities how those arrangements should be best governed? Why do we have to insist on an elected mayor to enable powers to be devolved to combined authorities? In many cases, communities may decide elected mayors are the best way forward. Why is the government saying if you don’t have our version of government at local level, you can’t have the powers in the first place? It was barely three years ago that we have referenda in no fewer than 11 cities throughout England and Wales, and I think only one of them, Bristol if I remember rightly, we had a mayor deciding in favour of it. In Birmingham and Coventry, the idea was resoundingly rejected by the electorate. I was a sceptic of the Mayor of London at one point, but in the end it has become a diverse and varied city, and there is no reason why it if it is good enough Frankfort, Toulouse, New York or Chicago, it shouldn’t be good enough for the great cities of this country. What we do need to do is, and I think it is recognised by others, is to make sure we can find a likeness of devolving real fiscal power down to shire counties as well. Some latest thoughts on devolution. The Commons has been treated to more maiden speeches by new members of Parliament. Perhaps the day’s most notable newcomer was Stephen Kinnock, who is married to the PM of Denmark. He gave a bit of family background. I was born about 30 miles to the north-east of Tredegar, as was my father. My mother is from another country altogether, known as North Wales. They have always worked tirelessly, Mr Speaker, to combat injustice, and their dedication to public service has inspired me throughout my life. But he was fearful of the consequences if it and left the EU. The prospect of the UK leaving the EU has already cast a long shadow of uncertainty over the British economy. There is a real and present danger that our withdrawal would trigger Tatar Steel’s withdrawal from the UK, and the impact on my constituents would be disastrous. Edinburgh as a whole demonstrates the parallel worlds of wealth alongside poverty, and I’m constantly reminded of the dangers, the danger warnings from the world-renowned economist Stiglitz, that an unequal society not only limits our ability to compete, but is both a cause and consequence of volatility. Education holds the greatest hope for a life rich in promise. The consequences of its failure are housed in ourjails, our hospitals. We must always strive to improve our schools because it is here that we are setting up a child with the ability to look after themselves and their families in later life, and indeed to contribute to our society and our economy. My passion for social and community action, and my belief in hard work, enterprise and opportunity for all, remain my drivers. If we truly want communities to lead communities and business to flourish, we must continue to support them. But above all, as my predecessor, I am dedicated to serving my constituents, the communities and the people. The new Labour MP said there was a housing crisis in her area of south London. In recent weeks I met a family of six, both parents working and the eldest children studying for exams, living in a 2-bedroom privately rented flat. An NHS nurse sleeping with a newborn baby on her grandmother’s sofa. A cancer patient evicted from her privately rented home by a landlord who just wanted to raise the rent. Resolving the housing crisis requires big vision and a comprehensive approach. After the significant worsening of the housing crisis under the last government, I am dismayed that so few solutions are being offered. A former Health Secretary has put together the idea of funding the NHS in future years by the use of a dedicated health tax. Lord Fowler said the time to discuss different options for how to pay for the health service was at the start of a parliament. He was speaking as the Lords continued its debate on last week’s Queen’s Speech. I believe we should look at the options of financing health. I emphasise that the present model may be best, but let us at least look at the other options and set them out. That does not commit us, the government or anybody else to take a particular course, but it allows a foundation to be built upon which we can base policy. We should look at whether a separate health tax has some advantage in connecting the public more directly with the cost of health. We should look at some kind of health insurance along the lines of France or Germany, whether that is practical. We should look at where the patient charges could make a greater contribution. There has been great talk in recent days about the use of agency nurses, as part of the debate about privatisation in the health service. From my point of view, delivery of services free at the point of delivery is the absolutely top priority. If this can be delivered in a small minority of cases in order to ensure the best interests of the patient, by a private organisation, that is acceptable as long as it provides good value for the taxpayer and gives no advantage to the private company over NHS providers. Some views in the House of Lords, and that is it for this programme. join me for the next daily round-up. Until then, goodbye. For many of us, today will be the warmest weather we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will be hotter still on Friday across eastern England with high levels of humidity, bringing a risk of thunderstorms. Thunderstorms already forming across Spain, and that will drift across France over the next 24 hours, the risk on Friday. Overnight tonight, some low temperatures in the countryside. Towns and cities staying mild, 13 degrees in London. The best of the weather, the best of the sunshine, will be across England and Wales, where it will feel warmer than it did on Wednesday, but for Northern Ireland Scotland there will be more in the of cloud. The cloud may be thick enough through the afternoon to bring some spots, and it will be a bit on the cool side. For England and Wales, a glorious day. Temperatures could peak at around 23 or 24 degrees across parts of East Anglia and south-east England, and it will be hotter than that by Friday, with humidity levels really peaking. 25 or 26 degrees in the warmest areas. For some it will begin to be oppressive. The humidity is likely to spark thunderstorms most likely across England. Not huge amounts of rainfall from these, but lots of wonder and lightning. Into the afternoon, storms could turn quite heavy. To the west of the storms, it will be slightly drier and brighter, a little on the human side. The conference will bring outbreaks of rain, but eventually it will work into Scotland, and behind us, 15 degrees will feel pretty comfortable. Through the evening and overnight cold front will move away to the continent, taking the humidity with it. A fresher feel to the weather the start of the weekend, with blustery wind in Scotland. For England and Wales, reasonable weather, but still pleasant enough in the sunshine. Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting at home and around the globe. My name’s Mike Embley. Our top stories: Fifa’s former top official in the US admits taking bribes related to the hosting of at least two world cups, including South Africa in 2010. The Pentagon admits its bungling scientists sent samples of live anthrax to more than 50 different labs around the world. Rescue teams recover more bodies from the cruise ship which capsized on the Yangtze River. Hundreds more are still missing. Heavy fighting between government forces and rebels in Ukraine in one of the worst breaches of the ceasefire agreed four months ago. And unearthing the mysteries of the universe - scientists restart the Large Hadron Collider. They’re hailing it a new era in physics. -- They’re hailing it as a new era in physics. Hello. Chuck Blazer, the man who used to be Fifa’s top official in the United States, has admitted taking bribes in relation to the hosting of at least two world cups, including South Africa in 2010. He made that admission in 2013 but the court papers which include his evidence have only just been released. Our correspondent Nick Bryant has the latest from New York. These are the winning bids that are now part of the FBI’s global dragnet, the US authorities revealing this evening that they’re now looking into how Fifa awarded the World Cup to Russia and Qatar. But a figure at the heart of the investigation is an American, Chuck Blazer, who was not just a Fifa powerbroker, but one of its biggest cheerleaders. I think that Fifa’s doing a really excellentjob of promoting football around the world. If I look back 10 years, 20 years and see the progress we have made, I’m very proud of our accomplishments. But for the past three years, this businessman with a love of parrots has been singing like a canary, telling the US authorities what he knows about alleged corruption at the highest levels of the game and acting as an FBI informant who used a microphone, hidden in a key chain, to secretly record meetings. Nate Vinton is the New York journalist who broke the Chuck Blazer story. The IRS and the FBI, an agent from each agency found him on a street in New York and told him that they could put him in handcuffs right there on the spot or he could co-operate with their probe. This evening came the release of court documents detailing his guilty plea in 2013. In them, Blazer says he and others on the Fifa Executive Committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup. He also admitted organising a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup, which ended up being held in France. Hisjet-setting lifestyle included this flight with Nelson Mandela. His online blog - Travels with Chuck Blazer and Friends - reads like a cross between a Panini sticker album featuring all-time greats and the celebrity magazine Hello!. During their meeting at the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin told him he looked like Karl Marx but a former colleague, Mel Brennan, who has been watching this saga closely, says he was a fraudulent capitalist. Chuck was corrupt from the get go. There wasn’t a single relationship that he had in world football that wasn’t about garnering silent wealth onto himself and wasn’t about, as a result, jeopardising the sport’s ability to take care of the most vulnerable. Chuck Blazer spent his millions from racketeering, money laundering and tax evasion notjust on one luxury apartment in the exclusive Trump Tower in New York, but two - the second for the use of his cats. That one alone cost £4,000 a month. Presidents, princes, even popes - Chuck Blazer has met them all, but it’s his relationship with this man, Sepp Blatter, that will now come under scrutiny. Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York. It turns out live anthrax was mistakenly sent to 51 labs, in 17 American states and three other countries. That’s more than double the original estimate. The shipments, intended for research, were sent from a US military base over a ten-year period. So far, nobody has been infected. Ben Bland reports. Seen under a microscope it may look attractive, but this is anthrax and potentially deadly. Somehow, live samples were mistakenly sent to laboratories across the US, as well as Canada, Australia and South Korea. The Pentagon insists there’s no risk to the public. We put it in a Ziploc bag and close it up as another layer of protection for anything that lea ks. We provide absorbent material that would be just sufficient to capture the amount of liquid if it were all to leak out of the vial. Another seal to make sure nothing can leak. We put it in another box. They were sent from this army base in Utah over ten years. The virus, intended for research, should have been made inactive before being sent. So, was it a mistake or something more sinister? We will continue the investigation but as of this point there is absolutely nothing to indicate that this would be somebody who was trying to do this deliberately. At least 20 people have been treated as a precaution. 51 labs are known to have received the problem batches and that number could yet rise. Let’s round up some of the other main stories. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says an agreement over the country’s debt crisis is in sight after late-night talks with European partners in Brussels. Mr Tsipras said Greece and its creditors were now very close to a deal which would avoid the tough austerity measures of the past. Thousands of people have filled a plaza in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires in protest at violence against women. A series of murders have shocked the country, including a primary school teacher murdered in front of her class by her estranged husband. Argentina has adopted laws against domestic violence but campaigners say they aren’t being implemented effectively. Myanmar has landed more than 700 migrants who have been kept at sea since their boat was intercepted by the country’s navy last Friday. They’ve been taken to two camps near the border with Bangladesh. The migrants are thought to be a mix of Bangladeshis and Muslim Rohingyas from Myanmar. Officials in the Indian capital Delhi have banned the sale of one of the country’s most popular brands of instant noodle after food inspectors found it contained high levels of lead. Maggi noodles are produced in India for the domestic market and are also exported to several countries. Emergency workers in China searching for survivors after a cruise ship capsized on the Yangtze River have recovered more bodies. 65 people are now confirmed dead and hundreds more are still missing. Relatives of some of the passengers, who have been angered by the lack of official information, are reported to have broken through a police cordon as they attempted to reach the scene of the accident. Our correspondent Celia Hatton joins me now from Beijing. Relatives were breaking through because they felt they were not being told enough? That is right. There is a lot of anger right now where the relatives are just sitting and waiting. Hundreds are waiting in a nearby hotel. They have been given access to live television reports from Chinese state TV but they are not being told much more and those reports are not asking the big questions that the relatives are asking, including why this vessel was allowed to sail in stormy weather and when it did capsize, why the captain, chief engineer and some members of the crew were able to grab lifejackets to save themselves but did not issue a warning that something was wrong with the ship. There is a lot of anger at the moment. Will people ever know the answers? We really don’t know at this point. There has been some reports about the ship itself. In 2013... There are reports that it was sidelined for a while because of major defects. There was a 1-page, vague list of these defects including concern over safety systems and emergency protocols, but we really don’t know how long the vessel was sidelined for and whether those problems were addressed. How would you characterise the attitude of officialdom to this kind of disaster? In public relations terms, it was very keen in showing that the Premier was being sent to the location. Dilemma we are seeing a disconnect between what the government is saying. --. We are seeing. At the top, the government is making grand pronouncements that they will do whatever they can in the effort. They are sending every resource to the site. However, the family members are having a much different experience. They say that local officials are not giving them any information and they are quite frustrated. We are seeing two different layers of the government reacting quite differently to this problem. Thank you. South Korea is introducing emergency measures to contain the outbreak of the potentially deadly virus known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS. At least two hundred schools have been closed, and a hospital where a patient was diagnosed with MERS has been quarantined. -- 200 schools. Two people have died and there are about 30 other confirmed cases. President Park Geun-Hye has declared the government’s main priority is stopping the virus spreading further. TRANSLATION: To stop MERS from spreading, we need to discuss the measures for a thorough quarantine. If hospitals and the staff working in them have had even minor contact with infected people, we have to decide how to prevent further spread. Once we make these decisions, we have to be open and honest with the public about what we plan to do. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provocative action after the worst day of violence in Ukraine for months. Officials in Moscow claim the Ukrainian Army shelled civilian areas. In Kiev, they claim pro-Russian rebels launched a large-scale offensive. The fighting centred on the town of Maryinka, near the main crossing point into rebel territory. From eastern Ukraine, Tom Burridge. On part of the frontline today it at least felt like the war was back on. GUNFIRE. It sounded like it, too. Even though the firing in eastern Ukraine has never really stopped, despite the supposed peace deal, it’s the heaviest fighting we have witnessed in several months. And in a village, just back from the frontline, Sasha, Katya and their young daughter, Anya, take shelter under ground. Ten-year-old Anya says she couldn’t go to school today because of the shelling. TRANSLATION: It’s so scary. I can’t bear to listen. I want it to finish soon. Her mother, Katya, tells us the family have nowhere else to go, so they’ll stay here until the bombs stop. Today fighting raged around Maryinka, a town next to the main check point to cross the frontline. This is a road we’ve travelled down dozens of times over the last few months. It’s a road that civilians use every day to go from government-controlled Ukraine into rebel-controlled territory to visit their relatives or to go to work, but within a matter of hours the dynamic at least in this part of this region has changed significantly. Who controls Maryinka tonight is unclear. Today’s fighting, filmed here by pro-Russian rebel troops, was concentrated in one place but the fear is that things could escalate further and it will test the faith of leaders in European capitals to the west, who are trying to negotiate with Russia for peace. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in eastern Ukraine. Still to come: The story behind the watch and its role in modern Chinese history. Let’s round up the stories making newspaper headlines around the world. The japan Times leads again with the pension scandal gripping the government. The paper carries details of how hackers sent a computer virus via email. They were able to steal details from more than one million people. China Daily reports on the rising tension with the Philippines over the South China Sea. It describes the shock in Beijing at comments from the Philippines president comparing China to Nazi Germany. The Pentagon wants Congress to lift a ban on buying rockets from Russia, according to the International New York Times. It was introduced last year in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The paper quotes officials who say they need access to the equipment for a few more years. Finally, the Straits Times has a story on a new defence deal signed between India and the US. The ten-year agreement covers joint military exercises and maritime security. This is BBC News. The latest headlines: Chuck Blazer, Fifa’s former top official in the US, has admitted taking bribes related to the bidding process of at least two world cups, including South Africa in 2010. The Pentagon admits its scientists mistakenly sent samples of live anthrax to more than 50 different labs around the world, including South Korea and Australia. Amnesty International has released a damning report on the Nigerian military, naming officers that it says should be investigated for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It accuses several senior commanders of being responsible for the deaths of thousands of young men as part of the fight against Boko Haram. Will Ross has more - and a warning, his report contains images and language that some viewers may find disturbing. Amnesty International says over the last four years, thousands of men and boys have died in military detention. They were all held in the north-east of Nigeria, where the military has been responding to the Boko Haram insurgency. Amnesty is responding to these photos, showing people being arrested on suspicion they belong to Boko Haram. This picture shows the children separate it from the adults during a screening operation in 2013. Those arrested were held in such grim conditions, Amnesty says 7000 suspects died in custody, many from suffocation, starvation and disease, including here at these notorious barracks in Maiduguri. The same facility Boko Haram broke into last year, setting hundreds of people free. Amnesty International is also focused on killings carried out by the military, containing videos with atrocities. A huge amount of evidence, including videos, witness statements and documents from the Nigerian government itself, showing that these commanders knew and condoned the war crimes that we documented in this report. Despite our reports and our statements and out letters, there have been no individual investigations for responsibility for war crimes and potential crimes against humanity. We therefore bring out this report essentially to put pressure on the government of Nigeria to investigate. Amnesty says documents prove that the military command was made aware of the abuses, but it is no action was taken. What makes this report different from others that have alleged human rights abuses is that Amnesty International is recommending senior military officials be investigated for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Defence spokesman has responded, describing the report as biased and concocted, an attempt, he said, to rubbish the image of the military. All eyes are now on Nigeria’s new president, Muhammadu Buhari, who clearly knows he has inherited a problem. In his inaugural speech he said he would overhaul the rules of engagement to prevent human rights violations by the Armed Forces. The war against Boko Haram goes on, a violent campaign has killed tens of thousands, and violations of abuse on both sides have come forward. There’s been an angry diplomatic exchange between China and the Philippines triggered by the ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea. This latest spat began when the Philippines President Benigno Aquino made a veiled comparison between China’s land reclamation activities to Nazi Germany’s expansionism in the run up to the Second World War. Here’s a little of what he had to say to the japanese Parliament. When America and japan talk about their concerns and when this is also seconded by the EU and other countries that have expressed concern, it reminds China of its diplomatic responsibility as a member of the international community. The commentators were saying, what if somebody had said stop to Hitler at that point in time or to Germany at that time? Could we have avoided World War II? It’s exactly 26 years since the Chinese military rolled tanks and troops into Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing to forcibly remove the students who’d been protesting there. Live rounds were fired, and hundreds of demonstrators died. The Chinese authorities ignored the international outcry and instead gave a specially commissioned watch to the soldiers and police who were deployed that day. One of the craftsmen who made them was Xu Yaonan. Here’s his story. TRANSLATION: When you look at a watch, every piece of it is dead and cold. But after being assembled by warm hands, everything comes to life. The Beijing Watch Factory was built by the state in 1958. It was the start of China’s watchmaking industry. For the first time, all the parts of our watches were made here in China. I was assigned to work here in 1962. When I first entered the factory, it was amazing to see all the brand-new machines and young workers. EVâI’yoIâ1â WGS So pI’oUd. Back then, people could only use coupons to buy a watch. It was among the three big items every family dreamt of owning. A watch, a sewing machine and a bicycle. This watch is special. It was ordered by the Mayor of Beijing to commemorate the quelling of the Tiananmen Square riots in 1989. We made tens of thousands of them and they were sent to different army squads and police who had participated in the crackdown. We focused on making these watches really well. All slick and waterproof. It is one of our contributions to society. But we really can’t discuss it. It’s still sensitive. The Tiananmen incident still has a chilling effect when people talk about it. Many died there for no reason. This big order helped us through a difficult period of time. Our watch production was hit badly by the new Quartz watches. We struggled for a very long time. Now I have retired, but I still live in the factory compound and help out. I want people in China to learn about us and ourfirst-class watches, made here in the Beijing Watch Factory. Let’s update you now on Solar Impulse, the solar powered plane attempting to fly all the way round the world, albeit with a few stops on the way. The plane’s wings have been damaged by high winds while on the ground injapan. It had to make an unplanned stop there after flying into bad weather en route from China to Hawaii. It will take at least a week to repair. The world’s biggest particle collider is back up and running after a two-year shutdown. The huge underground facility that houses the Hadron Collider is buried beneath the Swiss-French border and it’s there that scientists are working to unlock some of the mysteries of our universe. Our science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, reports. Cheers at the Large Hadron Collider for what the researchers here expect to be a new era of physics. The man in charge had this message for his staff. Thanks to everybody, and now let’s see new physics! But he said that the breakthroughs would not happen immediately. Do not expect it will be tomorrow, don’t expect it will be in a month, be patient, OK? In the corner, a bottle of Higgs single malt whiskey, created in celebration of this moment three years ago. As Peter Higgs wipes away a tear, when researchers discovered the Higgs Boson - the particle that holds the universe together. But what is set to follow will be even more remarkable. It is quite possible that a couple of years from now, we will look back on this moment and say, ""This was the start of our understanding of 21st-century physics."" This was the period when we opened up the door to knowing what the majority of the universe is made of. Not what we happen to be made of, which is the electrons and protons of what we call the standard model, but what 95% of the universe is made of. That will be a huge step forward for our understanding of why we are here and where we come from. Following its upgrade, the LHC is smashing particles together at twice the energy it was before. The development means that from today physicists will be able to see completely new things in the subatomic world. It is as if they have a new microscope with vastly greater magnification. It is a great moment, it is a great emotion. I think this is an arrival point, because people have been working for this for years. The current theory explains how just 5% of the universe works. Researchers hope they will soon find evidence of mind-bending new ideas that involve extra dimensions, invisible so-called super symmetrical particles, and evidence of what researchers call the dark universe. Now, you may have been lead to believe that sharks are not the friendliest of animals but you may have to think again. In an aquarium on the Pacific island of New Caledonia this worker takes a break from cleaning the tank to give this leopard shark a bit of care and attention. The seemingly placid shark appears to be enjoying itself rolling over and savouring a good scratch and hug. Now, many people have bucket lists which include swimming with dolphins or taking part in an extreme sport. But this was top of the bucket list of 90-year-old Walter Thomas in Woodstock, Illinois. Set up by his grandchildren, Mr Thomas smashed an old truck through the garage doors of one of his family’s homes. The garage was due for demolition and the truck destined for the scrap heap but the event certainly made one nonagenarian happy. just a reminder of the main news, Chuck Blazer from Fifa in the US has admitted to taking bribes for at least two World Cups, including South Africa in 2010. Thank you for watching. And you can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. I’m @BBCMikeEmbley. For many of us, today is going to be the warmest day that we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will still be hot across parts of eastern England with high levels of humidity, bringing risk of thunderstorms. This will be drifting across France over the next few hours, bringing storms to parts of England on Friday. Turning quite chilly in rural areas overnight, with temperatures getting into single figures. Towns and cities relatively mild. Plenty of warm sunshine across England and Wales, and we could catch and early morning isolated fog that, but most will start off clear, keeping sunshine into the clear. In Northern Ireland in Scotland there will be more clout than we had on Wednesday, which will be thick enough to give a little rain, although amounts are likely to be quite small. In the sunshine, temperatures are soaring. Maybe 23 or 24 across London, south-east and East Anglia. As we head into Friday, heat and humidity will build, so feeling a little oppressive for some. Temperatures will reach 25 or 26 degrees, and with fact sheet, there will also be increasing humidity. That combination is likely to spark some thunderstorms in the particularly across parts of eastern England. The storms arriving early in the day may well not have too much in the way of heavy rain, but they could have big drops and lots of thunder and lightning. The storms later in the afternoon could be pretty heavy, and just to the west of this line of thunderstorms, a slice of drier and brighter weather. Still feeling on the human side, and across south-west England and Wales and Scotland we will have a cool front. A fresh feel to the weather with temperatures in Belfast around 15 degrees. This front will sweep across the British Isles, introducing fresh air. This is how the chart looks on Saturday, low pressure to the north of Scotland bringing blustery showers and strong wind, and feeling cool. For England and Wales in the sunshine, still feeling reasonable. By Sunday, more of us will enjoy more of the dry and sunny weather as showers become certainly less widespread, highs reaching 21. The weather improving through the weekend. The latest headlines from BBC News. The USjustice Department has released details of the web of corrupt payments that it says lie behind the FBI investigation into Fifa. Former top official in the US, Chuck Blazer, says he and others executives took bribes during the selection of the 1998 and 2010 World Cups. US defence officials have admitted the number of laboratories that were sent potentially live samples of anthrax is more than double the original estimate. 51 facilities in the United States received consignments, as well as laboratories in Canada, Australia and South Korea. Emergency workers in China searching for survivors after a cruise ship capsized on the Yangtse River have recovered more bodies. 65 people are now confirmed dead. Hundreds more are still missing. Dozens of people broke through a police cordon demanding news of missing relatives. Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire is to stay closed for a second day. Health and safety officials continue their investigation into a crash on a rollercoaster on Tuesday. Four people were seriously injured on the ride, famous for its multiple loops. Merlin Entertainments, that runs the park, says it was devastated by what happened. 18-year-old studentjoe Pugh and 17-year-old Leah Washington were sitting in the front row of the rollercoaster when the ride went horribly wrong. They are among the four left seriously injured in yesterday’s crash. He was sat up, you hope and pray that he is a cave. You send his best wishes to the family -- your best wishes. Today, all rides were grounded. Alton Towers closed following yesterday ‘s rescue operation. Alton Towers closed following yesterday’s rescue operation led by experienced paramedic, Peter Howell. It was like a road traffic accident that had taken place at 25 feet in the air. We had two young men with head injuries and two young women with very severe leg injuries. It is very difficult to actually deal with. This mobile phone footage shows the momentsjust after the cars had collided. Everyone on the ride was screaming and we thought, well, that is what you do on a rollercoaster. But then we all realise they were not screaming because they were having fun, they were in an immense amount of pain. So, what went wrong? Witnesses saw the carriages collide at the top of a loop. They heard a loud bang. The Smiler has a top speed of 53 mph. Alton Towers said today the car was actually travelling at 20 mph. Safety provisions should have prevented the two cars from ever being on the same piece of track but that did not happen. These pictures show how the two cars, now locked together, continued to move at a pace following impact. Passengers were swung around the loop a number of times until the car came to a halt at the bottom of the rollercoaster. The owners of the theme park have been working with members of the Health and Safety Executive to try to find out why it did happen. Our hearts are still with the people who were injured. It is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of this park. Alton Towers remains closed tomorrow while investigators look at whether technical issue or human error was to blame. Now it’s Talking Books, and this week it comes from the Hay Book Festival. Hello, and welcome to Talking Books, here at Hay Festival in Wales. This year, it is describing itself as a giant party for writers, thinkers and commentators. It is always fun, often controversial, and definitely stimulating. Today I am going to be talking to Germaine Greer. APPLAUSE. It is a fantastic audience, isn’t it? Now, Germaine Greer was recently described by one commentator as having achieved national treasure status. She describes herself as curmudgeonly old feminist. I think neither of those do justice to the sheer range of her work, which is what I want to concentrate on today. There is the brilliance of her polemic, the depth of her literary and academic research, and her passion for nature, which is most recently reflected in her book White Beach. But I want to begin with the book which sent shock waves around the world and is still the best seller, till on book shelves here in Hay, I saw earlier. That is of course The Female Eunuch. Ijust want you to give us a sense of the context in which you wrote this book, because people look back on the decade of the 1960s, this book appeared in 1970, and talk about it as the great time of liberation. But, clearly that was not the case in your view. Well, in order to explain where I was coming from there, you get the women in America saying, ""we want to make policy, not coffee. We do not want to run the Xerox machine, we want to be drafting the texts you are using, we want to be represented in the ideologies that we represent"". So then you get, Betty Friedan writes The Feminine Mystique, The and The Feminine Mystique argues that after the Second World War women were sent back into the home to produce the children that had not been born drawing the war. And to be the warriors’ reward. To run the decent, comfortable, elegant house with wonderful food and all of that. After they had been working in factories, and having jobs. Or, indeed, in the Armed Forces. And her argument was that what this was doing was sexualising women. They had only a sexual function with relation to the men in their lives. That there was no other role for them. And I thought ""that’s wrong"". And when you came to the structure of the book, I wasjust rereading it, they are quite short chapters but each with a kind of very striking title. Fearand Loathing, Curves, so on. Hair. The one that makes me laugh now is Hair. In those days you could have some on your body as well as on your head. You could not have a lot... That you could have some. Now you cannot have any. Now the girls are being lasered until there is not a hair left on them. They are like newts. LAUGHTER. Why would anybody want to hug a newt? Except another newt, of course. Very strange. Ido think that is so funny, that I thought, culturally speaking, the management of hair is important. But I never thought we would get to this point with 13-year-olds are having full Brazilians, which cost a huge amount of money, number one, and hurt like the dickens. And that is because the boys think that if you do not have that you are dirty, you are ungroomed. Did I ever dream in my wildest nightmares we would get to this point? Never, but then I did not foresee anorexia either. It all got worse. During the last few years, let’s say in the last three decades, when all the push has been for equality. That is so interesting, you actually think it has got worse for women, do you? Yes, I think I do. I think the pressures are impossible. The terror of growing old is worse than it ever was. And the money made, £167 million is made on anti-ageing preparations that do not work. And the only way, the way it is marketed is by exploiting women’s anxiety. So women spend the money as if they were buying a charm, as if they were getting an amulet you could hang around your neck which would stop you ageing, leave you for ever young. LAUGHTER. So when you wrote The Female Eunuch, what power did you hope that book was going to have? Did you hope it was going to have the power to change things more than has actually happened? Ido not want to appear to agree that the book did change things. What changes things are people. People change things. Amongst other things, they changed the book. The book is not my best book, it is not my best written or best argued book. But they made it the great book, because of the energy that its readers put into it. They brought it all the things that I didn’t know. Now I was an escapee, I got scholarships to university, I was a university teacher, I had a career. I was independent and self defining, if I felt like taking a holiday I could go. I did not have to ask anybody. I was childless, that is true enough, and still am. But I was, as it were, an escapee from the system. And I did not really know where the shoe pinched. I had a fair idea, partly because of my mother’s madness. You know, my mother was a very destructive person. And I could see, and I can see more vividly now that I am older, I could see that she had a very active brain, she had a very vivid imagination. But all it ever did was tear her and everyone around her to pieces. And I think it was my intuition of her suffering that gave me a better notion of what it was like to be married. My mother was an intelligent woman, married to a stupid man. He was a very nice man and a very good man but he could not really deal with the top 5% of her imagination. I could not deal with it either, conversation with her was a nightmare. But I could feel the pain, that suffering from her. Then I made this mistake of getting married myself. To a man who made me sleep on the floor on my wedding night... That was not for very long, though, was it? Three weeks. LAUGHTER. Perhaps not surprisingly. I had to get out of there. It was a matter of life or death. But anyway, what then happens is that we have all this fuss and bother about the 50th anniversary of women getting the vote. And what have they done with it, they have not done anything... Politics has gone rambling on in its old school tie away. After this election, whatever you, you would probably disagree with the result, but there are certainly more women MPs than ever before. LAUGHTER. And Mrs Thatcher was a woman, correct. So? So isn’t it important that there is more female representation in parliament, isn’t that something that is worth having? Not if there is not a single Profeminist policy adopted by the government. We are only as good as the agenda. APPLAUSE. It is something we understand about the corporate world. You get ahead if you are the corporate person. The more effectively you absorb the company credo, the more likely you are to be promoted and the less likely you are to be a thorn in anybody’s side and you are not going to bring in innovations which people find awkward or difficult. You are going to be the perfect organisation person. That is why I am not excited about the EU saying that all directorial boards will have to have 40% women. Why 40%? What is magic about that? And who would they be? I mean, Mrs Thatcher, it was said about her that she was the only man in her Cabinet. I don’t believe that, actually. She was one of the first, obviously the first woman to become Prime Minister, but after her there are more and more women in politics. And some acts of parliament, do they not make any difference, the Equal Pay Act? The Sex Discrimination Act? Martha, you know the answer to these questions. LAUGHTER. Of course there is not equal pay now, but it is better than it was. There isn’t equal pay now. But it is better than, say, in 1970. Except that what happened then, was that the labour unions accepted the notion of equal pay for work of equal value. Now they should have known better than that. Work has no value. Work is worth what you can force the employer to pay for it. Nota pâI’1Iâ1y TT’IOI’â, oI’ S pâI’1Iâ1y less. It is ludicrous to say that the woman who is making upholstery for a car should be paid less than a man who is tightening a screw on the assembly line. But that is how the work became defined. Women’s work, look at hairdressing, look at the rates of pay for hairdressing. I mean one could wish that young women were not attracted to hairdressing, it is a hugger of a job and you hardly get paid at all. You go there as an apprentice and you virtually get paid not enough to get yourself a cup of coffee at 11am. Supposing they let you leave the floor at 11am. What actually happened was differential is between women’s work and men’s work became solidified. And now it is very hard to shift them. So women are doing jobs which are not actually directly comparable with men. And they actually have no experience of collective bargaining. They have no experience of collective action. It is no longer possible to bring pressure to bear. For example, to actually get the contract. I mean, nowadays more workers are working without a contract than ever before. And we also know that the gap between women’s real earnings and their male partners’ earnings, their male colleagues’ earnings, is increasing. And their lifetime earnings are much less than men’s. And we know why this is. We also know that taking maternity leave is not the best way to get promoted and get more money. So was it because you felt that not enough progress had been made, down the route of liberation for women, that you decided to write the sequel to The Female Eunuch, The Whole Woman. I think it was the sequel you said you would never write. Well, there is a lot of books in between that. There is Sex and Destiny, which is a book that nobody ever understood. Now I went looking for a society where women could acquire authority as they grew older. I wanted to go to societies where mothers were powerful figures. Where the wish of a mother was law. I went to India, I went to Sudan, I went all over the place, looking for women whose very body language said that they had power and authority. And I found them. But of course they belonged to successful extended families, and that as well as those people in these communities there are a lot of people who have no power at all and a lot of them are women. But I really wanted to see if there was a way that we could begin to support women as they grew older, and as they took on different roles. And if we could think of lifestyles for them. Even, dare I say it, clothes for them. Clothes for the woman over 50. Have a look at 50-plus, if you like jumping out of the window. I am going to have to wear this dreadful stuff?! Add you’ve written about society’s fear of older woman? Yes. Distrust. Guilt. But, in a way, it is so dreadful and it is so dreadful that every year, we hear more stories about aged care. Stories of elder abuse and stories about people being beaten and shouted at or left hungry or thirsty. We know how difficult the situation is because we have our elderly parents to think about and we know that if we’re going to really look after older people, we have to use the best available talent and not what is left over. Gerontology is the least respected department of medicine and the least popular. Nobody want to work in it because your patients are going to die and doctors hate that, they cannot handle it. It is why they are so bad at end of life care. There was also a very strong lobby for women. Aren’t you underestimating the power of women and women’s campaigns? Ahem! That’s a tricky question, isn’t it? How many campaigns were there? I have already said that marching doesn’t get you anywhere. The great thing about marching is they can see just how few people are really involved. There they are, they are only one street long, they will be fine. And it was such a silly thing because people thought we were saying, what do we want? We want abortion! When do we want it? We want it now! No! What we really want is a well more woman centred approach to the whole question of fertility management. Well, here is an example of how we haven’t got it. In Ireland, you still cannot get a pregnancy termination. I don’t think you can even take the morning after pill. But they have got single sex marriage. I also wanted to ask you, because the range of your writing is huge, actually. And I wanted to ask you about why you decided to embark on writing a memoir. You mentioned your father earlier, Daddy, We Hardly Knew You. It seemed to be quite a departure from some of your other writing? I think it is my best book, actually. Well, that began with me wanting to find out what happened to my father. Because he came back from the war an old man. And I think lots of us have had this experience. He was no longer handsome and debonair. He was absolutely destroyed. Heartbroken. He had been in Malta. He was not in Malta during the siege of Malta but afterwards. But he was working in the Enigma programme, he was working in the rock in Malta, in Valletta. And I wanted to know if my parents’ unhappiness was caused by the war. I wanted to be able to place it in the sufferings of my whole generation, we were all affected by the war. But we didn’t know how we were affected. We didn’t know what it did to our parents’ relationship. I know that my mother was very much admired by Americans - overpaid, oversexed and over here - in Australia, just as they were in England. And she probably thought that one of them would take her away to America and give her a glamorous life and instead, she got this exhausted old man whom she didn’t even recognise. I remember her walking up to him on the station where the troop train was and peering into men’s faces, just looking for a sight of him. And then they saw him, his greatcoat was stuck out from his neck because he was so thin, his teeth had fallen out because of nutrition. And we took him home and my sister was conceived eventually but there was some bad moments before that, which I only vaguely remember through a child’s distorted memory. So I wanted to find out how much damage that war did to me and to my generation. But when I started to investigate it, my first big problem was my father had no relatives. And then when I began looking for his relatives, I looked and looked and looked and it took me forever to realise that my father was living his life under an assumed name. And that was so weird that for ages, whenever I wrote my own name, it was in inverted commas, invisible inverted commas. Ijust could not even be me. I could not even have that name because it was a fake. Ido remember asking a policeman, can you get married under BI’] 8SSUTT’Iâd TlÃmÃ? And, to my surprise, he said, yes, you certainly can. What is the point of all these rules?! of me carrying a passport if someone CSI’] TT’I3I’I’y TTIE UI’1dâI’ BI’] 8SSUTT’Iâd TlÃmÃ? So, once I have started I had to go on. And eventually I tracked him down. But it still breaks my heart that he never heard his given name. Because his mother was a maid who was seduced by her employer, very common story. Who gave up her baby boy. She gave birth in a miserable cottage on what is now the parking lot of Safeways in Launceston. But she did one really brave thing. And, you know, they won’t let you look at the documents if you are not a party to the match. And there was I, trying to find it and the registrar in Tasmania said to me, I have got someone born on the 1st of September. And I said, it’s my father. Because that’s his birthday. It is one of the things you don’t change. He showed me the entry and she had given him his father’s name. He was called Robert Ernest Hamilton King. His mother’s name was Hing and his father’s name was Hamilton. At his father’s name was Richard Robert Ernest Hamilton. So she nailed him. And you could see by looking at the register that the registrar was nervous, he didn’t want to put that name in because this was a man of substance. This was an important public functionary. But she nailed him and the only thing is, Daddy would never have heard that name. It must have been an extraordinary moment for you and in your most recent book you also touch upon your family and your relationship with your sister. This is the book White Beach, about the rainforest that you bought in Australia. Yes. My sister is a botanist. As she grew up her two sons. And then went back to school. And studied botany at Melbourne University. And she had a really tough time. She was married to a wealthy man and they knew that and she was 40-some. And they ignoreed her as a student. And it took them three years to discover she was their best student. See what I mean? This sort of casual assumption that she was just wasting time, just keeping her off the streets. And she was brilliant. One of the things she was not convinced by was parallel evolution. Well, now hardly anybody else is either! There she was, going, no, I don’t think so. So theyjust ignored her. Yes,jane, no,jane. Then I went on botanising holidays with her. We crawled through the undergrowth, looking for germinating orchids and things like that. And took thousands of photographs. And then I made a movie at the Millennium for a Dutch company, which is my sister taking me through the flora of South West, Western Australia. Which is precious. But now threatened, badly threatened and dying. It was quite tricky for her at first, you having an interest in what she regarded as her sphere? I suppose your tanks were on her lawn? Well, yes. Yes, but you see, this is my naivety, really. I studied botany to be with her. And most of the best botany I studied was with her. But before long the sisterly venom crept into the situation and she began to think that I was competing with her. And I thought, now what do I do? And when I bought the rainforest I thought she would be involved in it. But she never meant to be. But now the project is almost complete. My workforce have said they will be finished, the forest will be replanted in five years, all of it. Which is an incredible achievement. They are the most amazing group of young men working for me. There are only three of them at the moment but they are terrific. And they are fast. So now they are saying it will be done in five years and I am thinking, I have to wind up the charity or get a new project. So if you know of a bit of Gondwanan rainforest that needs a hand, please let me know! Thank you very much indeed. APPLAUSE. For many of us, today will be the warmest weather we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will be hotter still on Friday across eastern England with high A different story further north, for Northern Ireland, Scotland, cloud is likely to thicken to bring a bit of rain. In the sunshine in London highs are expected to reach 23 degrees. Will get warmer than that across eastern England on Friday, but also much more humid as well. That combination of heat and a humidity is likely to bring some downpours. Across England, a slice of dry weather. Behind that, the air turns significantly fresher, which will reach all of us by Saturday. ~ Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers on public television in the US and around the globe. My name’s Mike Embley. Our top stories: FIFA’s former top official in the US admits taking bribes related to the hosting of at least two World Cups including South Africa in 2010. The Pentagon admits its bungling scientists sent samples of live anthrax to more than 50 different labs around the world. Rescue teams recover more bodies from the cruise ship which capsized on the Yangtze River, hundreds more are still missing. One of the world’s leading athletics coaches, Alberto Salazar, is at the centre of doping allegations following claims made by former staff and athletes, in a BBC investigation. And: Unearthing the mysteries of the universe - scientists restart the Large Hadron Collider, they’re hailing it a ‘new era in physics’. Hello to you. Chuck Blazer, the man who used to be FIFA’s top official in the United States, has admitted taking bribes in relation to the hosting of at least two World Cups, including South Africa in 2010. He made that admission in 2013 but the court papers which include his evidence have only just been released. Our correspondent Nick Bryant has the latest from New York. These are the winning bids that are now part of the FBI’s global dragnet, the US authorities revealing this evening that they’re now looking into how Fifa awarded the World Cup to Russia and Qatar. But a figure at the heart of the investigation is an American, Chuck Blazer, who was not just a Fifa powerbroker, but one of its biggest cheerleaders. I think that Fifa’s doing a really excellentjob of promoting football around the world. If I look back 10 years, 20 years and see the progress we have made, I’m very proud of our accomplishments. But for the past three years, this businessman with a love of parrots has been singing like a canary, telling the US authorities what he knows about alleged corruption at the highest levels of the game and acting as an FBI informant who used a microphone, hidden in a key chain, to secretly record meetings. Nate Vinton is the New York journalist who broke the Chuck Blazer story. The IRS and the FBI, an agent from each agency found him on a street in New York and told him that they could put him in handcuffs right there on the spot or he could co-operate with their probe. This evening came the release of court documents detailing his guilty plea in 2013. In them, Blazer says he and others on the Fifa Executive Committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup. He also admitted organising a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup, which ended up being held in France. Hisjet-setting lifestyle included this flight with Nelson Mandela. His online blog - Travels with Chuck Blazer and Friends - reads like a cross between a Panini sticker album featuring all-time greats and the celebrity magazine Hello!. During their meeting at the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin told him he looked like Karl Marx but a former colleague, Mel Brennan, who has been watching this saga closely, says he was a fraudulent capitalist. Chuck was corrupt from the get go. There wasn’t a single relationship that he had in world football that wasn’t about garnering silent wealth onto him self and wasn’t about, as a result, jeopardising the sport’s ability to take care of the most vulnerable. Chuck Blazer spent his millions from racketeering, money laundering and tax evasion notjust on one luxury apartment in the exclusive Trump Tower in New York, but two - the second for the use of his cats. That one alone cost £4,000 a month. Presidents, princes, even popes - Chuck Blazer has met them all, but it’s his relationship with this man, Sepp Blatter, that will now come under scrutiny. Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York. In the last few hours, the former Fifa vice president, jack Warner, made a televised address in Trinidad, claiming that he would prove a link between Fifa officials on the 2010 election in Trinidad & Tobago. He was speaking in a post- political advertising. He said that he would no longer keep secrets from people he said were actively seeking to destroy the country. It turns out live anthrax was mistakenly sent to 51 labs - in 17 American states and 3 other countries. That’s more than double the original estimate. The shipments, intended for research, were sent from a US military base over a ten year period. So far nobody has been infected. Ben Bland reports. Seen under a microscope, it may look attractive, but this is anthrax and potentially deadly. Somehow, live samples were mistakenly sent to laboratories across the US, as well as Canada, Australia and South Korea. The Pentagon insists there’s no risk to the public. We put it in a Ziploc bag and close it up as another layer of protection for anything that lea ks. We provide absorbent material that would be just sufficient to capture the amount of liquid if it were all to leak out of the vial. Another seal to make sure nothing can leak. We put it in another box. They were sent from this army base in Utah over ten years. The virus, intended for research, should have been made inactive before being sent. So, was it a mistake or something more sinister? We will continue the investigation but as of this point there is absolutely nothing to indicate that this would be somebody who was trying to do this deliberately. At least 20 people have been treated as a precaution. 51 labs are known to have received the problem batches and that number could yet rise. Let’s round up more of today’s news for you. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, says an agreement over the country’s debt crisis is in sight after late-night talks with European partners in Brussels. He suggested Greece and its creditors were near a deal that would avoid the tough austerity measures of the past. Thousands of people have filled a plaza in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, in protest at violence against women. A series of murders have shocked the country, including a primary school teacher murdered in front of her class, by her estranged husband. Argentina has adopted laws against domestic violence but campaigners say they aren’t being implemented effectively. Myanmar has landed more than 700 migrants who’ve been kept at sea since their boat was intercepted by the country’s navy last Friday. They’ve been taken to two camps near the border with Bangladesh. The migrants are thought to be a mix of Bangladeshis and Muslim Rohingyas from Myanmar. Officials in the Indian capital, Delhi have banned the sale of one of the country’s most popular brands of instant noodle, food inspectors found it contained high levels of lead. Maggi noodles are produced in India for the domestic market, and are exported to several countries. Emergency workers in China searching for survivors after a cruise ship capsized on the Yangtze River have recovered more bodies. 65 people are now confirmed dead, hundreds more are still missing. Relatives of some of the passengers are reported to have broken through a police cordon as they attempted to reach the scene of the accident. Our Beijing correspondent, Celia Hatton, says relatives are frustrated. There was a lot of anger right now, the relatives are sitting and waiting. We have heard reports that hundreds of relatives are waiting at a nearby hotel, access given to live television reports from Chinese state television. They say they aren’t being told much more. Those television reports are very factual, they are not asking the bigger question that relatives are asking, including, why was the ship allowed to sail in stormy weather? And when it did capsize, why did the captain, the chief engineer, and some members of the crew, why were they able to get lifejackets and save themselves, but they did not issue a warning, or alarm bell, that something was wrong with the ship? There is a lot of anger among relatives at the moment. Is any information coming out around these key questions? Are people ever likely to know? We really don’t know at this point. I think there has been some reports about the ship itself, in 2013, we have heard a very vague report that the ship was sidelined for a little while because of major defects. There has been a 1-page very vague list of the defects, including concerns over safety systems and emergency protocols. But we really don’t know how long the ship was sidelined for, and whether the problems were addressed. How would you characterise the attitude of officialdom to this kind of disaster? In public relations terms, they seem keen, first of all, the premier was sent there to the side straightaway? Absolutely, we are seeing a disconnect in what the government is saying. At the top, leaders in Beijing are making grand pronouncements, that they will do everything they can in the rescue effort. That they will send as many resources as possible to the site. The Chinese premier, as you said, went to the site to personally direct the rescue operation. But, the family members are having a different experience. They say local officials are not giving them any information, and they are quite frustrated. So really we are seeing two different layers of the government reacting differently to this problem with the ship. One of the world’s best known athletics coaches is at the centre of doping allegations following a BBC investigation. Among the claims is that Alberto Salazar was involved in doping Galen Rupp, the American long-distance runner. Both Rupp and Great Britain’s Mo Farah are part of Salazar’s training base in Oregon but there’s no suggestion that Mo Farah has broken any rules. The allegations come from a number of former athletes and staff. Alberto Salazar and Galen Rupp have strenuously denied any wrongdoing. The BBC’s Mark Daly has this exclusive report. This was the crowning moment for Alberto Salazar. His two biggest stars, taking gold and silver at the London Olympics. A US athletics legend himself, he is head coach at the prestigious Nikkei Oregon Project, home to Mo Farah since 2011. But now, a number of former athletes and staff who worked with him have made allegations to the BBC, about unethical practices and the use of banned steroids -- Nike. Steve Magnus was his assistant coach. In 2011, he says he saw a lab report from back in 20 -- 2002, relating to US 2000 metre record holder Galen Rupp. He took a picture. It had that he was currently on testosterone medication. When I saw that, jumped backwards. Wait a minute... medication. When I saw that, jumped backwards. Waita minute... On testosterone medication? Testosterone, that is obviously banned. I mean, I know that, everybody knew that. In response, Alberto Salazar says that the document is incorrect, and said what would have been recorded as testosterone medication was a legal nutritional supplement. Both he and Galen Rupp strenuously deny that Galen Rupp ever used testosterone. As part of a year-long investigation, I’ve heard a number of other allegations, including that Alberto Salazar experimented with testosterone to see how much would trigger a positive drugs test. Manipulated anti- doping rules and medical exemptions, and encouraged prescription drug used to help performance and weight loss. This woman is probably the most famous female athlete in America. She and her husband, Adam, both Olympians, were coached by Alberto Salazar for seven years. They told me that they witnessed anti- doping violations, as well as unethical behaviour, by Alberto Salazar. He was a win at all costs person. It is hurting the sport. You were very close to Alberto Salazar? Yes. How difficult has it been to listen to this? It is really hard. The years, he was a super important person in mY he was a super important person in my life. I literally loved him. I loved him. He was like a father to me. So, it feels like a betrayal, a little bit. And I feel really bad about that. But he put me in this position. I showed the allegations to the chief executive of the World Anti-Doping Agency. You disturbed by what I’ve told you? Totally, not only disturbed but very disappointed. -- ARU disturbed. That is why it needs to be scrutinised by us as an independent body. Alberto Salazar, a consultant for UK athletics the two years, told the BBC the following. -- ARU disturbed -- are you. Galen Rupp said... There is no suggestion that any other Oregon Project athletes, including Great Britain ‘s Mo Farah, have broken any anti- doping rules. But if the allegations about Alberto Salazar are true, then Mo Farah has been coached to world success by a man who has used banned methods. Mo Farah told the BBC that, in his experience, Alberto Salazar and other Oregon Project always strictly followed rules, and that he himself had never used banned drugs. Mark Daly, BBC News. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: The story behind the watch and their role in modern Chinese history. First though let’s round up the stories making newspaper headlines around the world. The japan Times leads again with the pension scandal gripping the government. The paper carries details of how hackers sent a computer virus via email, they were able to steal details from more than a million people. China Daily reports on the rising tension with the Philippines over the South China Sea. It describes the shock in Beijing at comments from the Philippines president comparing China to Nazi Germany. The Pentagon wants Congress to lift a ban on buying rockets from Russia, according to the International New York Times. It was introduced last year in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The paper quotes officials who say they need access to the equipment for a few more years. Finally the Straits Times has a story on a new defence deal signed between India and the US. The 10-year agreement covers joint military exercises and maritime security. This is BBC News. The latest headlines: Chuck Blazer, FIFA’s former top official in the US, has admitted taking bribes related to the bidding process of at least two world cups including South Africa in 2010. The Pentagon admits its scientists mistakenly sent samples of live anthrax to more than 50 different labs around the world including South Korea and Australia. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provocative action, after the worst day of violence in Ukraine for months. Officials in Moscow claim the Ukrainian army shelled civilian areas, in Kiev they claim pro-Russian rebels launched a la rge-scale offensive. The fighting centred on the town of Maryinka, near the main crossing point into rebel territory. From eastern Ukraine, Tom Burridge. On part of the frontline today it at least felt like the war was back on. GUNFIRE. It sounded like it, too. Even though the firing in eastern Ukraine has never really stopped, despite the supposed peace deal, it’s the heaviest fighting we have witnessed in several months. And in a village, just back from the frontline, Sasha, Katya and their young daughter, Anya, take shelter under ground. Ten-year-old Anya says she couldn’t go to school today because of the shelling. TRANSLATION: It’s so scary. I can’t bear to listen. I want it to finish soon. Her mother, Katya, tells us the family have nowhere else to go, so they’ll stay here until the bombs stop. Today fighting raged around Maryinka, a town next to the main check point to cross the frontline. This is a road we’ve travelled down dozens of times over the last few months. It’s a road that civilians use every day to go from government-controlled Ukraine into rebel-controlled territory to visit their relatives or to go to work, but within a matter of hours the dynamic at least in this part of this region has changed significantly. Who controls Maryinka tonight is unclear. Today’s fighting, filmed here by pro-Russian rebel troops, was concentrated in one place but the fear is that things could escalate further and it will test the faith of leaders in European capitals to the west, who are trying to negotiate with Russia for peace. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in eastern Ukraine. It’s twenty six years since the Chinese military rolled tanks and troops into Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, to forcibly remove the students who’d been protesting there. Live rounds were fired, and hundreds of demonstrators died. The Chinese authorities ignored the international outcry and, instead, gave a specially commissioned watch to the soldiers and police who were deployed that day. One of the craftsmen who made them was Xu Yaonan. Here’s his story. TRANSLATION: When you look at a watch, every piece of it is dead and cold. But after being assembled by warm hands, everything comes to life. The Beijing Watch Factory was built by the state in 1958. It was the start of China’s watchmaking industry. For the first time, all the parts of our watches were made here in China. I was assigned to work here in 1962. When I first entered the factory, it was amazing to see all the brand-new machines and young workers. EVâI’yoIâ1â WGS So pI’oUd. Back then, people could only use coupons to buy a watch. It was among the three big items every family dreamt of owning. A watch, a sewing machine and a bicycle. This watch is special. It was ordered by the Mayor of Beijing to commemorate the quelling of the Tiananmen Square riots in 1989. We made tens of thousands of them and they were sent to different army squads and police who had participated in the crackdown. We focused on making these watches really well. All slick and waterproof. It is one of our contributions to society. But we really can’t discuss it. It’s still sensitive. The Tiananmen incident still has a chilling effect when people talk about it. Many died there for no reason. This big order helped us through a difficult period of time. Our watch production was hit badly by the new Quartz watches. We struggled for a very long time. Now I have retired, but I still live in the factory compound and help out. I want people in China to learn about us and ourfirst-class watches, made here in the Beijing Watch Factory. The world’s biggest particle collider is back up and running after a two year shutdown. The huge underground facility which houses the Hadron Collider is buried beneath the Swiss-French border and it’s there that scientists are working to unlock some of the mysteries of our universe. Our Science Correspondent Pallab Ghosh reports. Cheers at the Large Hadron Collider for what the researchers here expect to be a new era of physics. The man in charge had this message for his staff. Thanks to everybody, and now let’s see new physics! But he said that the breakthroughs would not happen immediately. Do not expect it will be tomorrow, don’t expect it will be in a month, be patient, OK? In the corner, a bottle of Higgs single malt whiskey, created in celebration of this moment three years ago. As Peter Higgs wipes away a tear, when researchers discovered the Higgs Boson - the particle that holds the universe together. But what is set to follow will be even more remarkable. It is quite possible that a couple of years from now, we will look back on this moment and say, ""This was the start of our understanding of 21st-century physics."" This was the period when we opened up the door to knowing what the majority of the universe is made of. Not what we happen to be made of, which is the electrons and protons of what we call the standard model, but what 95% of the universe is made of. That will be a huge step forward for our understanding of why we are here and where we come from. Following its upgrade, the LHC is smashing particles together at twice the energy it was before. The development means that from today physicists will be able to see completely new things in the subatomic world. It is as if they have a new microscope with vastly greater magnification. It is a great moment, it is a great emotion. I think this is an arrival point, because people have been working for this for years. The current theory explains how just 5% of the universe works. Researchers hope they will soon find evidence of mind-bending new ideas that involve extra dimensions, invisible so-called super symmetrical particles, and evidence of what researchers call the dark universe. Now, you may have been led to believe sharks are not the friendliest of animals but you may have to think again. In an aquarium on the Pacific island of New Caledonia this worker takes a break from cleaning the tank to give this leopard shark a bit of care and attention. The seemingly placid shark appears to be enjoying itself rolling over and savouring a good scratch and hug. Now, many people have bucket lists which include swimming with dolphins, doing an extreme sport, or smashing stuff up. But this was top of the bucket list of 90 year-old Walter Thomas in Woodstock, Illinois. This was set up for him by his grand-children. Mr Thomas smashed an old truck through the garage doors of one of his family’s homes. The garage was due for demolition and the truck destined for the scrap heap but it all seems to have made one nonagenarian very happy. A reminder of our top story: Chuck Blazer, the top official in the US, has admitted taking bribes related to the bidding process of at least two World Cups. More on that and all the news on the BBC website and Twitter. For many of us, today will be the warmest weather we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will be hotter still on Friday across eastern England with high levels of humidity, bringing a risk of thunderstorms. Thunderstorms already forming across Spain, and that will drift across France over the next 24 hours, the risk on Friday. Overnight, turning chilly in rural areas with temperatures getting down to single figures, towns and cities relatively mild. Plenty of warm sunshine on Thursday, there could be an early morning isolated fog patch, but most will start off clear. We will keep the sunshine into the afternoon as well. A different story further north, Northern Ireland and Scotland will have more cloud than we had on Wednesday, and that will be thick enough to give us a little bit of rain. In the sunshine further south, temperatures will be soaring, 23 or maybe 24 somewhere across London or south-east England and East Anglia. That’s where the real warmth is on Thursday afternoon. Heading into Friday, heat and humidity will build, feeling a little oppressive for some. Temperatures will reach 25 or 26 degrees in the warmest areas. With the heat comes humidity. That combination of heat and humidity is likely to spark some thunderstorms, particularly across parts of eastern England. Storms arriving early in the day may not have too much in the way of heavy rain, but they could have big drops and lots of thunder and lightning. Storms later in the afternoon could be heavy indeed. just to the west of this line of thunderstorms, a slice of dry and brighter weather, still perhaps feeling a little on the humid side. Across south-west England and Wales, into north-west England and Scotland, this is where there will be a cold front, bringing outbreaks of rain. Behind the cold front, skies will brighten up. A fresh feel here. Temperatures in Belfast around 15 degrees. Through Friday night, the cold front sweeps across the British Isles, introducing fresher air. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, bringing with it some blustery showers and strong winds. Feeling cool as well. 12 degrees in Glasgow, England and Wales in the sunshine feeling reasonable and fresher. By Sunday, more of us will enjoy more of that dry and sunny weather as showers become less widespread. The weather improving through the weekend. The latest headlines from BBC News. The USjustice Department has released details of the web of corrupt payments that it says lie behind the FBI investigation into Fifa. Former top official in the US Chuck Blazer, says he and others executives took bribes during the selection of the 1998 and 2010 World Cups. US defence officials have admitted the number of laboratories that were sent potentially live samples of anthrax is more than double the original estimate. 51 facilities in the United States received consignments, as well as laboratories in Canada, Australia and South Korea. So far nobody has been infected. Emergency workers in China searching for survivors after a cruise ship capsized on the Yangtse River have recovered more bodies. 65 people are now confirmed dead. Hundreds more are still missing. Dozens of people broke through a police cordon demanding news of missing relatives. Next Hardtalk and Zeinab Badawi asks Mahmoud jibril, who was head of the transitional council that governed Libya after the fall of Gaddafi, who can save Libya now? Welcome to HARDtalk, I Zeinab Badawi. Libya is in chaos and UN sponsored talks to end the conflict are failing to make progress. Libya has loosely divided into several parts. Two rival administrations based in Tripoli in the West, and Tobruk in the East. Extremists control three towns on Libya ‘s Mediterranean coast, while the South is in the middle of tribal warfare. My guest today is Mahmoud jibril, the head of the transitional council that governs Libya after the fall of Gaddafi. Who can save Libya now? -- I am Zeinab Badawi. Mahmoud jibril, welcome to HARDtalk. How worried are you about your country Libya, and its people? Well, thank you for having me firstly. Firstly, I would say it is a mixture of worry and optimism that the same time. We are heading towards the last round of negotiations, which are supervised by the UN. I think there are too optimistic notes. Firstly, the international community has come to the realisation that there is a real threat that might touch Europe and neighbouring countries in Europe -- two. This could roll in any direction. The second thing, the warring parties in Libya are really tired. Everyone came to that realisation that force does not pay. Everyone should put Libya first, and they have to come to some sort of compromise to get out of this dark tunnel. On what basis do you say that the warring parties are fed up of the conflict? We have two rival administrations, the internationally recognised government in Tobruk, they won the elections injune last year. Then, a rival administration in Tripoli, that was appointed by the old parliament, they did not recognise the election results injune. That is still the situation? Well, there are two elements. Firstly, neither party has enough military power to dominate over the whole country. Secondly, there is a new terrorist element which is Isis. That could serve as a unifying factor between the two warring parts in Libya. I think both elements are working strongly in the minds of everyone in Libya today. So, when we see evidence though as the rivalry between Tilbrook and Tripoli, you dismiss that. For example, when we see the tussle over who controls Libya ‘s oil, you have the National oil Corporation -- Tobruk. They are basically in the hands of someone recognised by the government in Tripoli, but not the internationally recognised government in Tobruk, you brush it aside because you say the common threat of Islamic State, self-styled Islamic State, unites them? I think that is more or less a true statement. There is a new danger in the country that might unify the warring parties. There are other concerns, they might be minimised for the time being at least. When also the Europeans, in particular, say that they are concerned about the threat of ISIL because, as we know, Libya is very near the Italian coast, and there have been some calls from Italy, for example, for airstrikes against Islamic State strongholds in Libya, thatis Islamic State strongholds in Libya, that is what the Italian Foreign Minister has been advocating... Is that something you would back? Well, I think the Italians are starting to take more aggressive steps and more positive steps lately, they are different from, what I would say, five or six months ago, especially after the blizzard the Prime Minister to the US. We started witnessing a more forthcoming approach, -- visit. And more interests by the Italians to take a more active part in Libya and Libyan issues. The other thing is that the neighbouring country, whether Egypt, Tunisia, or in the south, they became very much interested in order to find a solution to the Libyan issue. The issue is that today, the international community owns or controls more than 80% of the parties in the Libyan situation. That is different to one or two years ago. I think some sort of common understanding, a common consensus among all international community members, but enough is enough. Some sort of a solution should be reached. The Libyan fight could touch everybody. But, you know, I will tell you what the Italian Foreign Minister said in April. He says ""we don’t have months and months to sort this out. The double risk and the advance of the Islamic State group in Libya and the waves of migrants means that we are in a race against the clock"". Are you saying specifically that you are leading -- you saying specifically that you are leading-- you, as a leading figure in Libya, I know that you are living partly in Cairo at the moment, ‘the Italians want to do, which is targeted airstrikes? -- back what the Italians. This is a very sensitive issue. I would like to be clear. This is a Libyan cause, and it should be fought by Libyans, no one else. But the international committee, whether neighbouring countries, European countries, they should back up this effort. It should be a Libyan led effort. Otherwise, the other terrorist groups will utilise this fully. They are going to turn it into a sovereignty issue. They will turn it into a wall of Christianity against Islam. This is very dangerous -- war. People should be very careful of this very fine and thin line. That we back up the Libyans, those national fall -- forces. They are looking to unify their country and start rebuilding the civil democratic state. So I take that as a no, then? That you do not want to see more outside intervention? No, no. It is the type of intervention that we disagree on. A direct intervention, this might promote the cause of terrorism in Libya. So not targeted airstrikes? As you know, there’s a big debate going on in Europe. Let me tell you what a former British defence went-- minster said. former British defence went-- minstersaid. He said, of former British defence went-- minster said. He said, of targeted airstrikes on Islamic State strongholds, who would you target and with what? This is loose talk. Do you agree with Admiral West? I’m talking about boots on the ground. All right. But other logistical support and aerial support, intelligent support, that is very much needed for our military capabilities of the Libyan army. We need that. So that we can do something very effective in this war against terrorism, other than that, I would say that everything is on the side of us today. Dash of them today. They have more money, the international community is freezing Libyan assets, but gave them a competitive edge. They have a supply line of weapons, technology, and the whole world community is watching this. Still, supplies are coming to Isis. No one is raising a figure -- finger. International community is serious about supporting the Libyans, so first they should stop the supply lines, and lived any embargo of the Libyan army, and in terms of the Libyan government. We do not have the chance to compete against Isis. Our children are leaving schools today, and joining them, because they are getting big salaries. Why? The Libyan government is not even able to pay the salaries of employees for four months now. That is the Arab acronym for the self-styled Islamic State, Daesh, you are talking about the UN arms embargo, Libya has had that against it since 2011. You want to see it lifted. You say that the extremist groups are better armed. We’ve heard reports about attempts to fight the extremists, like Islamic State, with arms made out of scraps from Second World War armaments. But, what has the international community is said to you, when you say you want this UN arms embargo lifted? -- said to you. They have excuses like"" we don’t know whether those arms are going to be under the control of the army, all given to other terrorist organisations"". They are raising arguments -- or given. Saying that some of the arms given to the Libyan army are sold on the black market. It might be true, but we can have some guarantees. We can have an international community where, by the international community where, by the Arab league and military committee, we can supervise the use of those, and make sure that those arms really go to the Libyan army, and are really used for the fight against terrorism. This is how we can develop, and work out those fears and work against them. The international community, you say that they should help the government. I made that point earlier, which government, in your view, could -- people be back in? There is the internationally recognised one in Tobruk, is that the one you are supporting? That is the one the international community recognises. And you supported? Definitely. -- support it. It is the choice of the Libyan people. I go back to my original point, it is divided, Libya, not only do we have these extremist groups, and, as you say, the Mediterranean coast is a stronghold now for Islamic State, but you have to rival administrations. The one in Tobruk, that you say, you recognise, along with the international community, is relatively weak. So, how do you try and address the internal? -- internal divisions? Well, the weakness of this government is that there are two sources. The first is an intrinsic type of weakness. It is derived from the nature of competence and qualifications in this government. Everyone admits that. But the other type of weakness is coming from the international community, by freezing the assets of this government. So they cannot provide any services. So, how a government can work without money? You made that point, asl government can work without money? You made that point, as I said, the money, essentially, comes from oil. We know that, despite the conflict, Libya and something like $12 million from oil. -- earned. The National petroleum oil Corporation is in the hands of somebody who was actually sacked by the government in Tobruk. A professor in Benghazi said that foreign oil companies have dealt with the National oil Corporation in Tripoli the decades. They will not switch their business now. The government and Burke has no other choice but to accept the status quo. -- the government in Tobruk. Look, there are three assets. Those assets for the Libyan people, not for any government. Neither the government in the east of the West. The Central Bank oil and the Libyan foreign investments. Those are for future generations. Libyans, whether in the east or west, should come to a common understanding, some sort of functional division of labour. Some operations can be carried out for the time being, in the West, and some operations carried in the east. But under one unified frame. Because, those three strategic assets, nobody should tamper with. Not that you store the West. I think the international community should support this -- East or the West. It touches the future of Libya. We are exerting some efforts now, in this area, in this vein. That everything should be unified in those areas, even some sort of division of labour, and we reach a final sentiment. division of labour, and we reach a finalsentiment. Forthe division of labour, and we reach a final sentiment. For the time being, no contradictory or conflicting efforts. There are conflict k efforts in Libya. You emphasised what the international community should do in the community. As a Libyan what should the forces inside the country do? You have got the Prime Minister of the Government in Tobruk, Abdullah al-Thinni saying one thing. You have got the Libyan Dawn military saying one thing. Backed by one of the senior clerics, the whole picture isjust chaotic. What are you saying to these competing forces and saying to them - look, unite, get your act together. What I’m trying to say that those strategic issues should be part of the coming agreement, which is going to be negotiated in Morocco on the 7th of june. Those issues - these are the real issues because what we have been doing so far is talking about a national unity Government. What I’m trying to push hard to make this dialogue more successful is that we should tackle the issues in advance, because just having a national unity government without an agreed-upon agenda, agreed-upon in advance agenda, then this unity government is going to fail. We had a unity government, and we had the unity government during in the past. What matters is we have to tackle the real issues. What is the real issue. OK. But the thing is, are you saying you’re opposed now of a unity government. That is one clear strategy which is being advocated by some, for example, jason Pack from the council of foreign relations. He says in the US, he’s a foreign policy expert, former US official- the Europeans and Americans should end their recognition of the Tobruk government and state clearly they will only deal with a national unity government that emerges from the UN brokered talks. He’s right, isn’t he? What I’m trying to say, just have - any government in the world is a tool, it’s not an end in itself. What matters is what that government can do. And what it cannot do. To have a national unity government without having a clear agenda, the conflicting parties agreed in advance, then that national unity government is doomed to failure. What is clear... What I’m trying to do - the two issues. What is the agenda? First, how we get rid of the weapons. Two: How we get rid of militias. Three: How we rebuild our army, the security should be back on the street. Four: judicial system should be reactivated. Five: National reconciliation for all Libyans, abroad and inside. Libyans should be under one umbrella. Nobody should talk either about September or February. We talk about Libya this time. Fifth: The corruption. The last thing is how to reactivate the economy. The economy can be a solution at this point. We have more than 28 Libyan cities are totally safe, secure. Why the economy is not reactivated there? You have set out a very clear agenda there are where you say must be agreed on by the parties involved. I take it here that you meanjust parties involved. I take it here that you mean just the two rival administrations in Libya. Or are you saying the hundreds of armed groups, militias, and Islamists, loosely associated with Al-Qaeda as we see in Benghazi, all those should be brought into the talks, is that what you’re saying? Everybody should be involved? Everybody should be involved as long as they accept a peaceful resort to the political process, everybody should be accepted as long as he accepts the democratic process. Are you involved, because it could be said to you, Mahmoud jibril, involved, because it could be said to you, Mahmoudjibril, that to you, Mahmoud jibril, that you are one of the key people who emerged in the post-Gaddafi Libya. You were one of the voices that was urging intervention to help remove Gaddafi. Why are you not backing your own country. If you were that concerned, surely you’ll be there playing a principal part. Well, I’m doing that. I’m doing that. My party is heavily involved with, actively involved with, the negotiation, whether it’s in Morocco or Algeria. So we don’t save any effort because we don’t have any other way but a national dialogue. I talk to people extensively. I’m glad they started to develop some action plans, short action plans. So in case this unity government is established, there should be some plans. But what I’m trying to say - those action plans should involve some Libyans in developing them. Some Libyans should be there. Otherwise they’re going to lock at them as -- look at them as something that came out of the planet. People are going to refuse them. I strongly urge I’m glad there are some issues now on the table. We want those issues to be discussed by some Libyans and some international experts should be in the game also. OK. You’re referring there of course to the UN special envoy. I want to just go back to why do you think that Libya is in this situation now? Because there were high hopes after Gaddafi was removed, everybody thought that, you know, things would be a lot better including you yourself. Let me put to you what Sir john Saws, former head of Britain’s MI 6 intelligence services said. After Gaddafi was ousted there was nobody left to hold the ring to help manage the transition to something better, Libya had no institutions intervening has huge rist, and costs. Not intervening also has huge risks and costs. Do you feel those players, the UK, France, the Europeans, left Libya stranded after Gaddafi was removed? Oh, yeah. I remember before - just two days before I resigned, I was in Brussels and I made pleadings speech in that conference - please Libya now is a stateless society. You did the easiest part by destroying the regime. The cuffest part, the most difficult part, is to help us rebuild our institutions. So, please, don’t leave us. And nobody listened. And Europe is now paying a heavy price for not listening. You’re talking about the migrants, the human smugglers who are exploiting the power vacuum in Libya and lots of migrants coming in and the threat of the Islamic State as you said perhaps using Libya as a base. This... All right. So... This is only one sort of threat, you know. Lots of threats, you know, are facing Europe in the coming future. All right. One argument to develop from that is - do you think it was wrong to have removed Gaddafi in the first place? Because of course that’s the Russian position. For instance, presidentialadvisor that’s the Russian position. For instance, presidential advisor said in the past few days that Libya would have been better off if Gaddafi had been left in place. When you see the chaos and violence and suffering now, he thinks Gaddafi would have been better off. I should remind you - 3,000 dead, a third of the population have fled the country. People worried about humanitarian crisis in Libya for those who remain. No, I don’t think so. I mean, dictatorship and oppression cannot be divided. Whether this oppression is during Gaddafi years or whether this oppression is taking place now under those terrorist organisations, those militias. So we should stand up against- we should stood against all types of operation and types of dictatorship, whether it’s during Gaddafi years, or whether it’s taking place right now. That’s why I am raising the issue as a Libyan issue. It’s not an issue of Gaddafi or anti-Gaddafi. This is not the issue at all. It’s an issue of 6 million people are trying to dream of a better life. They have been deprived of everything during Gaddafi years and now they’re deprived more intensely of what’s even the sense of security is not there. justice, security, development, cannot be separated according to different dates. All right. Briefly and finally - the question is when? The British foreign secretary Phillip ma’am Monday said Libya blew up in 2011, it takes years, decades, to rebuilt a -- rebuild a society after a catastrophic event. How soon till we see the end of the violence? I think there’s a sense of exaggeration there. I think we have lots of resources that we can rebuild this country, in no time. What we need is that Libyans love each other. A sense of mutual trust is restored. A sense of believing in our kids and our future is there. sense of believing in our kids and ourfuture is there. If our future is there. If we believe in those three issues, all types of obstacles can be overcome. I’m talking about the demographic explosion of east and west and south, which is going to be a fireball even for Europe if we don’t have real development to keep Libyans and have a special development. OK. We have to believe in Libya as Libyans. We don’t have to believe in others. Mahmoud jibril in Cairo, thank you very much indeed for coming on HARDtalk. For many of us, today will be the warmest weather we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will be hotter still on Friday across eastern England with high levels of humidity, bringing a risk of thunderstorms. Thunderstorms already forming across Spain, and that will drift across France over the next 24 hours, the risk on Friday. Overnight, turning chilly in rural areas with temperatures getting down to single figures, towns and cities relatively mild. Plenty of warm sunshine on Thursday, there could be an early morning isolated fog patch, but most will start off clear. We will keep the sunshine into the afternoon as well.

In the sunshine further south, temperatures will be soaring, 23 or maybe 24 somewhere across London or south-east England and East Anglia. That’s where the real warmth is on Thursday afternoon. Heading into Friday, heat and humidity will build, feeling a little oppressive for some. Temperatures will reach 25 or 26 degrees in the warmest areas. With the heat comes humidity.

I’m Adnan Nawaz. Our top story this hour: Bribes were agreed ahead of the hosting of two football world cups. In court documents, the former Fifa man Chuck Blazer details payments made in choosing the venues for the 1998 and 2010 tournaments. Welcome to the programme. Other stories that we are keeping across for you: The worst outbreak of fighting in eastern Ukraine for months raises diplomatic tensions. Stepping towards a deal- Greece’s Prime Minister says a new agreement is in sight but will the Greek public back it? I’m Sally Bu ndock. In business: Start the countdown - Virgin Galactic tells us they’ll soon be ready for paying passengers despite the fatal crash that threatened to ground the project for good. Plus football’s cash machine - England’s Premier League scores record profits and revenues. Chuck Blazer was once one of Fifa’s most senior officials and in newly-released American court documents, there are details which show the 70-year-old New Yorker and others on Fifa’s Executive Committee agreed to accept bribes in relation to the hosting of the 1998 World Cup in France, and the 2010 tournament in South Africa. These are just the latest revelations of corruption to come out of an investigation into Fifa by the FBI, which is also looking at the awarding of the next two world cups. From New York, here’s Nick Bryant. These are the winning bids that are now part of the FBI’s global dragnet, the US authorities revealing this evening that they’re now looking into how Fifa awarded the World Cup to Russia and Qatar. But a figure at the heart of the investigation is an American, Chuck Blazer, who was not just a Fifa powerbroker, but one of its biggest cheerleaders. I think that Fifa’s doing a really excellentjob of promoting football around the world. If I look back ten years, 20 years and see the progress we have made, I’m very proud of our accomplishments. But for the past three years, this businessman with a love of parrots has been singing like a canary, telling the US authorities what he knows about alleged corruption at the highest levels of the game and acting as an FBI informant who used a microphone, hidden in a key chain, to secretly record meetings. Nate Vinton is the New York journalist who broke the Chuck Blazer story. The IRS and the FBI, an agent from each agency found him on a street in New York and told him that they could put him in handcuffs right there on the spot or he could co-operate with their probe. This evening came the release of court documents detailing his guilty plea in 2013. In them, Blazer says he and others on the Fifa Executive Committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup. He also admitted organising the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup, which ended up being held in France. Hisjet-setting lifestyle included this flight with Nelson Mandela. His online blog - Travels with Chuck Blazer and Friends - reads like a cross between a Panini sticker album featuring all-time greats and the celebrity magazine Hello!. During their meeting at the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin told him he looked like Karl Marx but a former colleague, Mel Brennan, who has been watching this saga closely, says he was a fraudulent capitalist. Chuck was corrupt from the get go. There wasn’t a single relationship that he had in world football that wasn’t about garnering silent wealth onto himself and wasn’t about, as a result, jeopardising the sport’s ability to take care of the most vulnerable. Chuck Blazer spent his millions from racketeering, money laundering and tax evasion notjust on one luxury apartment in the exclusive Trump Tower in New York, but two - the second for the use of his cats. That one alone cost £4,000 a month. Presidents, princes, even popes - Chuck Blazer has met them all, but it’s his relationship with this man, Sepp Blatter, that will now come under scrutiny. Nick Bryant, BBC News, New York. And in the past few hours, the former Fifa vice president jack Warner has made a televised address in his native Trinidad and Tobago. He says he will prove a link between Fifa officials and the 2010 election in his country. He was speaking in a paid political advertisement and said he would no longer keep secrets for people who, he claimed, were actively seeking to destroy the country. Mr Warner is accused of taking a bribe in exchange for helping South Africa secure the right to host the 2010 World Cup. A former government minister, he’s currently on bail in Trinidad and denies any wrongdoing. After the broadcast, he appeared at a political rally with his supporters and repeated his denial of any wrongdoing. It is not true. South Africa did not give me a $10 million bribe. They did not give me a bribe. Russia did not give me any bribe. You can get plenty more background on all the Fifa corruption allegations on our website. Among the features and analyses, you’ll find a detailed breakdown of who is accused of what. The United States has warned Russia that a new outbreak of fighting in eastern Ukraine could lead to additional costs. Moscow in turn has accused Ukraine of provocative actions. The latest confrontations are the heaviest since a ceasefire was agreed in February, with many people reported to have been injured. The fighting has centred on the town of Maryinka, near the main crossing point into rebel territory. From near the town, our correspondent Tom Burridge reports. On part of the frontline it at least felt like the war was back on. GUNFIRE. It sounded like it, too. Even though the firing in eastern Ukraine has never really stopped, despite the supposed peace deal, it’s the heaviest fighting we have witnessed in several months. And in a village, just back from the frontline, Sasha, Katya and their young daughter, Anya, take shelter under ground. Ten-year-old Anya says she couldn’t go to school because of the shelling. TRANSLATION: It’s so scary. I can’t bear to listen. I want it to finish soon. Her mother, Katya, tells us the family have nowhere else to go, so they’ll stay here until the bombs stop. Fighting raged around Maryinka, a town next to the main check point to cross the frontline. This is a road we’ve travelled down dozens of times over the last few months. It’s a road that civilians use every day to go from government-controlled Ukraine into rebel-controlled territory to visit their relatives or to go to work, but within a matter of hours the dynamic at least in this part of this region has changed significantly. Who controls Maryinka is unclear. Fighting, filmed here by pro-Russian rebel troops, was concentrated in one place but the fear is that things could escalate further and it will test the faith of leaders in European capitals to the west, who are trying to negotiate with Russia for peace. Tom Burridge, BBC News, in eastern Ukraine. As deadlines continue to loom for Greece to repay its huge debts, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says a new agreement is in sight. He’s been holding late-night talks in Brussels, where he also said some of the conditions laid down by his country’s creditors would not be acceptable. A payment of 300 million euros is due to the International Monetary Fund on Friday. Without a deal, Greece could go into default. ~ I believe that in a few days, the next few days, we will be closer to an agreement. I believe that in any case, an agreement is in sight but we need to conclude the discussions. Alexis Tsipras was elected on a promise to end austerity, so key to any deal being accepted will be the impact it is has on those who voted for him earlier this year. Our correspondent james Reynolds has been speaking to some of them in Athens. For a single night, the lost generation of Greece gets a break from 5 years of crisis. They are not following their new government’snegotiations minute by minute. When you spend every day on the edge of disaster, you learn to get used to it. We have nothing to loose. Years ago, people my age had something to do. I don’t. This psychology student is planning to move to the UK. To be honest, I would prefer to stay here but it is very difficult. I want to be active with my life and take my life in my hands. Does it make you feel angry that you don’t have the opportunities older people had? I’m disappointed. I have studied my whole life and I cannot do anything here. Some have nothing left. In the last five years, homelessness may have risen by 25%. Despair is hard to measure. The country’s public hospitals don’t do much to raise anyone’s spirits. This doctor has thought about leaving Greece but he feels a duty to his patients. We have the same problems that they do. They know we are giving our best to treat them and to do everything possible for them. That is nice for us, even if money is not good. Greece is now built its own monuments to the economic crisis. Its government blames Europe for its years of austerity. It’s now seeks salvation from the same people it condemns. And Sally is here with all the business news. We start in California’s Mojave Desert where of one of the world’s newest and riskiest industries is being developed: space tourism. Virgin Galactic, owned by billionaire Richard Branson, is battling to perfect its re-useable space plane eight months after a crash that killed one of its pilots and, for some, called the whole project into question. This is the factory in California. Our transport correspondent has been given access to it and he has been talking to the chief executive about when the first paying passengers could be lifting off into space. That is in about 20 minutes. The bribery scandal at football’s governing body Fifa may be dominating the headlines but there’s also some far more positive financial news about the game this Thursday. Revenues are up sharply across Europe’s big five football leagues, with England’s Premier League leading the way. That’s according to an annual report by consultants Deloitte. It shows the clubs in the Premier League had a record year for both revenues and profits in the 2013-14 season. They made record revenues of over £3.25 billion, which is up 29% on the previous season. Why are they doing so well? 2013-14 was the year of a new broadcast deal but top clubs are also keeping a lid on wages, handing less of their earnings to players than they have in previous years. 58% of revenues went on wages, down from 71% the pI’âVioUS VEBI’. That’s the lowest wage to revenue ratio in 15 years. We will also have all of the other business news including a look at Greece. See you soon. In other news, scientists meeting in London today will warn that rising CO2 emissions from mankind are set to cause huge damage to the oceans over the next 50 years. The meeting at the world-renowned Royal Society will hear that the oceans are going to soak up more CO2 from the atmosphere and become steadily less alkaline. Some species like seaweed may benefit from the changes but others such as corals will be devastated. The controversial Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders says he plans to use a party political television broadcast to show cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Mr Wilders made the announcement after the authorities refused permission to exhibit the cartoons inside the Dutch parliament. The pictures were first shown at an event in Texas last month, which was targeted by gunmen. Thousands of people have filled a plaza in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires in protest at violence against women. A series of murders has shocked the country, including that of a primary school teacher killed in front of her class by her estranged husband. Argentina has adopted laws against domestic violence but campaigners say they aren’t being implemented effectively. More bodies have been recovered in what’s looking likely to be China’s worst boat disaster in decades. 456 people were on board the Eastern Star cruise ship when it capsized on the Yangtze River on Monday night, local time. Search teams have just got into a third part of the Eastern Star cruise ship. So far, 65 bodies have been recovered and only 14 survivors rescued. The vessel was travelling from Nanjing to Chongqing when it went down injianli County during a storm. Our correspondent Celia Hatton is following developments from Beijing. Is this third part in the hull, where they had been hearing sounds? The rescue was identified three spots on the hull of the ship where they thought air pockets might exist. They have cut into two of the spots and only found dead bodies, no survivors, so they are now cutting into that third and final spot and really, that is the final hope that they might find any survivors. We have not heard any word yet from the rescue site if they have had any luck but... It has been difficult for rescue crews, who have been dealing with very heavy rain and low visibility in the water. There are more than 200 divers going underneath the water in an effort to find bodies or survivors and they are reallyjust working with their hands because they cannot see anything. From the very beginning of the disaster to now, this recovery process, there has been a lack of information which is making it not only difficult for people to follow the progress but also making people very upset as well. Absolutely. The relatives of the missing are becoming more and more anxious and very angry indeed with local government officials. We have heard of a couple of protests, one in Shanghai and one much closer to the site yesterday, where relatives were trying to push for more information and they were literally pushing through lines of paramilitary police in one instance, trying to get to the rescue site. They have been promised a visit to the rescue site today, Airbus visit, but they say they are still not getting any information. -- a visit on a bus. They have not had any answers to the questions they are asking: Why the vessel was allowed to sail in such weather, why there have only been 14 survivors and why most of those survivors are crewmembers, the Caxton, the chief engineer. They are asking why these people were able to save themselves but did not issue an alarm or distress call that the ship was in trouble.

Eastern Ukraine has seen its fiercest outbreak of fighting since a peace deal was signed in February. With tensions over Ukraine rising, and Western sanctions beginning to bite, some of Russia’s educated middle-class are opting to move abroad. In 2013, the number of people leaving Russia jumped 40%. The emigres include economists, scientists, journalists and IT specialists. It’s being described as a brain-drain. From Moscow, Caroline Wyatt reports. Summer in SUITIITIEF iI’I Moscow, B Summer in Moscow, a city that still feels more prosperous and more at ease with itself than it used to. Despite the sunshine, many worry. Plentiful economic opportunities are drying up as sanctions like, with a society more and more split between the majority you support the President, and those who fill Russia is on the wrong part Belmokhtar, who dream of a more liberal country.

She too is planning to emigrate. What she hoped for a broad? TRANSLATION: Stability probably, provided by the rule of law. The matter who is the President, today or tomorrow. Stability so normal people like me can live in peace and stop worrying. Over the past few years, the Russian middle class has doubled in size to around 40% of the population, but some are now predicting that will shrink over the next few years to just 30%. For some of the most educated and highest skills will leave. It is what some call a new Russian brain drain. Of course, all countries that lose their best minds suffer. This is notjust a brain drain, there are people who did business or worked in finance, and they were the first to run for the West, so we have had an outflow of capital in the last two years as well. Forthose capital in the last two years as well. For those who see themselves as true Russian patriots, like the pro-government demonstrators of the national liberation movement, the professionals who are leaving are traitors to their country. Normal citizens here feel the rise of Russia. Especially after the return of Crimea. Many people want to move here, so those traitors who want to leave, I want them to wake up and remember their fathers and grandfathers, who fought for the motherland to the bitter end, to build the biggest, strongest country in the world. The numbers leaving may be small, but many of them are the very people Russia can ill afford to lose. Live anthrax was mistakenly sent to more than 50 laboratories across the United States and three other countries. The number is more than double the original estimate.

As the academic year in the United States and Europe draws to a close, many students are already thinking about what they’ll be doing when the new one starts in September. A growing number of Americans will be taking advantage of the free tuition available at German universities. More than 4000 are already doing so, and as Franz Strasser reports from Germany, there’s also something in it for the host nation. Universities are free of charge in Germany. For German citizens and for everyone else. Thousands of Americans have heard the call and have enrolled overseas. This man made the -- made the move last year, firstly because he had never been out of the US. I heard things like I would be able to drink much I would have healthcare, I would get an education. My main motivation was saving money. There are about 35 students sitting listening to this in English. That is important because if the university president has his way, within five years every course will be offered not just as well as in English, but exclusively in English. His mother is happy because he can pay for everything without having to take on any lines. Each month it costs about 600 euros to live here. Food, phone, jim, rent, everything. In the capital, Berlin, the top destination for US students, it is agreed that the university education should be right, a privilege. Keeping international students who have studied in the country is the ideal way to have migration, because they don’t have a language problem at the end of this day, they have certificates, which are needed. Catherine is one of those already paving Catherine is one of those already paying back into the system. After finishing her masters degree last year, she is still in Berlin, living in a hip neighbourhood and working for a German start-up. I could have gone, but there is some sort of comfort here. There are so many young people, all believing that Berlin is this sort of dream world where everything is possible when you graduate. A country worried about an ageing population not charging young foreign talent could prove to be a smart, long-term strategy. Coming up injust a couple of minutes, Sally has all the latest business news in World Business Report. First a look at the weather where you are. For many of us, today will be the warmest weather we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will be hotter still on Friday across eastern England with high levels of humidity, bringing a risk of thunderstorms. Storms are already forming in the humid air across Storms are already forming in the humid airacross Spain, humid air across Spain, and will be driven across France in the next 24 hours before reaching perhaps eastern England as we head into Friday. Overnight tonight we will have some pretty low temperatures out in the countryside. Towns and cities staying mild, 13 degrees in London. The best of the weather and the sunshine, it will feel a bit warmer than it the sunshine, it will feel a bit warmerthan it did warmer than it did on Wednesday. The amounts of rain a fairly small, a little on the cool side. A glorious day, keeping the sunshine for most of the morning. Early isolated fog patches will clear away readily, and temperatures could peek around 23 or 24 degrees. It will be hotter than that still, by Friday, but those humidity levels really peaking. For some it will begin to feel oppressive, that combination of heat and humidity is likely to spark thunderstorms across eastern England. We could see a batch of storms moving in during the morning, perhaps not very much rainfall but 20 of thunder and lightning. The storms could turn heavy in the afternoon, and to the west of those storms there will be a slice of dry and brighter weather, storms there will be a slice of dry and brighterweather, perhaps and brighter weather, perhaps still a little on the humid site, and across western areas cold front will bring outbreaks of rain. That will move into Scotland eventually, and behind that is where the fresh air is. As we had through Friday evening and overnight, the cold front will push away to the continent, taking the humidity with it. A fresher feel to the weather, but still feeling on the cold side. England and Wales will have reasonable weather. Most of us will have a dry day with bright and sunny spells. This is BBC World News. The headlines: Court papers have been released in which the former Fifa executive Chuck Blazer says he and others on the executive committee accepted bribes in connection with the choice of South Africa to host of the 2010 World Cup. Heavy fighting has broken out in eastern Ukraine between government forces and pro-Russian rebels. It’s one of the worst breaches of the four-month ceasefire. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of provocative action. The Greek Prime Minister says an agreement over the country’s debt crisis is in sight after late-night talks with European partners in Brussels. Mr Tsipras said Greece and its creditors were now very close to a deal. Emergency workers in China searching for survivors after a cruise ship capsized on the Yangtze River have recovered more bodies. 65 people are now confirmed dead while nearly 400 more are still missing. Those are the latest headlines from BBC World News. Now for the latest financial news with Sally and World Business Report. Football’s cash machine. England’s Premier League scores record profits and revenues. We start in California’s Mojave Desert, where of one of the world’s newest and riskiest industries is being developed: space tourism. Coming up: China’s IPO fever. We take a look at the wave of company flotations this week. Now, in California’s Mojave Desert , Virgin Galactic, owned by billionaire Richard Branson, is battling to perfect its re-useable space plane eight months after a crash that killed one of its pilots and, for some, called the whole project into question. Our transport correspondent Richard Westcott has been given access to Virgin Galactic’s factory and has been talking to its chief executive. He sent this exclusive report this is Virgin Galactic’s brand-new spaceships. You can see it still has the carbon fibre body exposed. Even to the untrained eye you can see this has a long way to go until it will be flying. Here in the middle of the Mojave Desert is the mothership going through maintenance at the moment. The spaceship is underneath it and will drop down, fire a rocket and then go up into space, in theory. You are the boss of the company and this is your new spaceships. But this is a long way from flying, isn’t it? How long will it be before people get inside that and go on one of these journeys? I think sooner than you might think. We have to finish manufacturing of this vehicle and, actually, it is closer than you might imagine. We have a few more months to work on this vehicle before we begin testing the vehicle again and then what we will do is take the time we need to get through the test flight programme to make sure the vehicle is as safe and successful as we needed to be. But you are under pressure. You have an initial promise to get into space by 2008. Lots of deadlines have slipped and you have only got up to 70,000 feet when you need 350,000. Can you understand white sceptics look at this and say it is a great vision but it will not happen? -- why some sceptics. We have some of the best technicians and pilots here who have come to dedicate their life to something that is new and it is hard. It will always be difficult. But I believe this is an amazing team that will get it done. This is fundamentally the same spaceship that crashed in the desert. What can you say to reassure people it is actually safe? Well, spaceflight will always have its risks but we have used the latest technology as well as created a simple vehicle to make something that we think will be able to be repeatedly used for safe operations. Months or years before people go up? We will begin a test flight programme within months and that will be a big milestone. There could be people in there, we hope, within 18 months or a couple of years? I’m not going to give specific dates because I don’t want to put too much pressure on our engineers but what I will say is that we are relatively close. The bribery scandal at football’s governing body Fifa may be dominating the headlines but there’s also some far more positive financial news about the game this Thursday. Revenues are up sharply across Europe’s big five football leagues, with England’s Premier League leading the way. That’s according to an annual report by consultants Deloitte. It shows the clubs in the Premier League had a record year for both revenues and profits in the 2013-14 season. They made record revenues of over £3.25 billion. That was up 29% on the previous season. So, why are they doing so well? Well, 2013-14 was the first year of a new broadcast deal. Top clubs are also keeping a lid on wages, handing less of their earnings to players than they have in previous years. 58% of revenues went on wages, down from 71% the previous year. That’s the lowest wage-to-revenue ratio in 15 years. Danjones is lead partner of Deloitte Sports Business Group. At last, we are seeing the sort of results we have wanted to see four years from Premier League football clubs. Absolutely. We have been doing this for over 20 years and I have in doing it for 15, personally. Revenue growth is a great measure of success in terms of marketing the game but it has not matted from a business profitability perspective because as revenue goes pâI’SpâCtiVâ because GS I’âVâIâ1Uâ QOES up, SO perspective because as revenue goes up, so does wage payment. That is why these results are so transformational. For the first time in 15 years, the Premier League clubs are making a pre-tax profit and in terms of operating profits, for every £100 coming in, they make £19 of operating profit, which is transformation from where they were before. It is a turning point. They got to the point where they had to make a change. It was getting ridiculous. These clubs were relying on Whiteknights of Russian oligarchs, to bail them out. Three things have happened. First, they have more revenue coming in from the television deal they did with Sky and BT. That has brought in revenue. In the past, they have spent that on wages. Now, they have Financial Fair Play rules that have forced them to put a break in things. And there is also a collective feeling in the boardrooms that enough is enough. We keep being so successful in generating revenue, we have to turn it into a profit. What about championship football? They pay a lot of wages still. Absolutely. Because of the success of the Premier League, everyone in the championship is looking to get there. All football clubs want to win and get promoted and win titles. But in trying to achieve that, they find themselves financially overstretched and they are all competing hard and for every £100 they get, they spend £105 on wages before any of the other costs. The football league is now following suit along from Uefa has done and what the Premier League has done and is tied to bring in some cost control measures. We will watch that space for the next couple of years because that is the next thing they need to turn that around a bit. Thank you. Good to have some good news. To Asia now and it’s IPO fever for Chinese companies with 23 selling shares to the public on the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets this week alone. Rico Hizon has been keeping a track of them. Companies in the mainland are indeed very aggressive, looking to cash in on this one up in the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets. One of the biggest offerings is Legend Holdings, which is looking to raise as much as $2 billion from US investors. Other companies include China National Nuclear Power. This flood of IPO claims will lock up a total of over $1.3 trillion. Big, mainland firms want to take advantage of this window of opportunity. We already know that China has the highest level of corporate debt in the world. Chinese companies are increasingly tapping into the equity markets for money to repay their debt and increase growth. They are taking advantage of the current market to do so as investor appetite for new listings continues to be strong. Market watchers say there is no bubble in the markets with money flowing in major waves. Chinese mutualfunds major waves. Chinese mutual funds raised major waves. Chinese mutualfunds raised about $130 billion during the period between january and raised about $130 billion during the period betweenjanuary and May period between january and May and thatis period between january and May and that is money looking for a home. The market has also gained encouragement from the signs that the central bank will continue to ease interest rates. Thank you. Quickly looking at the financial markets. Mario Draghi’s comments about inflation on the euro. And a quick look at how things ended in the US. Greece is stilla major factor. We will talk about that in a few minutes. A new law making it easier for Britain’s security services to access phone and internet records must be rethought. That is according to two MPs, who will both argue that the Data Retention and Investigatory Power Act was rushed through and thatit Power Act was rushed through and that it clashes with data protection law and the right to a private and family life. Lastjuly, a cross parliamentary agreement saw the Data Retention and Investigatory Power Act become law in only days after a ruling by the European Union’s court ofjustice that existing powers were illegal. The law prevents Britain’s security agencies and other public bodies together information about who contacts contact -- suspects contact by telephone or e-mail. The two MPs said the legislation was rushed, lacked adequate safeguards and must be rethought. They are supported by a civil liberties group, Liberty. People have to understand just how personal this information is that will be taken and retained and what an intimate picture of their life it can create. There is very little evidence to suggest thatjust by giving the police even greater loads of information about people they don’t even suspect of giving -- committing crimes it will make their life any easier or theirjobs easier. It is not. Their challenge comes as the Home Secretary drafts even more controversial proposals dubbed the sleepless charter. -- sleeper’s charter. It would allow law enforcement to get more information about how criminals, terrorists and others use the internet and social media. Coming up, allthe Coming up, all the day’s news, business and sport. Breakfast will be looking at why the head of Tesco is trying to tackle food waste and turnaround the company’s fortunes. This is BBC News. The headlines: Chuck Blazer has admitted taking bribes relating to the bidding process of at least two World Cups, including South Africa in 2010. Heavy fighting has broken out in eastern Ukraine, the fiercest outbreak since a ceasefire deal was signed for months ago. The Greek Prime Minister says a deal over his country’s debt crisis is now very close. Emergency workers in China searching for survivors after a cruise ship capsized on the Yangtze River have recovered more bodies. 65 people are confirmed dead and almost 400 others are missing. Now it is time for our news review. In the past few hours the former FIFA Vice President jack Warner has said he’ll come clean on corruption within the organisation. The sports website ESPN FC reports Warner has apologised for not discussing the issue earlier and that he now fears for his life. There’s just a day to go until Greece needs to reach an agreement with its creditors. Meetings between the two sides went on until late on Wednesday night and when someone tweeted Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis to say he couldn’t sleep before he knew what was going on. Varoufakis replied telling him to go to bed! Implying that he thought the deal was fairly close... , possibly, or go to bed because there won’t be any news for a few hours. Greece is in the papers too, the business front page of the International New York Times is reporting that a breakthrough is looking possible. Meanwhile in the Financial Times, the OECD has urged the UK’s Chancellor to slow up on spending cuts, highlighting how austerity measures might affect the poor. The International New York Times reports that the Pentagon is pressing Congress to overturn a ban on buying rocket engines from Russia. Officials say they need the equipment to launch American satellites into Space. And finally, Rafael Nadal has been knocked off the top spot at the French Open. The nine-time champion was beaten in the quarter finals by Novak Djokovic who will meet Andy Murray on Friday. joining us isjane Foley, a Senior Foreign Exchange strategist at Rabobank. Good morning. There are so many different angles to the Fifa story, and now we have a massive political one. At least massive politically for Trinidad & Tobago. jack Warner says he will come clean. This is a man with significant political ambitions, and he is saying he will come clean, he no longer wants to hide that corruption. You could look at it from a different angle, should we be pointing the finger at him? This isn’t about foot all any more, it is about greed, corruption, politics, perhaps nepotism, and really over the next few months we will be able to see finally how far the net can be cast in drawing in all of this corruption. I think one of the things many people are saying is that Sepp Blatter is under the spotlight more than anyone else, but how much is it his fault? Any massive sporting organisation comes with years of tradition, and he inherited something from a resilient, who has regarded himself to not be completely above board. When people are doing business underneath you, you can’t always be responsible for everybody. OK, the buck may stop with him and he has resigned, but he may not have known anything. He may not, and we will discover that. anything. He may not, and we will discoverthat. I discover that. I think it is only right that the person at the helm of the ship takes responsibility and walks away and allows for a clean slate, for us to realise exactly what has been happening. That wasn’t his stance, because he went for re-election and when he was re-elected he was defiant about his position as president of Fifa. Something happened between that re- election and yesterday. Some people think there could be a smoking gun with the FBI investigation. I suppose what I’m trying to get that is that there is a technicality in the Fifa structure, in that the executive committee, many members are given to him. If they come to him, elected by other confederations, not by him, how much is it his fault? What are we talking about in terms of its financial influence, Fifa, in terms of the money that can be made when it awards tournaments? Absolutely huge. If we think about a tournament in a developing country like Qatar, think about the inward investment that comes with it. Notjust the direct investment from Fifa, but that from other companies. Infrastructure goes up, that generally brings jobs, Infrastructure goes up, that generally bringsjobs, it generally brings jobs, it brings other companies in to use the infrastructure afterwards. The impact can I want for years, so it isa impact can I want for years, so it is a significant economic boost to the company. It is difficult to estimate how much they would be worth, but it is huge, much more than the initial investment from just stadium. And Qatar’s stock market is already falling after it they announced that Sepp Blatter was stepping down. It looks close, it is all off, this is about the deal in Greece. We are beginning to think at least part of this, with respect... The euro is still riding high. There hasjust been a lot of positive headlines keeping us on the brink of expecting that we will get something soon. We have been here before, but certainly we have known that there has been a game of brinkmanship all year, that there would probably be another general election. We know they have to go to the brink before making concessions, and similarly fully Europeans. We know from their point of view that they can’t give in to Greece easily either. We are perhaps in the 11th hour, we may be for some while, but it does appear we have to have something happened. We are talking about Greece, austerity, and to what extent a cut. In the FT, the OECD, which has been backing George Osborne’s way of handling the economy, it is saying perhaps you are going too far. With respect to the UK, what we were told in the last budget was that we needed to have £30 billion worth of savings before the next election, £12 billion perhaps in welfare, and a lot of it outlined in thejuly budget. That is a lot. But there is this general mood swing in Europe, we have seen it in France and Spain, against austerity. Posterity was the usual description we have seen in Europe against the crisis. We need to get our budget deficits organised, but in fact there is a bit of a backlash. People have been suffering for a long time, wage growth is low, costs are higher, maybe this isn’t the way to go. In Greece, we saw a movement towards the Socialist far left, we have seen that also in Spain, and maybe... They are not saying austerity is long, they are just saying you have gone far enough. Yes, and it is really to ease the pain of the working poor, more than anyone else. £12 billion on welfare, talking about that amount of parts. In the International New York Times. There are still deals being done by the US and Russia despite the hold over Western sanctions on Russia, and this is about Russian rockets. It is worth bearing in mind that the US and Russia still co-operate in terms of space exploration. They still work very closely together, because that is the way it has to be. It is too inefficient not to do that because of the amount of money and investment that is needed. These aren’t rockets is in weapons, they are rockets that help ring intelligence satellites into orbit. It was only five months ago that the law was passed to say that the US cannot use these rockets any more, and the Pentagon is going, we need them. This is a broader argument about sanctions. We know the west has put sanctions on Russia, but there has always been some counter sanctions as well. Russia is talking about easing some of those counter sanctions on food to ease their prices. You insisted on talking about Rafa Nadal. Have you got a bit of a crush on him? E is nice to look at, but Rafa Nadal Ijust felt it was a significant loss for him yesterday. Straight sets, at Roland Garros, where he... I think it is the second time he has lost in 71 games. He is very QBTTIES. He is VâI’y YOUTTQ, He is very young, he is not even 30. He was 29 yesterday. It is far too early to say that it is the end of his career or anything. He early to say that it is the end of his career oranything. He has his career or anything. He has been in the final every year, year on year, and... We are sitting here in a studio saying he is young, but for a professional sportsman he is not that young. Up against Murray or Djokovic. My wife said to me, Rafa Nadal could do it. I said, he has no chance! I love him, but sorry. Novak Djokovic, sorry Andy. For many of us, today will be the warmest weather we have seen for at least a couple of weeks, if not longer than that. It will be hotter still on Friday across eastern England with high levels of humidity, bringing a risk of thunderstorms. Thunderstorms already forming across Spain, and that will drift across France over the next 24 hours, the risk on Friday. Overnight, turning chilly in rural areas with temperatures getting down to single figures, towns and cities relatively mild. Plenty of warm sunshine on Thursday, there could be an early morning isolated fog patch, but most will start off clear. We will keep the sunshine into the afternoon as well. A different story further north, Northern Ireland and Scotland will have more cloud than we had on Wednesday, and that will be thick enough to give us a little bit of rain. In the sunshine further south, temperatures will be soaring, 23 or maybe 24 somewhere across London or south-east England and East Anglia. That’s where the real warmth is on Thursday afternoon. Heading into Friday, heat and humidity will build, feeling a little oppressive for some. Temperatures will reach 25 or 26 degrees in the warmest areas. With the heat comes humidity. That combination of heat and humidity is likely to spark some thunderstorms, particularly across parts of eastern England. Storms arriving early in the day may not have too much in the way of heavy rain, but they could have big drops and lots of thunder and lightning. Storms later in the afternoon could be heavy indeed. just to the west of this line of thunderstorms, a slice of dry and brighter weather, still perhaps feeling a little on the humid side. Across south-west England and Wales, into north-west England and Scotland, this is where there will be a cold front, bringing outbreaks of rain. Behind the cold front, skies will brighten up. A fresh feel here. Temperatures in Belfast around 15 degrees. Through Friday night, the cold front sweeps across the British Isles, introducing fresher air. Low pressure to the north of Scotland, bringing with it some blustery showers and strong winds. Feeling cool as well. 12 degrees in Glasgow, England and Wales in the sunshine feeling reasonable and fresher. By Sunday, more of us will enjoy more of that dry and sunny weather as showers become less widespread. The weather improving through the weekend.

60,BBC1 London,4-jun-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,40 mins,True,"At war with itself. Fifa goes into meltdown as another senior figure threatens to dish the dirt on others. Former Vice-President jack Warner says he fears for his life, as he threatens to lift the lid on corruption and reveal all. As the Fifa crisis deepens, calls for a re-run of voting for the next two World Cups in Russia and Qatar. We’ll be getting the latest developments live from Fifa’s headquarters in Zurich.

Uf’ldâiâ [JFESSUFE. The Prime Minister makes a new appeal to abandon plans for a 10% pay rise for MPs. A report from Virgin’s test base, Galactic’s where they’re hopes rebuilding commercial space travel. Following on from last year’s crash, I have come to the desert in California to take a look at what Virgin hopes will be their latest spacecraft. 100 years ofjam, cakes, and campaigning, The Prime Minister congratulates Crossrail workers who’ve finished tunnelling under the capital. And brace yourself for some stormy weather. Elizabeth will be here with the forecast. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. It’s an organisation that looks as though it’s about to tear itself apart. After one Fifa official, Chuck Blazer, admitted taking bribes, now its former Vice-President jack Warner has said in a dramatic TV address that he will tell investigators everything he knows about corruption at the world football body. Warner, one of the 14 people charged by the US over alleged corruption at Fifa, says he fears for his life, but says he will reveal all. As the Fifa crisis deepens, questions too about whether the next two World Cup venues can go ahead, without a re-vote. Let’s go live now to Fifa HQ in Zurich and join Christian Fraser. No sign of Sepp Blatter so far today, although there are various routes into this complex. If he is behind his desk he is surely reflecting on another damaging set of revelations from people he would once have considered his friends and Allies. The investigators are pulling the strings and there’s a ball of corruption is beginning to unravel. How many other figures are caught up in it? Does it go beyond the 14 people indicted by the FBI last week? To call Chuck Blazer a larger than life character would be a gross understatement. As one of world football’s leading power brokers he revelled in the limelight. He only travelled first class and stayed in five star motels and enjoy being photographed with presidents and royalty. Fifa’s dirty secrets have been exposed. In 2013 he said... South Africa deny they ever paid a bribe. jack Warner, who worked closely with Chuck Blazer, is said to have been the recipient of that money. He is set to launch an avalanche of claims as he fights extradition to the US in connection with racketeering and bribery charges. I no longer keep secrets for those people who seek to destroy the image. This is the hotel in the centre of Zurich when last Wednesday those dramatic dawn raids took place that barked this the recent crisis. It was also the venue for where Fifa executives were lobbied by nations who wanted to host the 2018 and 22 World Cup. Russia and Qatar prevailed but there are questions over those decisions. Fifa insist both tournaments will go ahead. Qatar insists it has done nothing wrong. Russia remains defiant also. TRANSLATION: Sepp Blatter is the president or Fifa and has almost been tamed -- president or Fifa and has almost been tamed -- always maintain good relations with Russia. No resignations can affect the award. If Russia hosts the World Cup in 2018 it seems very unlikely that another European country would host it in 2022 but if fever came forward and asked us to consider hosting it we have the facilities and we mounted a very impressive if unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 World Cup -- unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 World Cup -- Fifa. Previous and future World Cups are under scrutiny, threatening Fifa’s leadership and possibly future viability. The wind of change blowing through the corridors of power shows no signs of abating soon. jack Warner had some interesting things to say. 28 years on the executive committee in Zurich. He is cornered. There is an extradition request from the United States. Everything has to be sat in that context. He is fighting for his freedom and his reputation. Nonetheless, you willjudge from what he has to say but potentially he has some pretty explosive material. Threats there. Warner said that he had been derided and ridiculed. He said that he could stay quiet no longer. The former Fifa vice president has been named as being at the centre of this $10 million payment, something the FBI described as a bribe. Speaking in a five-minute political broadcast that he paid for on local television in Trinidad and Tobago, jack Warner looked straight down the camera. He mentioned the Fifa President Sepp Blatter by name. He said, ""the documents I have deal with certain transactions that include Sepp Blatter"". jack Warner said he had given these documents to his own lawyers. He said that these documents outlined the link between Fifa, its funding and himself. He said that he could prove a link between Fifa and the 2010 elections in Trinidad and Tobago. jack Warner said there can be no turning back. The 72-year-old former Fifa Vice President is facing extradition to the United States. jack Warner told people here that he now feared for his life and he said that he placed his trust in the people of Trinidad and Tobago. We are back to the lack of transparency in Fifa funding. Not just football, but into politics, and a general election in Trinidad and Tobago. The most interesting bits of the jack Warner statement or the bits we could not see. Presumably they conceal the names that the FBI are looking at. That is the next stage of this investigation. Some of the biggest names in British athletics have been expressing their concern at the doping allegations surrounding the world famous athletics coach Alberto Salazar. An investigation by the BBC has uncovered allegations that Mr Salazar was involved in banned doping practices, allegations he strongly denies. He is one of the biggest names in athletics coaching, responsible for the stellar career of a British world-beater. An investigation by the BBC uncovering allegations that Alberto Salazar was involved in banned doping practices with the man who finished second to Mo Farah in the 10,000 metre final has caused outcry in the athletics community. Alberto Salazar denies the claims. There is no suggestion Mo Farah has broken any anti-doping rules. Fellow athletes are concerned. If I found that I had a coach or training partner that was facing these allegations I would run a mile. I would not want to be associated with people with such serious allegations. In a separate part of the investigation, the journalist proves that the most up-to-date way of catching drug streets, the biological passport, could still be passed with banned substances in his system. Those watching last night were worried, with some of the best-known names in British athletics taking to social media. Those who work to catch the cheats admits they have a job on their hands. The number of violations that we have continues to grow every WE have COI’1tiIâ1UâS to gI’oW âVâI’y YEBI’. we have continues to grow every year. What we strive to do is to balance a very intelligence led targeted testing programme with a robust education programme. It is about informing athletes of their rights and responsibilities and the implications if they choose to work and are caught. The BBC is aware of staff associated with a project which Alberto Salazar heads up -- dope. They say they have spoken to the anti-doping agency about these allegations. In the meantime, questions will remain over whether Mo Farah should question the company he is keeping. Let’s speak to our sports correspondent, Matt Slater. Considerable reaction to these claims. Mo Farah is arguably the headline act of the Birmingham Grand Prix on Saturday. His event is the last on the track. This meeting has attracted most of the biggest British names as well as international athletes. Mo Farah was supposed to join the British athletes in a media conference in Birmingham tomorrow. He is holding his media conference on Saturday instead. He has told the BBC he has never broken any rules and has never witnessed any wrongdoing at his US training camp. Neither was it suggested that he had in the programme. That training camp in the US is funded by Nike which has reinstated its commitment to clean sports. The coaches strongly deny the allegations. Alberto Salazar is also a consultant for UK athletics. The governing body said it welcomed the investigation and would reflect on its findings today as well as re-emphasising its zero tolerance on doping. David Cameron is calling for the organisation that sets pay for MPs to think again about its plan to increase the level by 10%, to £74,000. A number of MPs have said they will not take the increase being proposed by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. Let’s speak to our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith. The Prime Minister under some pressure and growing concern about this pair rise. David Cameron is in a bit of up political mangle. Although it is nothing to do with politicians any more, it has been handed over to Ipsa, you just know people are going to have steam coming out of their years at the thought of MPs getting a pay rise to take them to £74,000. It makes it harderfor David Cameron take them to £74,000. It makes it harder for David Cameron to sell his message of public sector pay macro "" PGY message of public sector pay macro -- pay restraint. It is becoming increasingly party political because the opposition parties are seeing if we get the pair rise we will give it to charity. -- we get the pair rise we will give it to charity. -- pay. Before the election we heard from the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond the end that he could not accept the rise and Michael Gauld said they could stick the pair rise -- and Michael Gauld said they could stick the pair rise -- Michael Gove. Ipsa say they will only revise their opinion if there is new and compelling evidence. Privately, many MPs think they are worth the pair-- PGY MPs think they are worth the pair-- pay rise because there might have lost out to comparable professionals, so they want to take the right,. -- professionals, so they want to take the right,. -- the rise. Either of Cameron is going to get mangled by a Parliamentary or public backlash. The authorities in China say the operation to raise the passenger ship which capsized on Monday will start this afternoon. 360 people are still unaccounted for. 75 bodies have been recovered. Many relatives of those on board are angry with the government’s response. From the scene, our Beijing Correspondent, Martin Patience, sent this report. Grief, anger and frustration is growing among the relatives of the missing. Desperate for any news, they broke through police cordons, close to the scene of the accident. With the government providing almost no access, this grieving family asked us to take them to the site. We agreed to help. For this person’s daughter, it was an agonising journey. We passed through checkpoints that have turned relatives back. Then... Grief on the banks of the Yangtze River. Often -- off in the distance the cranes marking the final resting place of a mother and a wife. This person loved cooking and travelling, her family tell me. TRANSLATION: Until now we have no idea what’s really going on. We have no information at all. We come here today, to have a look by the river. Look is all we can do. just offshore, teams of rescuers are cutting holes into the stricken vessel. And slowly they are pulling out more bodies. Most relatives now know that those on board are not coming back, but they do want answers. Our top story this lunchtime. More senior figures at Fifa have threatened to reveal details of alleged corruption at world football’s governing body. And still to come: Are we living in a Big Brother state? Two MPs go to court to argue that surveillance powers have gone far enough. Coming up in sport at half-past, world number one Serena Williams is bidding to reach her third French Open final. She plays a Swiss in the semifinals at Roland Garros. It’s eight months since Virgin Galactic’s space plane crashed in the Californian desert- killing one of the pilots, Mike Alsbury. Now one of his colleagues, who witnessed the accident, has spoken to the BBC about what happened. Dave Mackay was flying just behind the spaceship when it broke up. He’s told our transport correspondent, Richard Westcott, that despite the tragedy the team is still determined to realise the dream of commercial space flight. And we can cross to Richard now, who’s in the Mohave Desert. Hello, this is Virgin Galactic HQ. We are in the middle of the desert. The wind is howling outside. Inside you really get a sense of this project, this incredibly ambitious projects. This is the mothership, which drops the spaceship before it goes off into space. That brown object over there is the spaceship. Virgin’s new spaceship. That’s what we’ve come to see. Barren and unforgiving. 70 years ago these same desert skies heard the first aircraft breaking the sound barrier. Emerging in a hangar, Virgin Galactic’s attempt to make new history. After the shock of last year’s crash, they’re trying to rebuild. And here is the new space ship. They actually began building this a couple of years ago and it’s fundamentally the same as the last one. It’s got the same carbon composite body, but you can see it’s not anywhere near finished yet. The structure is done, we are told, but they are now putting in the electronics. It’s going to be the end of the year before they even begin testing this. We can’t actually show you inside because it’s restricted, but there’s not that much to see, no cockpit controls. But the first passengers were meant to be floating in space seven years ago and even now the boss won’t commit to a launch date. What we’re doing is not easy, right? It’s a historic thing and the reason it hasn’t happened over the last 100 years is because it is hard. OK, so could there be people in there, you hope, within 18 months or a couple of years? I’m not giving you a specific date because I don’t want to put pressure on the engineers engineers, but what I want to convey is we’re relatively close, so we don’t have five years to go, or anything like that. I know it looks like a computer game but this is real. A successful test from 2013. It shows just how dramatic the Virgin ride would be. But cutting edge technology is risky. Eight months ago the first spaceship broke apart after one of the crew pulled a lever too early. It looks like this one in the simulator. Co-pilot Mike Alsbury was killed. His colleague, Dave Mackay, was just a few hundred feet away in the aircraft that had just launched the rocket. Speaking exclusively to the BBC he told me about the day. That shock and sadness, we all knew him well so there is a sad side to it to get over, then you have to look forward and we feel positive about the future and we feel that we owe it to people like Mike Alsbury and others who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the past to make this succeed. Virgin says it’s made some changes but insists the rocket ship design is fundamentally safe. The company is under pressure, but maintains this dream in the desert will still come true. It is slightly surreal place here. There are 400-500 engineers here, who have given up nice jobs in cities, to work on this project. That crash had a huge impact on them. They know each other very well. What they were all keen to stress is they are ready to go again full stop they don’t have to change the design of the spaceship. They made a few little changes, but not fundamental changes, and they are keen to get testing again. They hope by the end of the year that thing will be going again. There’s still no sign of a deal between Greece and its international creditors on restructuring its debt repayments. Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has called the economic reforms being demanded for more funding ""unacceptable"". Let’s speak to our Europe correspondent, Chris Morris, who’s in Brussels. Time is running out, isn’t it? Time is running out, money is running out. Greece hasn’t received international loans since August of last year. The coffers are pretty much empty. Until those loans restart again, Greece is running on empty. To get those loans moving again, to get more money in the coffers, Greece needs to agree on a series of economic reforms. The Prime Minister came last night and met the President of the European Commission and the man who runs the euro group, which is the meeting of Eurozone finance ministers. They presented a final offer, but he has rejected it. He said, we cannot agree to the rises in VAT you are suggesting, we cannot agree to the cuts in pensions you are suggesting. We have come to a non-pass and its prime -- it’s possible Mr Tsipras could be back in Brussels tomorrow for another meeting. In the last few minutes the chancellor George Osborne has announced it will remain -- which the government will sell its remaining 30% stake in Royal Mail. He said another £3 billion would come from departmental savings. Adult social care firms are struggling to hire, retain and train staff because of cuts to council budgets. According to the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, councils in England are facing a shortfall this year of over £1 billion. But the government says the comments ignore changes that will see health services ""joined up"" with social care. Our social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan has more. Hello, joan. Good social care enriches, enlivens and comforts, but it costs money, and for years councils have frozen the fees they pay for care. Now senior officials admit that policies have created financial problems for care companies, making it harder for them to hire, retain and train staff. The owner of this care home recognises the difficulties. Good quality care is about great buildings and good food, but predominantly it’s about the people who work in care and you need plenty of people, well-trained, and plenty of time, so when funds are very tight it’s the workforce cost that has the biggest impact. Despite the problems today’s report says more cuts are coming. Social care budgets will be reduced by around £1 billion this year. That means over £4.5 billion has been cut since 2010. We’re now saying very clearly if you look forward the consequences for councils, for the NHS, but most crucially of all for individuals needing care and support, gets significantly worse unless the government acts in the forthcoming spending review. Take that cup with us. Ministers say they are providing extra money, billions more, for people to be looked after at home, not in hospital, but much work remains. Usually my mother would be able to walk up the stairs. This woman’s mother is in hospital after a fall last week. My two friends who were taking her upstairs for me one evening, she just completely fell in a heap. 93-year-old joyce was told by her council in March she could get a stairlift but delays meant she got injured before it was installed. My mother hasn’t really demanded the money as such because she doesn’t have a care package, because I do all the care for her, so the fact that the first time I really asked for a major piece of equipment, it’s not really forthcoming at the speed at which she needs it, it’s really frustrating. With sharp rises in demand and falling budgets, social care needs new ideas to create a harmonious future. It’s the first Thursday in the month and for many women across the UK that means their monthly meeting of the Women’s Institute. It’s 100 years since the first branch was opened on Anglesey, to encourage women to grow and preserve food to ease the food shortages of the First World War. Today, it has 212,000 members in more than 6500 Wls - and this morning the Queen attended its Centenary Annual Meeting at the Royal Albert Hall. Sangita Myska reports. Was with spontaneous cheers and applause that the Queen was today greeted by members of the WI. Accompanied by the Countess of Wessex and Princess Anne, Her Majesty was obviously touched. A WI member herself since 1943, the Queen opened today’s centenary AGM by speaking about the continued relevance of the organisation. In 2015 it continues to demonstrate thatit 2015 it continues to demonstrate that it can make a real difference to the lives of women of all ages and cultural backgrounds. In the spirit of friendship, cooperation and support. The image of the WI will forever be associated with turning £12 million of fruit into jam, to help aid the war effort during World War II. But the first WI, founded in Anglesey, was a formidable practical force bringing education to poor women living in rural areas. education to poor women living in ruralareas. Fora nonpolitical organisation it is backed revolutionary campaigns including voting rights for women, revolutionary campaigns including voting rights forwomen, demands voting rights for women, demands for equal pay, and better information about sexual health. More recent campaigns may not have gained the same profile but the commitment of current volunteers is unquestionable. These are just some of the 212,000 members that the WI has. It’s a figure that some political parties in Britain would find enviable. But the organisation says it isn’t resting on its laurels. It is seeking to diversify its membership and attract younger people as well. Does it bother you that the WI may have a frosty, dusty reputation? Not at all, these days we are not frosty and dusty. I can assure you. We are very up-to-date. And glamorous. Well, I don’t know, I’ll let others be the judge of that. While perceptions of the WI continue to change, what has remained constant is the Queen’s 73 year commitment to the work of the country’s largest women only voluntary group, as president of the Sandringham WI she continues to attend meetings everyjanuary is both have mother and grandmother did before her. It has this support that has won her the affection of members so clearly on display today. You’re watching the BBC News at One. More senior figures at Fifa have threatened to reveal details of alleged corruption at world football’s governing body. In a moment, we’ll have the weather - plus the news where you are. But first with the sport, here’s Hugh Woozencroft. Andy Murray admits he’ll have to ""up his game"" if he’s to beat Novak Djokovic in their French Open semifinal tomorrow. The Scot saw off David Ferrer in four sets to book his meeting with the World Number one. Murray is in good shape, unbeaten in 15 matches on clay this year. It’s going to be extremely difficult, I know that. I have to look at the positives of the last weeks, I’m playing way better tennis than I was this time last year. Physically, Ifeel much better. Me and Emily will chat and come up with the best game plan possible, and go out there and try to execute it as best we can on Friday. It’s women’s semi-finals day at Roland Garros, with Ana Ivanovic against Lucie Safarova, followed by favourite Serena Williams. The two-time champion is up against Switzerland’s Timea Bacsinszky after brushing aside the challenge of Sara Errani in the quarterfinals. Williams needed just over an hour to beat the Italian, losing only four games. A BBC Sport survey has found that more than 40% of elite sportswomen in Great Britain have experienced sexism, but only 7% have reported it. The anonymous questionnaire was sent to 568 women in almost 40 different sports. Asked why sexism wasn’t reported, one athlete said she believed it could affect her selection chances. It appears Dick Advocaat has done a U-turn and will remain as Sunderland manager. Last week, he said he wouldn’t be staying on at the club, having secured their Premier League status with one game of the season to go. The former Rangers boss is now likely to sign a one year deal. David Smith, a former Paralympic rower, has defied the odds, fighting his way back to fitness twice after surgery to remove a life-threatening tumour. Now he faces a new challenge, at the Road Cycling World Cup in Italy. jenna Hawkey has been to hear his incredible story. David Smith was born with club foot but that did not stop him competing for Great Britain at Bobsleigh before switching to rowing. Within five months he was world champion but his dreams were crushed when a scan revealed a the size of a tennis ball in his spinal-cord. When I came round from the surgery my body felt as if it had been hit by a truck. I was paralysed from the neck down. I could move my right arm and that was about it. Within two hours my first thought was, I need to get back in a boat. London is only two years ago. Within one year he was back on top of the World Championship podium. Before going on to realise his dream of Paralympic gold. For some, gold in one Paralympic sport would be enough. David wanted a new challenge. He swapped his boat for a bike and started out on the road to Rio de janeiro. I wanted to close the chapter on the tumour and I came home and found the bike and found what I had been searching for my whole life. I do not think about anything to do with my health. I feel great on the bike. It is the only time I am not in too much pain. Last summer he received the news that the tumour had returned. I burst out crying. They said you have the one in five chance of survival. You might die. I came round from the surgery and the first question was, what do I need to do to get back on mY what do I need to do to get back on my bike? The pain when you are on the bike is so much nicer than the pain when you are lying in hospital because the pain doing sport makes you feel alive. That’s all sport for now. Now, how many times do you think you have been caught on a CCTV camera today or had your mobile phone monitored? If you’ve been to work or out to the shops, there’s a strong chance someone’s been keeping an eye on you in some way, and today two MPs are bringing a legal challenge saying surveillance powers have gone far enough. Our legal correspondent Clive Coleman has more. Arriving at court, political adversaries joined in a legal challenge. Last july a cross- party Parliamentary agreement saw the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act become law in days after a ruling by the European Union’s Court ofjustice rendered existing powers unlawful. The law allows the Home Secretary to order communications companies to retain data including emails, calls and text, even confidential ones to MPs, for 12 months. This doesn’t include their content, but the fact they were made and who made and received them. The information can be accessed by the security services here at MI6 and other public bodies. Half a million requests are made each year. Everyone knows that the country needs to be made safe and we need to give our intelligence and security services the right to challenge criminal networks and terrorist networks. The way this legislation came through did not give people the protections they deserve. It is incredibly unusual for MPs to try to challenge Parliamentary legislation here in the courts. Normally they do it in Parliament. They say this law was rushed through at such speed that there simply was not time. This is the only option to protect people’s privacy. We have to challenge it in court order to make sure that the government puts right the lax access, the widescale collection, and indeed the use of the data. Today’s challenge comes as the Home Secretary drafts even more controversial proposals, dubbed the snooper’s charter. This legislation would allow huge amounts of information to be gathered on how terror suspects, criminals and others use the internet and social media. If today’s case succeeds it will have a bearing on that. Many places starting with lots of sunshine, particularly for England and Wales. For Northern Ireland and Scotland we have thicker cloud and outbreaks of rain. The best of the sunshine further south across England and Wales. The rain is shifting further northwards so we should see a little bit of sunshine developing for eastern parts of Northern Ireland and eastern and southern Scotland. Still quite wet and cloudy across northern and western areas. Plenty of sunshine for England and Wales. Strong june sunshine with temperatures of 21, 22, maybe 23. As the night wears on we will start to get humid air which will spark thundery showers. Friday starts warm and humid. We could see the rest of thundery downpours which could be intense with torrential rain and frequent lightning, but not all areas will see it. Temperatures will rise across central and southern and eastern areas. Further west, brightness through the Midlands before this weather front starts to move on from the west. Very little rain, but conditions brighten up behind it. Northern Ireland and Wales writer. Some of that getting into western Scotland. -- brighter. Wet across eastern Scotland. The weather front continues to Maeve eastwards, eventually pushing out the Warren and humid air-- warm. This low pressure will come into play for Scotland and Northern Ireland through the weekend, bringing windy weather. Much of the country should be settled with sunny spells. This is the picture for Saturday. The northern half of the country is windy with outbreaks of rain for Scotland. The best of the weather is towards the south. On Friday the winds begin to ease across the north. Stilla winds begin to ease across the north. Still a few showers around. The best of the weather for England and Wales. A mixed weekend. It is not looking that bad. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: More senior figures at Fifa have threatened to reveal details of alleged corruption at world football’s governing body. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. threatened to reveal details of alleged corruption. That is all from Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Katharine Carpenter. The £15 billion Crossrail project has reached a major milestone with the completion of tunnelling work underneath London. The Prime Minister and the mayor congratulated construction workers in Farringdon this morning. They’ve drilled 26 miles through the capital and the line will open in 2018. Borisjohnson used the occasion to renew his call for Crossrail 2 to go ahead. We need to mount an absolutely overwhelming case to the Treasury that all this talent, all this skill, all this expertise, needs to be transferred immediately upon completion of this heroic task to what? Crossrail 2. Do we need Crossrail 27 Yes, we do! A primary school teacher from South London says his life was turned upside down after he was falsely accused of writing racist graffiti on a wall. The untrue allegations about Thomas Turnham spread quickly on social media. He’s considering legal action. ""A wall of hate,"" is how Tom describes what he had to face, and all because he was wrongly accused of being a racist online. As the volume and magnitude of those messages came through, the realisation of what was happening hits you and it’s totally paralysing. You don’t know what to do. You don’t know, you’re totally lost and it’s bewildering. You’re left speechless, dumbfounded and helpless. Tom’s problems began last week when racist graffiti was daubed along this wall of this cafe and bar in Herne Hill. It’s since been removed, but within just 24 hours the first posts appeared online accusing him of being responsible and from there it very quickly spiralled out of control. Within an hour he was receiving death threats. It got so bad the police told him to move out of his flat, which is above the bar. As he was away in the Lake District at the time they ",,

We have to bring spending down so our country lives within its means, and as with any challenge, the sooner you get on with it, the better.

A pilot Tonight on BBC London: David Cameron and Borisjohnson go underground as tunnelling for Crossrail is completed. And as the number of cyclists in London reaches an all-time high, claims that the number of serious injuries has fallen. Good evening, and welcome to the Six 0’Clock News. Billions of pounds of savings are being brought forward by the Government in a new plan announced by the Chancellor in the Commons this afternoon. George Osborne said it would help Britain live within its means, and also announced that the Government’s remaining stake in Royal Mail would be sold. Labour says it shows there is panic in the Treasury. A government that is just in the Treasury. A government that isjust under a month old has delivered cuts, or what it likes to call savings, in defence spending, £500 million, justice, £2li9 million, the non-school is part of education, Âli50 million, among other things. Austerity rolls on. Getting on with what we promised, reducing the deficit, that is how you deliver lasting economic security for working people. When it comes to living within your means, the sooner you start, the smoother the ride. It sounds as though any semblance of a longer-term plan has been ripped up, we have got panic in the Treasury. George Osborne announced ili.5 billion is being raised this year, but that is a deceptive number, because at least 2 billion will come from one-off asset sales, and some of the other sailing things -- savings are also one-offs. It leads to billion pounds, a down payment on the £30 billion the government has promised to find by 2018. There is money in those letters. The churchjury is 2018. There is money in those letters. The church jury is selling its remaining Royal Mail shares. The £1.5 billion likely to be raised from the sale of the Royal Mail stake may sound like a lot of money, but it is a drop in the ocean of the government’s £1.5 trillion national debt, and it is also a cheque that is posted to the government only ones. The efficiency savings should yield catch year after year. He has tough targets to meet, he is looking for 30 billion of cuts from the unprotected Whitehall departments over the next three years, and ten or 12 billion of cuts from Social Security. It is a small down payment on a big challenge for the next few years. The question for one new backbencher is whether the cuts are consistent with the Prime Minister’s pledge to govern for the whole country. I would urge him to follow through on his one nation rhetoric. For us on this side, at every turn, we will hold this government to account for what it is living up to its own test. One nation in spirit and deed. If that is where the battle ground of politics lies in the years ahead, I welcome it, and I look forward to playing my part. The front line of a new war on waste, but the supposedly easier phase of austerity may have been the last Parliament. Future cuts may require hard choices on which services the public sector should actually provide. Billions of pounds of savings brought forward, but this is just the beginning. Yes. The Conservatives were elected on a manifesto promising to take £30 billion out of government spending in 2016 and 2017. George Osborne has brought some of those savings further forward. brought some of those savings furtherforward. There further forward. There are several reasons. If you spread them over three years, it makes it easier for Whitehall to cope. Politically, it means a bit more of the pain a bit earlier in the parliament, while the Labour Party focus on finding a new leader. The Chancellor wants to show people he is cracking on with his plans to try and cut the deficit. But this is just the start, we are talking about relatively modest amounts of money. Most departments say they can find these savings through administration savings, cutting consultancy fees, less on travel expenses. My favourite is a well cut research into’. But next month, we have got a budget, and later in the year a Spending Review, and that is when we will learn the real pain of Ulster ready, the £12 billion of welfare cuts that the government has promised, and we will not be talking about efficiency savings, it is real money, public money that fewer people will receive. The impact will be greater. One of the key figures at the centre of the crisis which has engulfed football’s world body, Fifa, has said he will reveal all about alleged corruption at the organisation. Fifa’s former vice-president jack Warner, who’s been charged with corruption by the FBI, has said he will release an avalanche of evidence relating to Fifa’s financial transactions. He said they included those of its president Sepp Blatter, who resigned this week and has denied any wrongdoing. Defiant and ready for a fight. jack Warner is at the centre of a bribery scandal. He had this message to the world. I will not stay quiet at age 72. I will not stay quiet to allow them to deprive me of my freedom. The former fever vice president told his supporters he was innocent and he is now ready to tell all. I have compiled a comprehensive and he tailed series of documents. This high, documents, bills, speeches, e-mails, I have it here. He is battling for his freedom. It began with this broadcast that he paid for on local TV, with a warning to fever and Sepp Blatter. He was once HE WGS OFICE OFIE of He was once one of football’s most powerful figures, He was once one of football’s most powerfulfigures, he powerful figures, he helped bring David Beckham and the England team to Trinidad in 2010. His fall has been dramatic. He no longer has the influence to attract the big names to his hometown, but he says after three decades at the heart of Fifa he is ready to reveal its secrets. He was first elected to the executive in the 1980s. He led the football Confederation presenting the Caribbean, North and Central America. He was suspended by Fifa and gave up his role in international football. In 2013, the Confederation found he was fortunate in his management of it. And now, the once vice president is facing pressure like never before. ~ I say to you tonight, the avalanche is gone. Many in Fifa will be wondering if his threats are real. It is extraordinary what has happened to Fifa in less than a week, where does this leave them? Tonight, they have said that Sepp Blatter is starting the path to reform here. That is before he prepares to leave office. Increasingly, more people are asking if they can exist in the future, so tainted has its repeat nation become. When you think it cannot get any worse, somehow, it seems to do so. In the last 21+ hours, the endemic corruption and greed at the heart of it has been laid bare like never before. Those confessions of tried taking by Chuck Blazer, then jack Warner promising an avalanche of secrets. Today, the government said it was prepared to step into host the 2022 World Cup if it was taken away from cat. If allegations of corruption were proven. Tonight, the Irish FA have confirmed they received a payment from Fifa after they missed out on a World Cup place, as a means of avoiding legal action. It adds up to a picture of an organisation that is gradually unravelling, tearing itself apart before our very eyes, and this is two days before the Champions League final, when the focus and attention should be on football, it continues to struggle with the biggest sports scandal of all time, perhaps. Officials in Calais say they’re struggling to cope with a huge influx of migrants trying to get to Britain. The numbers in the town have leapt from 200 at the beginning of last year to june 2015. Many are so desperate to cross the Channel, they are attempting to board lorries in broad daylight. They used to wait for nightfall. Now, Calais’ stowaways choose their hiding places in broad daylight. Under the noses of the border police. But the sunshine also makes them easier to spot. Police have made 19,000 of these discoveries so far this year. Last year, it was 8,000. Calais’ battle with its migrants is becoming a routine d8I’ICâ, EVEFI B QBITIE to SOITIE. And a new fence, donated by Britain, is doing little to help. Every day, the migrants and the border guards converge here to wage their battle of attrition. They have installed a double razor-wire fence on this side to stop the migrants coming in, but the new camp is on this side, and there’s nothing to stop them. The UK is due to fund a second fence. The number of migrants in Calais has surged from 200 at the start of last year to around 3,000 today. Sala arrived from Sudan two months ago. He has already tried 25 times to cross the Channel. 25, yeah. Two, five. I don’t worry about the police, he says. What can they do? What would make you stop? Nothing, he says, even the prospect of death. As long as I’m alive, I will keep trying. Alongside the ferry terminal, trucks stand with their doors wide open. This driver tells us he has found migrants inside eight times. TRANSLATION: We keep the doors open to show the migrants there is nowhere to hide, and nothing to steal. It’s a huge problem. They are never far away from the truck. Fences, border checks, open trucks. How do you police people who have lost their fear but not yet their hope? A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories. Officials in Ghana say at least 96 people have been killed in a fire at a petrol station in the country’s capital, Accra. Many of the victims were seeking shelter after being left homeless following two days of heavy rain. Ghana’s president described the loss of life as catastrophic. Alton Towers has confirmed that an ambulance wasn’t called until 11 minutes after the rollercoaster accident on Tuesday which left four people with serious injuries. The theme park will remain closed for a third day tomorrow as experts continue their investigation. Downing Street will make a fresh appeal to the members of Parliament’s pay watchdog to abandon plans for a 10% pay rise for MPs. A number of senior politicians say they will give the money to charity instead. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she’s not losing sleep over the prospect of a British exit from Europe. In an interview with the BBC, she said she believed a solution whereby Britain remains in Europe was very possible. And she added that that solution could include changes to current EU treaties. She has been speaking to our Europe editor. Yes, Angela Merkel is the most powerful woman in the world and the EU’s most influential leader. It is extremely rare to get one to get one-to-one time with her. She was very friendly, taking time to chat to us about how much she is looking forward to the Queen’s visit here this summer. But she has serious issues on her mind, she is about to host the G7 summit and says she is worried about Russia’s meddling in Ukraine and the war in Syria, but the EU is a priority for her. She was resolute today, she wants Britain to stay in the EU. Last week David Cameron was in the chancellery here in Berlin and this week it was the Oueen’s turn. Europe’s most powerful leader has been sounding upbeat about getting a new deal. But would it be enough to persuade British voters to say a clear yes to the EU? TRANSLATION: We have to find a solution that is good for us and good for the people of Britain. Some of the things David Cameron is asking for, I can support. On other issues, our views differ. We’ve always managed to pursue a Europe of different speeds, to agree on opt outs. I don’t lose sleep over it but this is about hard work to create the necessary tree conditions for Britain to stay in the EU. But will treaties be really changed? If that is really necessary then we have to think about it. I’m very optimistic that if we want it, we can find a good solution. The Chancellor would not be drawn on whether a deal would be made giving the parliament a veto... Angela Merkel sees herself as a friend of Britain. But make no mistake, this country has invested the last 60 years in the European project and the German Chancellor will only act on what she believes are the interest of her own country and the EU as a whole. That may not always match what Britain wants. The time isjust after quarter The time is just after quarter past six. Out of story this evening. Spending in education and defence will be Later on BBC London: A living nightmare - how a teacher fought to clear his name after untrue allegations went viral.

The first paying space tourists should have blasted off seven years ago. But the Virgin Galactic service was delayed and then last year it suffered a major setback when its spaceship crashed during a test flight over the Mojave desert. Now one of the pilots involved in the crash has spoken about the tragic accident for the first time. Our transport correspondent Richard Westcott is in California. It has just It hasjust gone the morning here, in the Mojave Desert. Believe me, outside the sun is blazing, but it is inside we came to see, inside that shell over there is virgin Galactic’s new spaceship. Not only did they lose a colleague and a friend but they lost time as well in a project that has seen deadlines come and go. They say the work continues on that spaceship now. The body is ready, the insides are going in, and they gave us a look. Barren and unforgiving. 70 years ago these same desert skies heard the first aircraft breaking the sound barrier. Emerging in a hangar, Virgin Galactic’s attempt to make new history. After the shock of last year’s crash, they’re trying to rebuild. And here is the new spaceship. They actually began building this a couple of years ago and it’s fundamentally the same as the last one. It’s got the same carbon composite body, but you can see it’s not anywhere near finished yet. The structure is done, we are told, but they are now putting in the electronics. It’s going to be the end of the year before they even begin testing this. We can’t actually show you inside because it’s restricted, but there’s not that much to see, no cockpit controls. But the first passengers were meant to be floating in space seven years ago and even now the boss won’t commit to a launch date. What we’re doing is not easy, right? It’s a historic thing and the reason it hasn’t happened over the last 100 years is because it is hard. OK, so there could be people in there, you hope, within 18 months or a couple of years? I’m not giving you a specific date because I don’t want to put pI’âSSUI’â OI’] oUI’ âI’1giI’1ââI’S, to put pressure on our engineers, but what I want to convey is that we’re relatively close. We don’t have five years to go, or anything like that. I know it looks like a computer game but this is real. A successful test from 2013. It shows just how dramatic the Virgin ride would be. But cutting edge technology is risky. Eight months ago, the first spaceship broke apart after one of the crew pulled a lever too early. It looks like this one in the simulator. Co-pilot Mike Alsbury was killed. His colleague, Dave Mackay, was just a few hundred feet away, in the aircraft that had just launched the rocket. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he told me about the day. That shock and sadness. .. We all knew him well, so there is a sad side of it to get over, but then you have to look forward and we feel positive about the future. We feel that we owe it to people like Mike Alsbury and others who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the past to make this succeed. Virgin says it’s made some changes but insists the rocket ship design is fundamentally safe. The company is under pressure, but maintains this dream in the desert will still come true. Fascinating talking to Dave there. But everyone here keeps saying to me is that yes, they’ve had their problems and setbacks, they know this is incredibly difficult technology but they are certainly determined to make sure that that spaceship lies. Some of the biggest names in British athletics have expressed concerns surrounding the world-famous athletics coach Alberto Salazar. He denies doping claims. He is one of the biggest names in athletics coaching, responsible for two of the sport’s biggest stars. He is Olympic silver medallist Galen Rupp, and he is the best-known reddish face in Olympic running, Mo Farah. There is no suggestion Mo Farah has broken any anti-doping rules and both Salazar and Rupp deny the allegations. Infact, today they slammed the allegations. Rupp insisted the allegations were not true and with no evidence, calling it inexcusable and irresponsible journalism. Those who make it their life’s work to catch drug cheats in sport were making it their top priority. We are always concerned when someone has these allegations, but we must they are only allegations. They have to be proved and they have to be investigated and somebody has got to get to the truth. So where do the sponsors come into this? This is the flagship Nikme Oregon project, -- into this? This is the flagship Nikme Oregon project, -- the Nike Oregon project. Galen Rupp is one of their poster boys. They released a short statement saying they take the allegations very seriously and do not condone the use of performance enhancing drugs in any manner. When Galen Rupp took silver behind Mo Farah in 2012, it was Alberto Salazar’s biggest triumph. The allegations against Salazar have made some in the sport are big questions about the future of track and field. When I was a young athlete with a longer career ahead of me, I would seriously question if I wanted to give the next ten years or so of my life up to a sport where I wasn’t sure it you could actually prevail and succeed without using performance enhancing drugs. What of Mo Farah? He said he had seen no evidence of doping at the Oregon project, but on Saturday at a press conference in Birmingham, it will be hard for him to sidestep questions about his close links to Salazar and the methods his courage might have employed to guide athletes to glory. -- his coach. The Swedish furniture giant, IKEA, has promised to spend a billion Euros on combating climate change. It says 600 million Euros will be invested in low carbon energy, and the rest will go to help communities worst affected by global warming. A second batch of letters written by Prince Charles to ministers has been released by the government. They cover issues including alternative medicine, plans for eco-towns, the environment, architecture and housing. One letter reveals that ministers were taking ""very seriously"" his concerns about control of the weed ragwort. They’re famous for calendars, cakes and campaigning, and today the Women’s Institute is celebrating their centenary. The Queen, who is herself a member of the voluntary women’s organisation, attended a special meeting today at the Royal Albert Hall to mark the event. Sangita Myska was there. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. It was with spontaneous cheers and applause that the Queen was today greeted by members of the WI. A member herself since 191+3, she opened today’s Centenary AGM by speaking about the continued relevance of the organisation. In 2015, it continues to demonstrate that it can make a real difference to the lives of women of all ages and cultural backgrounds. The first WI, founded in Anglesey, was a formidable practical force, bringing education to poor women living in rural areas. For a nonpolitical organisation, it backed revolutionary campaigns, including voting rights for women, demands for equal pay and better information about sexual health. These are just some of the 200,000 or so members of the WI here in the UK. It is a membership list that many political parties would be hugely envious of. But they are not going to rest on their laurels. The WI realises that if it wants to stay relevant for the next 100 years, it must diversify the kind of people that it attracts. Well, I’ve been in the WI for 26 years. And jeany’s WI has not long started, three years. And they are called the Iron Maidens, and that is a heavy metal... So you can’t get any more with it than that! Also in good spirits was the Queen, who decided to tease the expert bakers at the WI by pretending she could not cut through a particularly dense fruitcake. It was a small glimpse of the humour and unwavering support she has shown her fellow members over the last 72 years. Sangita Myska, BBC News, at the Royal Albert Hall. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Helen Willets. It has been a lovely day for parts of England and Wales. Not the same story unfortunately further north across Scotland we have been stuck under parts of cloud in Northern Ireland as well. That is a weather front and that will change the julie to the west. At the same time we are drawing in warmerairto to the west. At the same time we are drawing in warmer air to the south. There is an increasing risk of some thundery showers. What it will be as much warmer overnight, particularly in the South. Fine weather is being squeezed out from the West and the South. That weather front is introducing brighter skies to Wales and Northern Ireland. This warm air engages with the higher temperatures we have seen today. Tomorrow there could be some severe thunderstorms and torrential downpours, not everywhere, most likely east of the meridian where we will see the highest temperatures. Some of the rain affecting the Midlands and northern England. That weather front ushering in contrast on whether to today, 13 or 11+ across Wales with some sunshine and simile so across parts of Northern Ireland and western Scotland. Particularly for the Orkneys and Shetland, it does not look like a particularly nice day, only10 not look like a particularly nice day, only 10 degrees again in that rain. That rain is therefore a wee while longer, as we go through Friday night and into Saturday. Wendy for a time to start the weekend. It is an improving picture actually. We lose the heat as that cold weather front pushes that weather front out of the way. The winds in the North will be easing by that stage. Some strong sunshine but still chilly enough by nightfall some ground frost. Warnings have been issued for the thunderstorms, more on that online. That’s all from the BBC News at Six. Tonight on BBC London News: The boring work is over. Crossrail marks a major milestone as David Cameron and Borisjohnson finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. It makes me very proud, as your Prime Minister, to be here to congratulate you on this immense feet. Now the Mayor calls for a new north-south cross-London rail link - but will it ever be built? Also tonight: The number of serious injuries involving cyclists falls as the number of Londoners taking to two wheels reaches an all-time high. of wearing glasses. And the Chelsea pensioners awarded France’s highest military honour. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Alice Bhandhukravi. It’s taken three years, and today the Prime Minister marked a major milestone for the multi-billion Crossrail project, with the completion of tunnelling work beneath the capital. David Cameron was joined by the Transport Secretary and the Mayor to inspect the work at Farringdon. By 2019, commuters will be able to travel through the city from Reading in the west to Shenfield in the east. Borisjohnson used the opportunity to call for Crossrail 2, as our Political Editor Tim Donovan explains. The final breakthrough came at Farringdon, joining the east tunnel to the west, and for the Prime Minister, it wasn’tjust an engineering triumph. It’s also been a greatjobs challenge. 55,000 jobs, just in the construction of Crossrail. It’s been a great skills challenge, and I think you can be incredibly proud of surpassing your target in terms of apprenticeships and training. 1+50 apprentices so far, of which 1+0% previously were not in employment, education or training. You’ve given people skills and hope and a chance in their life, and I think that’s fantastically exciting. Crossrail will run from Reading in Berkshire, through the capital, out to Shenfield in Essex. So that’s the tunneling done - 26 miles of it. Eventually, there will be ten new Crossrail stations, and the whole project is due to cost just short of £15 billion. It will increase London’s transport capacity by around 10%, but that will still barely keep up with demand and population growth, which is why the mayor appealed now for a north-south Crossrail. We need to mount an absolutely overwhelming case to the Treasury that all this talent, all this skill, all this expertise needs to be transferred immediately upon completion of this heroic task to what? Crossrail 2. Do we need Crossrail 2? Yes, we do. Thank you very much, everybody. Well done. So where’s all the earth and mud going? 3 million tonnes of spoil. Well, a lot of it to this nature reserve in Saltmarsh near Southend. What we’re creating here is Europe’s largest intertidal habitat creation project of its type. It’s one of the largest in terms of area, but it’s certainly the largest in terms of land-raising, so it’s going to provide a range of different habitats, notjust for the birds, but for a whole range of invertebrates, plants, the whole gambit, really. It was a Labour project pushed through by Ken Livingstone and Gordon Brown, but their successors stuck with it, and they’re now witnessing it getting closer and closer to completion. So, Tim, Crossrail appears to be on track. What about the prospects for Crossrail 2, a north-south London rail link? If it is in this has-been going. There haven’t been many problems. If few archaeological discoveries, skeletons, etc, to get round, but it is leading people to focus on the future, as the mayor wants, and emphasising a London does not stand still. The population is growing at a considerable rate, and the capital needs more. So the question is, what signals and signs could be coming from government? David Cameronjoked about Borisjohnson taking the opportunity to make a spending bit. Chancellor George Osborne, before the Chancellor George Osborne, before the election, indicated there could be something coming soon. I think we are at the stage where people will feel fairly disappointed and even let down if there aren’t some firm proposals are put forward a second Crossrail from southwestern or these later in the year. Lots more to come, including: A living nightmare - how a teacher fought to clear his name after untrue allegations went viral. More people are cycling in London than ever before. That’s according to Transport for London, who have also revealed that the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured on the capital’s roads is at its lowest level. The Mayor has welcomed the figures, but campaigners say the number ",,
64,BBC1 London,4-jun-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten - the Chancellor decides to bring forward billions of pounds of government savings. Among the unprotected Whitehall departments, where the cuts could hit hardest, are defence, justice and higher and early years education. And the government will sell its remaining stake in Royal Mail for £1.5 billion as part of the Chancellor’s drive to balance the books. We have to bring spending down so our country lives within its means and as with any challenge the sooner you get on with it the better. But Labour says that bringing the savings forward is a sign of panic at the Treasury. Also tonight: jack Warner, former FIFA vice-president, says he’ll reveal all he knows about corruption at world football’s governing body. Germany’s chancellor tells the BBC she’s confident a way can be found to keep the UK in the EU. In Calais, officials report a big increase in the number of migrants who are trying to get into Britain. be making their way into space? Later on BBC London. The Prime Minister and the Mayor go underground as tunnelling for Crossrail is completed. Election hustings take place in Tower Hamlets ahead of next week’s vote for a new Mayor. Good evening. The government’s remaining stake in Royal Mail is to be sold and at least £2 billion will be cut from government spending this year. The two initiatives were announced by Chancellor George Osborne today, ahead of further reductions to be spelled out next month. Raison d’etre raison Mr Osborne said it would help Britain to live within its means. But Labour accused him of ‘ripping up’ his long-term economic plan by bringing forward the timetable for spending cuts. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston has more details. A government that’s just under a month-old has delivered, well, cuts, or what it likes to call savings, in defence spending of £500 million. justice, EZA9 million, the non-school part of education, Âli50 million, among other things. Austerity, in case you were in any doubt, rolls on. Getting on with what we promised, reducing the deficit. That is how you deliver lasting economic security for working people. As everyone knows when it comes to living within your means, the sooner you start, the smoother the ride. The Treasury, the smooth operator, not according to Labour’s new temporary Shadow Chancellor. It sounds to me as though any semblance of a long-term plan has been totally ripped up, that we have panic in the Treasury. George Osborne announced Eli. 5 billion is being raised this year but that’s a slightly deceptive number. At least £2 billion of that comes from one-off asset sales and some of the other savings are also one-offs, leaving perhaps £2 billion of permanent spending cuts, a down payment as it were on the £30 billion that the government promised to find by 2018. There’s money in those letters, a lot of it. In that the Treasury is selling its remaining Royal Mail shares. The £1.5 billion likely to be raised from the sale of the Royal Mail stake, may sound like a lot of money but it’s a drop in the ocean against the Government’s £1.5 trillion of national debt. Also a cheque posted to the Government only once, unlike the efficiency savings which should yield cashier after year. The Chancellor still has some really tough targets to meet. He’s looking for something like £30 billion of cuts from the unprotected Whitehall departments over the next three years, and £10 or £12 billion of cuts from social security, sos it’s small down payment on a really of cuts from social security, socialecurity it’s small down payment on a really big challenge over the next few years. Those dependant on the Chancellor’s generosity are worried, including the Scottish government. We are facing reductions in the budget and we have set a budget that supports our schools, our hospitals, the infrastructure of Scotland, the public services upon which all of our citizens depends and the UK Government on a whim has decided to reflect more austerity on the people of Scotland, austerity that the people of Scotland clearly rejected. The question for a new parliamentary backbencher is whether those cuts are consistent with the Prime Minister’s pledge to govern for the whole country. I would urge him, perhaps through the Chancellor, to follow through on this one nation rhetoric. For us on this side at every turn, we will hold this Government to account for what it is living up to its own test - one nation in spirit and deed. And Mr Speaker, if that is where the battleground of politics lies in the years ahead, I welcome it and I look forward to playing my part. The front line of a new war on waste, perhaps, but the supposedly easier phase of austerity may have been the last Parliament. Future cuts may require hard choices on which services the public sector should actually provide. Our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale is in Downing Street. d’etre Billions of saving brought forward but this is very much just the beginning? raison d’etre raison d’etre That’s right. This isjust a start. We have a Government that’s been elected on a manifesto promising to make £30 billion of spending cuts in 2016 and 2017. George Osborne has brought some savings forward for several reasons. If you spread the cuts in savings over three years, as opposed to two, it makes it easier for Whitehall to cope Labour is distracted electing the next leader and the Chancellor hopes that he can convince the voters he is cracking on with cutting the deficit. These are not massive numbers looking at the bigger picture. Clearly significant to further and higher education, to health budgets, a sea gull scheme could be cut but the bottom line is this, there is a Budget next month, the Spending Review in the autumn, that is where the pain comes, £12 billion, real money that goes to real people, that they will not receive as much, the impact will be greater. Thank you very much. jack Warner, the former vice-president of Fifa, has said he’s planning to reveal all he knows about corruption at world football’s governing body. Mr Warner is one of the 14 people charged by the US authorities over alleged corruption at Fifa. He told television viewers in Trinidad that he had records of financial transactions, which included those of Sepp Blatter, who announced his resignation as president of Fifa earlier this week. Mr Blatter has denied any wrongdoing. Our correspondent Ed Thomas reports from Trinidad. Defiant, and ready for a fight, jack Warner is at the centre of a bribery scandal. He had this emergency to the world. I will not say at age 72, I will not say quiet, to allow them to deprive me of my freedom. The former Fifa vint, told supporters he was innocent and is now ready to tell all. I have complied a comprehensive and a detailed series of documents. Decide. Decide. Documents, bills, speeches and e-mails. I have it here. jack Warner is battling for his freedom. He began with this broadcast, that he paid for on local TV, with a warning to Fifa and to Sepp Blatter. Warner was WBFHEF WGS OFICE OFIE of Warner was once one of football’s most powerful figures, a man who helped to bring David Beckham and the England team to Trinidad in 2010. His statement has been dramatic. jack Warner no longer has the influence to attract the big names to his home town. But after three decades at the heart of Fifa, he is ready to reveal its secrets. jack Warner, elected to Fifa executive in the 1980s. Leading the football confederation. Four years ago, he was suspended by Fifa and gave up his role in international football. In 2013, it was found that Warner was fraudulent in his management of of the the confederation. Now, Fifa’s once Vice-President, is facing pressure like never before. Though I fearfor like never before. Though I fear for my life, like never before. Though I fearfor my life, I say do you deny what we have done to stop the avalanche that is coming? Many in Fifa will be wondering if his threats are real. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan is at Fifa headquarters in Zurich. Where does all this leave the organisation? Well more revelations, more embarrassment here tonight. We have had the news that the FA of Ireland have confirmed that they received a multimillion pound payment from Fifa several years ago over the Republic of Ireland’s failure to make the 2010 World Cup finals. It seems that the FIA believes this was a means of dissuading them of taking legal action, overthe dissuading them of taking legal action, over the Republic of Ireland’s denial over a refereeing by a French striker, Thierry Henry. Fifa say it was a loan that they never called in. Others are claiming it was hush money, that there should be an inquiry into the payment. Amidst the atmosphere that sounds Fifa, it was the last thing it feeded. Rememberwe Fifa, it was the last thing it feeded. Remember we have had the amazing confessions from Chuck Blazer and Sepp Blatter saying he started a reform process here but in truth, many are answering whether or not Fifa can survive in the long-term at all. Thank you very much. Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, says she’s optimistic that a solution will be found to keep the UK in the European Union. She added that she wasn’t losing any losing sleep over the prospect of a British exit. Mrs Merkel told the BBC that that solution could include changes to current EU treaties. She was speaking to our Europe editor Katya Adler, whojoins us now from She was speaking to our Europe from Berlin with the latest. Well tonight here Angela Merkel is making the final preparations to host the G7 summit this weekend. Meanwhile, managing her meetating role in a number of creasis, like the Ukraine and Greece. This lunch time we managed to speak to her about a less pressing subject, that still, Angela Merkel says, is a top priority for her. That is keeping Britain inside the EU. Angela Merkel is the most powerful woman in the world and the EU’s most influential leader. It is rare to get to speak with her one to one. The german Chancellor, sounding upbeat about the chances of Britain getting a knew EU deal but I asked was it far-reaching enough to persuade the British voters to send a clear ""yes"" to the EU? We need a solution that is good for us, that we can live with and good for the people of Britain. Some of the things that David Cameron is asking for I can support. On other issues our views differ. We have managed a Europe of different speeds to agree on opt-outs. So I don’t lose sleep but this is about hard work to create the necessary preconditions for Great Britain to stay in the EU. Angela Merkel told me when the Prime Minister was Angela Merkel told me when the Prime Ministerwas in Berlin Angela Merkel told me when the Prime Minister was in Berlin last week he discussed his request for reform in detail. Other leaders wait to hear from David Cameron at an EU summit this month but they know he wants treaty change and for the British Parliament to veto EU laws. Will he get that, I asked? The EU is a union of 28 Member States that have to find a compromise. When everyone is agreed and happy can we get the proper results. That will is there. We have found solutions to many, many difficult questions. It should be like that in this case too. Does it mean that treaties will be changed? If that is really necessary, then we have to think about it. I’m optimistic if we want it, there will be a solution. And the veto for the British Parliament? We will find a solution. Angela Merkel sees herself as a friend of Britain. She likes David Cameron, she wants the UK to stay inside the European Union but make no mistake, this country has invested the last 60 years in the European project and the German Chancellor will only act on what she believes are the interests of her own country and the EU as a whole. Maybe not always matching what Britain wants. As David Cameron seeks to win over Eurosceptics at home in the months ahead, he runs the risk of alienating germane, the key European ally. But for now the relationship is on course, moving forward. A more immediate concern for Chancellor Merkel is the financial crisis in Greece where Germany is coordinating the EU’s response. Greece is now having to delay its latest debt repayment to the IMF and will pay the remaining instalments by the end ofjune. Let’sjoin Katya again in Berlin. Katya, is there still confidence that Greece can fulfil its obligations? Well, this is an unprecedented situation. Never before has a developed economy postponed the repayment of an IMF loan. Infact, it’s only ever happened once before, that was with Zambia. For months we have had economists and politicians predicting Greece is about to go bankrupt. Its decision this week not to pay back that IMF repayment shows how precarious the situation is. Remember, this is alljust about finding a short-term solution, never mind the long-term economic viability of Greece. The Greek Prime Minister is an unknown quantity. There are rumours tonight that he may call a referendum, or even snap elections on a bail-out deal. Angela Merkel told me today that Greece is a top priority for her, that negotiations are tough but she still hopes there will be a good solution and there are reports tonight she is locked in a late-night chat with the Greek Prime Minister and her French counterpart, Francois Hollande. A man and woman from Berkshire have been charged with terror offences. Sana Ahmed Khan and Mohammed Rehman were arrested last Thursday. Their home addresses in Earley and Reading were searched at the weekend. They’ve been charged with preparing for acts of terrorism in the UK and will appear before Westminster Magistrates Court tomorrow. Downing Street has made a new appeal to the body that sets MPs’ pay to abandon plans for a £7,000 pay rise. It said in a letter to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority that the planned rise was ‘not appropriate’. But IPSA says there is public support for the package, which includes smaller pensions and lower expenses for MPs. Some of the biggest names in British athletics have expressed concern at the doping allegations surrounding the athletics coach, Alberto Salazar. An investigation by the BBC has uncovered claims that Mr Salazar was involved in banned practices - claims that he strongly denies. The British Olympic champion Mo Farah is one of Mr Salazar’s athletes, but there’s no suggestion Mr Farah has broken any rules. Our sports correspondent, Natalie Pirks, has the latest. He’s one of the biggest names in athletics coaching, responsible for two of the sport’s biggest stars. He’s the Olympic 10K silver medallist Galen Rupp and he’s the best-known face in British distance running, the double Olympic Champion, Mo Farah. Salazar and Rupp are at the centre of allegations in a BBC investigation that they have been involved in banned doping practices. There is no suggestion Mo Farah has broken any anti-doping rules and both Salazar and Rupp strenuously deny the allegations. Infact, today they slammed the investigation, Salazar calling it ""inaccurate and unfounded journalism"", that opted for ""sensationalism and innuendo"". And Rupp insisted the allegations were ""not true"", with ""no evidence"" calling it ""inexcusa ble, irresponsible journalism"". But those who make it their life’s work to catch drug cheats in sport were paying close attention. We are always concerned when somebody makes allegations, but we have to remember constantly that they are only allegations. They have to be proved, they have to be investigated. And somebody has got to get at the truth. So where do the sponsors come in? This is the flagship Nike Oregon Project, a state-of-the-art athletics facility dedicated to churning out champions and headed up by Alberto Salazar. Galen Rupp is one of their poster boys and today Nike released just a short statement simply confirming they take the allegations very seriously and don’t condone the use of performance-enhancing drugs in any manner. When Galen Rupp won silver behind champion Mo Farah at the 10,000 metre Olympic final in 2012, it was the seen of Salazar’s biggest coaching triumph. His link to British sport is well established. He’s been a consultant for UK Athletics for the last two years. Now, some in the sport think Mo Farah might want to reconsider the company he’s keeping. If I found that I had a coach or a training partner that was facing these allegations, I would run a mile, I would not want to be associated with people with such serious allegations. What of Mo, then? He said he’s seen no evidence of doping at the Oregon Project, but on Saturday, at a press conference in Birmingham, it will be hard for him to sidestep questions about his close links to Salazar and the methods his coach might have employed to guide athletes to glory. Natalie Pirks, BBC News. Officials in Calais say they’re struggling to cope with a huge influx of migrants trying to get to Britain. The numbers in the town have risen from 200 at the beginning of last year to 3,000 this month. Many are so desperate to cross the Channel that they’re now trying to climb aboard lorries in broad daylight. From Calais, our correspondent Lucy Williamson sent this report. They used to wait for nightfall. Now, Calais’ stowaways choose their hiding places in broad daylight, under the noses of the border police. But the sunshine also makes them easier to spot. Police have made 19,000 of these discoveries so far this year. Last year, it was 8,000. Calais’ battle with its migrants is becoming a routine d8I’ICâ, EVEFI B QBITIE to SOITIE. And a new fence donated by Britain is doing little to help. Every day the migrants and the border guards converge here to wage their battle of attrition. They have installed a double razor-wire fence on this side to stop the migrants coming in, but the new camp is on this side and there is nothing to stop them. The UK is due to fund a second fence to wall off the new camp from the port area, but the number of migrants in Calais has surged, from 200 at the start of last year, to around 3,000 today. This man arrived from Sudan two months ago. He has already tried 25 times to cross the Channel. 25, yes. 2-5. ""I don’t worry about the police,"" he says. ""What can they do?"" What would make you stop? ""Nothing,"" he says, ""not even the prospect of death. As long as I am alive I’ll keep trying."" Alongside the ferry terminal, trucks stand with their doors wide open. This driver tells us he has found migrants inside eight times. TRANSLATION: We keep the doors open to show the migrants there is nowhere to hide and nothing to steal. It is a huge problem, they are never far away from the truck. Fences, border checks, open trucks. How do you police people who have lost their fear, but not yet their hope? Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Calais. In China, work has started to raise the upturned ship on which more than 400 people are thought to have died. The Eastern Star sank in the Yangtze River on Tuesday after being caught in a freak storm. just 14 of the mostly elderly passengers are known to have survived. Our correspondent, john Sudworth, is in the town ofjianli where he’s been allowed to see the recovery work. In disciplined, orderly silence, they wait. It’s a tense break from a grim, almost unimaginable assignment. A short distance away, engineers are welding hooks on to the upturned hull. With the lifting of the ship, the recovery of the trapped bodies will only quicken. The body collectors are there to meet each one. The BBC was invited to film this dreadful, but dignified work of bringing more than 400 dead ashore. TRANSLATION: We soldiers want to save lives. But the conditions have made it very difficult, so we feel deep anxiety. But among the bereaved, frustration is mounting, with one group breaking through a police cordon late at night. This man and his daughter asked us to help them and we agreed, taking them through a checkpoint where other relatives have been turned back. In the distance, the wreck site is visible. A beloved wife and mother, she had been on board. TRANSLATION: Until now, we had no idea what’s going on, no information at all. But the operation is now entering a new phase. The flow of supplies to the recovery teams appears to be increasing. So, as the retrieval of the bodies gathers pace, the relatives can finally begin to help identify them and they, as well as the wider public, can begin to mourn what is one of China’s worst shipping disasters in living memory. But real questions remain about the safety of this ship before it sank and the claim that it was bad weather alone that was responsible, as well as the information being given to and the treatment of the relatives of those on board. Questions for another time, perhaps. These men still have much work to do. john Sudworth, BBC News, injianli, on the Yangtze River. The first trips to space for paying passengers were meant to have started seven years ago, but the Virgin Galactic launch was delayed - and then last year it suffered a major setback when its spaceship crashed during a test flight in California. Now one of the pilots involved in the crash has spoken about the accident for the first time. Our transport correspondent, Richard Westcott, is in California where a new craft is being built. Richard. This is Virgin Galactic ‘s headquarters. We are in the middle of the desert. That large white aircraft there, that is the mother ship, that carries the spaceship up to 50,000 feet, drops it and the rocket fires. Over there in the corner, that is Virgin’s new spaceship.

Now her mother works as a maid to feed the family, and Samira trains to make herself stronger. TRANSLATION: No one helped us when we needed it. It makes me so angry. Is it because we are Hazara? Why wouldn’t anyone help us? I learn karate because I want to show the world that girls are not weak. Experts say young people in the Hazara community are under severe psychological strain. At least 1,000 young people have been killed by unknown assailants in the past few years. Religion is a factor, as they are a minority Shia community in a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation.

The Hazara Shias, limited to ghetto-like areas on the very edges of Quetta. As you can see, in front of them, the mountain ranges. Behind them, a city in which they cannot move around freely. The sense of entrapment is growing stronger. But their children have found many ways to break free, to find their identity and to be heard. The Hazara parkour boys do not want the world to see them as victims. Their performances have gone viral on social media and they have followers from around the world, but no one knows them at home. Despite being the only group in Pakistan to practise parkour, they have no support. TRANSLATION: Even if we are limited to these two areas like in a prison camp, we want to show that we can still make our country proud of us. These boys say they no longer feel trapped, because they have found a way to be who they are, to free themselves from the reality of the Pakistan they live in. They say their hard work and dreams will one day help them soar above their circumstances. He’s one of the world’s most distinguished conductors and pianists, but could Daniel Barenboim now add inventor to his list of accolades? He has unveiled a new type of grand piano which he says is radically different to the standard concert version. It is built with straight parallel strings, which he says produce a superior sound. Will Gompertz has been to London’s Royal Festival Hall to meet the maestro. Daniel Barenboim, playing Beethoven’s Sonata Appassionata opus 57 on his Steinway grand piano. It makes a wonderful sound, but not one, in his opinion, that is quite as clear as this, the sound made by the new piano he has recently conceived. The variation between the two might appear marginal to the untrained ear, but for the maestro, they are quite different in sound and feel. The contact with the key is with the tip of the finger, and the relationship between the tip of the finger and the key is different. It’s not a difference in weight. It’s because it speaks immediately. And each note is more independent. It has more diversity. Why did you want to make a new piano? I played on one of Liszt’s pianos in Siena in Italy, which had been completely reconstructed for the bicentenary of his birth in 2011, and I was struck by the transparency and the independence of the notes in this piano. The most obvious difference is in the layout of the strings. A typical modern grand piano has a two-tier design, with the strings crossing diagonally, whereas Barenboim’s are arranged like the Liszt piano, flat and straight. When Liszt taught, he said to one of his students, if you play a chord of four notes, each one must have a different sound. And that, you can do on this piano. But you can’t do on a regular Steinway? I don’t like to think about the things I can’t do. If Beethoven or Mozart were sitting here today, which piano would they play, the new Barenboim or the old Steinway? just bring them here so I have a chance to talk to them! There are currently only two Barenboim pianos in the world, one of which was presented to the media in London at the Royal Festival Hall, where it will remain for him to play at a series of concerts of Schubert’s piano sonatas. And that is all from Reporters for this week. From me, Philippa Thomas, goodbye for now. Conditions were slow to improve on Sunday across southern and eastern parts of the country.

And I’m Lebo Diseko in London. The headlines: Still no deal, US senators continue to debate the possible extension of controversial anti-terror laws. Trapped between Islamic State and government troops, the fate of thousands of Iraqi families hang in the balance. As the fighting continues, the former American commander in Iraq tells the BBC local troops can overcome IS. And, a new smoking ban comes into force in Beijing today. Will it be any more successful than previous efforts? It’s1AM here in London. And it’s 8AM here in Singapore on Monday the first ofjune. Broadcasting to viewers around the world, this is Newsday. The United States Senate is holding an urgent session to consider extending controversial surveillance laws just hours before they are due to expire. Key provisions of the Patriot Act will end at midnight in Washington, that’s about four hours from now. The laws allow the National Security Agency to carry out the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records and include other measures to track terrorist suspects. President Obama has described a move to block new surveillance laws to replace them as ""reckless"". From Washington, here’s Tom Bateman. Essentially, what we have here in the US is the kind of gridlock that Americans have become used to from politicians in the past. In the past it has been to do with budget measures. This is the first time that national security has reached what they call here the cliff. A point in the debate were the measures themselves will expire. They will expire at a minute past midnight here in Washington. Those who want them to remain in place, who include President Obama, say, if these measures disappear we will have a gap in our ability to protect the United States. On the other side, a coalition from both sides of the political divide who believe that these measures are overly intrusive. They include Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who himself wants to be president, who has said he is determined to try to use procedural tactics to try to delay this boat to get these powers extended. -- vote. If this happens it may only be a couple of days until another measure can be put in place. The supporters of those powers say they will continue to protect the United States. Thousands of families in Iraq are trapped by fighting between Islamic State extremists and government forces. Human rights groups have accused Iraq’s government of failing to help many of those trying to flee to safer parts of the country. Many are attempting to escape from Anbar province, where Islamic State fighters recently seized the key city of Ramadi. From Anbar, Orla Guerin reports. Advancing on Islamic State in Anbar Province. Fighters from a Shia militia on the frontline in recent days. They may be a bigger threat to Islamic State than the Iraqi army. For those trying to flee the insurgents, this bridge over the Euphrates is a key escape route from Anbar Province, or it should be. Now there is more commercial traffic getting in than desperate civilians getting out. But this man and his family have just managed to leave Fallujah after pleading with Islamic State for two months. I begged them, he told me, I gave them medical reports to prove I need surgery. On the way out we had to hide from airstrikes and walk for nine hours in the desert. A tent city across the river is as far as many of Anbar’s Sunni Muslims can get because the Shia led government is limiting access to Baghdad. This is where many of those who fled from Islamic State are standard, some have already been here for two months and the conditions are grim. -- stranded. They are at the mercy of punishing heat. Families here say they are getting little or no help and feel abandoned by their government. Many, like this man, are running on empty. He is worried for his heavily pregnant wife, and four children. So worried, he is thinking of fleeing again, back to Islamic State. TRANSLATION: If this situation continues with high temperatures and no services all of us will go back. Most went already because we had nothing here. For now, more than 200 families remain here. Victims of Islamic State and Iraqi your -- bureaucracy. The architect of the US surge in Iraq has told the BBC that the group calling itself Islamic State is a formidable enemy but can be beaten. David Petraeus, a retired US four-star general and former CIA director, cautioned that a political, as well as military solution, was needed to defeat the militant Speaking exclusively to our diplomatic correspondent, jonathan Marcus, the former commander of American forces in Iraq said the loss of the town of Ramadi two weeks ago was a major set back, but he expected it to be retaken shortly. ~ I think when you sustain a reverse of significant setbacks like the loss of Ramadi, notjust an operational loss, the loss of the Anbar operational command headquarters as well. But a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative, the reality of Islamic State being on the defensive, of losing, was shown to be somewhat hollow as well. I think Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks, if not shorter, but this was a big setback. What does the US in particular need to do to get the strategy back on track? We have to recognise that while we must indeed regain the momentum against Islamic State on the battlefield, on the front lines of this fight, there also has to be a major effort in Baghdad where the real centre of gravity lies in this fight. You cannot deal with an industrial strength extremist insurgents problem just with the force of arms, you need the political component as well. As important as arms are, and indeed recognising that they must be killed or captured, defeated, but to enable that, it will require political initiatives on the part of those key Iraqi leaders, starting of course with Prime Minister are bloody who knows what needs to be done to give the Sunni Arab community a reason to support the new lock, ratherthan community a reason to support the new lock, rather than oppose it. -- they questioned the will of the Iraqis to fight. Do you think the Iraqi military can perform? I think it can with good leadership and the support of Baghdad and the empowerment that comes from all of that. During the search and in the years after that, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country in vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know they can fight and we know they will fight but they will only fight if they have good leadership and indeed they have the support and knowledge that somebody has their back when they get into a tough fight. David Petraeus, speaking to jonathan Marcus in Singapore. Someone else who’s been in Singapore is the US defence Secretary Ashton Carter. While there, he spoke exclusively to my colleague Katty Kay. Here she is to tell us about it. With unusually outspoken language, the US Defence Secretary has been ruffling feathers in Iraq and in China. I will be sitting down for an exclusive interview with Ashton Carter in Vietnam as he travels through Asia, join me on Monday for full coverage hereon BBC News. -- here on. Two British banks, Barclays and Standard Chartered, have begun reviews into whether they were used to channel corrupt payments by world football’s governing body, Fifa. The banks were named by the FBI last week, when it arrested a number of top FIFA officials. In Switzerland the daughter of the FIFA President, Sepp Blatter, has defended her father, saying he is the victim of a conspiracy. Corinne Blatter has been speaking to the BBC’s Richard Conway. For now, Sepp Blatter fights on. Despite the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history, he confounded his critics by winning the presidential election and insists only he can restore trust in football world governing body. He is happy that everything is gone and finished. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Corran Blatter, the only daughter of Sepp Blatter, and a close confidant, believes that last week’s events are the work of those watching ultimately to oust her father. Does he think this is a conspiracy between UK and US? I would not say them, but certainly people working behind the scenes, absolutely. Dark forces? I don’t know if you want to call them that. They really tried hard. Everything already started last year, in September, October, everything started there. They tried a lot. Following last week’s dawn raids, US prosecutors say one of the many allegations was Aiken million-dollar bribe wide from a Fifa account to help secure the 2010 South African World Cup. -- Aiken million-dollar. Sepp Blatter has denied involvement in that and his daughter insists he is not corrupt. No one is without fault. But the things he has done so far... He is not a person... things he has done so far... He is nota person... I not a person... I want to say this... He is not a person who is taking money. All the money he earns he did so by working. And he is a hard-working president. His character hard-working president. His character is not like that, he is not taking any money. Is he concerned about being arrested? No. We talked about that this morning and he is an. If law enforcement agencies do want him to co-operate, do want to question him, will he say yes to that? -- isn’t. You will have to ask an. 73 football associations voted against him, but with his presidency and short for another four years, presidency and short for another fouryears, his four years, his family believe that his legacy depends on healing a divided sport. The move to legalise same-sex marriage is in the spotlight in Australia, with the opposition Labour Party preparing to introduce its own bill later on Monday. There now seems to be an undeniable shift towards marriage equality, with conservative Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, suggesting government MPs will soon be allowed a conscience vote. From Sydney, Phil Mercer has more. This is a private members bill from the labour opposition leader, you’ll shorten. He says there is undeniable to momentum for change. This bill will redefine the definition of marriage in Australia. -- Bill Shorten. From being between a man and a woman to being between two individuals. It is unlikely to have support in the Parliament because of a demand from the Conservative Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, that government MPs not support the legislation. But what we are seeing in Australia is a mood, a shifting of the public mood, and that is seeping in the political mood as well. This bill may not pass. Campaign is certainly believe that in the next few months we could see some momentous changes here in Australia because the Prime Minister, MrAbbott, has indicated, as you say, that government MPs could soon be allowed a free vote on this very sensitive and important issue. Three football players from the British Premier League club, Leicester City, have apologised after a video emerged showing them racially abusing a Thai woman. The players, Tom Hopper, james Pearson and Adam Smith, were visiting Thailand as part of a goodwill tour organised by Leicester’s Thai owner, Vichai Raksriaksorn. The players are returning home early from the trip, and Leicester City has released a statement saying the club is deeply concerned about the incident and remains wholly committed to promoting equality in football and in wider society. You’re watching Newsday on the BBC, live from Singapore and London. Still to come on the programme. Starting today, Beijing is having another attempt to ban smoking in public places indoors, could it actually work this time? And, six days, six nights but only one pilot, we’ll find out how the man flying the Solar Impulse plane does it. Let’s take a look now at what some of Monday’s papers are reporting. We start with the Wall Street journal, which has a picture showing the destruction in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu following last month’s earthquake, and reports on some kind of normality returning. The paper also reports from the Shangri-La dialogue being held in Singapore, and quotes a senior Chinese naval commander as saying that the controversial islands that his country is building in the South China Sea will benefit all. And if you want to see what these islands look like, there’s a front page picture in Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Like a number of other papers, Gulf News reports on the US Secretary of State john Kerry’s bicycle accident, he’ll have to cut his trip to Europe short and will return to America for treatmentl. And finally, China Daily reports on the strict smoking ban that kicks in today, requiring all indoor public places and many outdoor places in Beijing to be smoke-free. This is Newsday on the BBC. I’m Rico Hizon in Singapore. And I’m Lebo Diseko in London. The headlines: The US National Security Agency has started switching off systems monitoring American telephone calls as Senators debate whether to extend laws granting surveillance powers. Human rights activists have accused the Iraqi government of hindering civilians trying to escape Islamic State militants in the eastern province of Anbar. China has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world with more than 300 million smokers. But from today smokers in Beijing are banned from lighting up in public places. Those breaking the law will face fines of up to $30. But as our China correspondent, Martin Patience, now reports this isn’t the first time the capital has tried to kick its habit. China. A smoker ‘s paradise, a country that consumes a third of the world ‘s cigarettes. More than half the men smoke here but at what cost? A million people die a year from smoking related illnesses. Now Beijing says it wants to quit for good. The capital is banning smoking in public places including at restaurants like this one. The thing is, there have been smoking bans before but they haven’t worked and what is surprising about China is the way that people just break the rules. If they want a cigarette, theyjust pulled one out, light one UP theyjust pulled one out, light one up and smoke away but authorities say that this time around things are going to be different and if you do smoke in a public place, will face a heavy fine. TRANSLATION: I think the ban would be hard to enforce in China. There are simply too many smokers. If you really want to go smoking, you should shut down the cigarette factories. If they ban smoking ban I’m not coming to Beijing. Smoking in public places harms everyone. I think the ban can work but everyone needs to be on board. Smoking was once common amongst China ‘s leaders. Chairman Mao and his successor were rarely seen without a cigarette in hand. But the current president has bucked the trend. He has quit and that is because the government finally realises the cost of smoking say antitobacco campaigners. TRANSLATION: Tobacco taxes are a huge source of revenue for the government. The costs of treating smoking-related illnesses are now higher. The president talks about the Chinese dream but he says it first of all, you must be healthy. If you smoke and fall sick, there will be no Chinese dream. But talking about quitting and actually doing it are two different things. And China is bound to suffer nicotine withdrawals during the process. joining me from Beijing is Dr Angela Pratt, the World Health Organisation’s Technical officer for Tobacco Control. Thank you forjoining us. In your view, will this new smoking ban actually make a difference and will it work? We think it will work and here are the reasons why. First of all, this is a very strong law and very tough, the toughest tobacco law we have seen in China and one of the toughest in this part of the world. Unlike previous attempts to ban smoking which were referenced in your lead in story, this law has very strong analgesia including for the owners and managers of the premises that don’t comply -- very strong penalties. The owner will be liable for a very hefty fine if patrons are found smoking which was not the case before which is why we think it will be different this time around I’ll stop a strong and tough law with penalties that create the right incentives for owners to comply. Eight strong and tough law so the political will is there -- 6. so the political will is there -- a, for the mainland government to implement this smoking ban? Yes and this is one of the big changes we have seen in China over the last few years. There is a very strong commitment at the highest levels of government to take stronger action on tobacco and that is because, I think, China ‘s: -- China ‘s political leaders understand what a huge problem it is for China. There are 300 million smokers here which makes China the biggest consumer and producer of tobacco in the world. It takes a huge toll on the health industry. China is a big consumer of cigarettes but the big problem also in the mainland is that cigarette packs are very cheap. They are about 80 US cents per pack. Shouldn’t the government raised the terrorists or even the taxes, -- tarriffs, to stop people from smoking? You’re right, it is a big challenge how cheap it is here and it has become more affordable overtime as the income of the average person has increased. -- over time. A few weeks ago the government announced a tax increase and announced that the increase will be passed onto the retail price of cigarettes. It was a modest increase but we do that it will have a modest, although measurable impact on tobacco consumption in China but thatis on tobacco consumption in China but that is definitely an area where there will be more action in the future because cigarettes are very affordable and more people, especially young people are likely to purchase them and smoke them which is a big problem. Thank you for your insight. Thousands of schools which were damaged during April’s devastating earthquake in Nepal have begun to re-open. More than 25,000 classrooms in the capital, Kathmandu, and a dozen surrounding districts, were destroyed in the 7.8 magnitude quake and its continuing aftershocks. The BBC’s Surendra Phuyal is in Kathmandu. After nearly five weeks of living in trauma and fear, thousands of Nepalese students have started returning to school. Around the country many schools were devastated by the recent earthquakes. Children and there are still concerned about the safety in the face of continuing aftershocks that teachers today try to make the students feel comfortable in the school complexes like this one, encouraging children to take part in games and other group activities. Teachers hope things can be normal again for children as the days pass by. The government estimates say thousands of schools were destroyed by the big quakes in recent weeks. In the worst affected districts hundreds of schools have collapsed and they are having to make temporary classrooms out of bamboo. Here in Kathmandu not all the schools have collapsed and thatis all the schools have collapsed and that is why students could come to school. As they came to school after it reopened, they seemed happy and playful. Some news in brief now: The US Secretary of State, john Kerry, is being treated overnight in a hospital in Geneva after breaking his leg cycling in the French Alps. He’s planning to leave Switzerland shortly and return to the United States for further treatment. The State Department says Mr Kerry had broken a part of his right leg, but did not lose consciousness. South Korea’s health minister says mistakes were made in his country’s handling of an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Virus, known as Mers. Moon Hyung-Pyo said doctors failed to identify and isolate the patient who brought the disease to South Korea after a trip to Saudi Arabia. 15 people have now been diagnosed with the virus in the country. Thailand’s 87-year-old king returned to a hospital in Bangkok on Sunday after spending three weeks at a coastal resort south of the capital. He’d previously spent seven months at a clinic, following surgery on his gall- bladder. An official statement said the world’s longest reigning monarch is undergoing a regular check up. Pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong have met Chinese officials in a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences over electoral reform in the territory. Beijing plans to introduce direct elections, but only with a restricted list of candidates. Legislators left the meeting promising to continue to fight the proposals, which led to led to the ‘umbrella’ street protests last year. Now, flying a plane all by yourself for six days and six nights is enough of a challenge. How much more if the only source of power is the sun and if the journey’s never been done before? That’s exactly what the pilot of Solar Impulse is doing. It took off about 24 hours ago from Nanjing in China, en route to Hawaii in the United States. It’s the latest leg in the team’s mission to fly a solar-powered plane around the world. The non-stop flight to Hawaii is the most challenging yet. If successful, it will be the longest solo flight in history. Well, according to the Solar Impulse flight tracker, this is where the plane is right now, one day into itsjourney. It’s flying over the Sea ofjapan between the Korean Peninsula and the japanese island of Honshu. A little earlier, the pilot Andre Borschberg spoke to us direct from the cockpit. We are We a re really We are really at the limits of the technology. The jet is We are really at the limits of the technology. Thejet is bigger than We are really at the limits of the technology. The jet is bigger than a 71+7 and as light as a car, so which is designed to save energy and designed to fly at night. But we are at the limits and we need good weather, especially in the morning, especially now. That is the role of the mission centred which is fixing our flight strategy and ensuring that in the morning I have a sunny spot where I can charge my battery. You’ve been watching Newsday from the BBC. Thank you for watching. Over the next few days we have wet and windy weather in the forecast but before we reached that point, I will recap the weather on Sunday when a band of rain and wind swept across the country eventually clearing eastwards to leave a mixture of showers with spells of sunshine. Overnight we continue to see showers across northern and western areas, some of them win three of the Scottish mountains and it will be breezy with central and southern and eastern areas seeing fewer showers. Some chilli areas in the country but less cold across southwestern areas. We start the first ofjune on a bright note and quite chilly across the eastern areas. Showers around southwest England and in towards Wales in the Midlands and some of them could be heavy. The winds are beginning to pick up at this point in the morning. Showers across northern England as well and certainly showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland but with some sunshine in between. By this point in the morning we could start to see more persistent rain pushing him towards Northern Ireland. -- in. This weather system will push him from the west and conditions will turn wetter and windy or-- in -- windier. It will definitely turn downhill as the afternoon wears on. 15-16 after that bright start in the Southeast and only up to 13 elsewhere. Forthe Southeast and only up to 13 elsewhere. For the cricket at Headingly it looks like it will be a dry start with the cloud gathering and outbreaks of rain pushing in from the west as the rain pushes in. This area will see low pressure systems suite in on Monday night and into Tuesday with winds of up to 70 mph in some places. On Tuesday it will still be with us blowing very strong winds with bands of rain being very slow to clear southern and eastern areas. Heavy rain across Scotland and other areas quite cool. Another pretty wild day on Tuesday but by Wednesday this area of high pressure starts to move in from the south to settle things down. Wednesday is the better looking day with a breeze across northern and western areas which will die down as the day goes on. Elsewhere it will turn dry with warm spells of sunshine and temperatures 13 -19 or 20 across the Southeast. The new working week. Wet and windy and will start to turn drier and slowly by the end of the week, it will get warmer as well. ~ The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Lebo Diseko.

There’s an impasse among senators over whether to allow the NSA to continue collecting such information. President Obama has urged them to pass a new law. Human rights activists are accusing the Iraqi authorities of preventing thousands of people reaching safer parts of the country after fleeing fighting in Anbar province. The activists say the government, which is dominated by Shia Muslims, is discriminating against Sunni Muslims displaced by Islamic State militants.

Malaysia airlines will announce plans to downsize today. India’s best loved brand of instant noodles is in hot water over unacceptable levels of lead and MSG. Thank you forjoining us. Troubled national carrier Malaysia airlines is set to unveil the details of its massive overhaul later today as it attempts to become a brand-new company with a brand-new look. It comes after years of success will losses. Thousands ofjob cuts will be confirmed, together with a downsizing of the fleet, navigating these turbulent times is a new Chief Executive who took the helm in May. Now we go to our correspondent in Kuala Lumpur. A monumental task for the new CEO. What are the plans to turn around the carrier? He basically has to convince investors that he is the man up to the task. You have already mentioned some of the changes that are set to take place. He will be cutting a third of the workforce, thousands of jobs. That will prove to be tough for very strong unions resisting this. He will also cut unpopular routes, refocusing on Asia, which many airlines in the region are doing the exact same thing. It is a growth area. Be plans will not be new, they were announced previously by the sovereign wealth fund which owns Malaysia airlines and is trying to restructure it. His task is to prove he is the man up to the task to do this because this airline has gone through many restructuring plans which were deemed failures, even before the twin tragedies. Many analysts are saying that Malaysia airlines has a long history of mismanagement and government interference, which Mr Mueller will have a difficult time overcoming. That is exactly what many analysts have been worried about, that Malaysia airlines has been run like a savvy gum and I am. -- said semigovernment I’m. That is why they said they are serious aboutjob cuts despite resistance. The CEO said himself that as fortunate as they are, they will make proper arrangements for the people who lose theirjobs. They are offering more training and a better severance package for people who will lose their jobs. package for people who will lose theirjobs. At the same time, there are many other changes that are needed. They say that the restructuring plans have not been successful, they reported in March they have cut down their operating costs by 29% per month. That will be good news for many people. We have to remind people that despite all of these financial troubles, Malaysians have these financial troubles, Malaysians have always been drought of Malaysia airlines. It had a good safety record prior to the twin tragedies, of course. -- have been proud. It was the choice for many Malaysians, comparing costs, it was the same for a low-cost carrier compared to Malaysia airlines. People would fly it. It has good branding and standing with passengers. Unfortunately because of the financial troubles and the two airline tragedies it has now come to a critical condition that is forcing it to make changes, which the government acknowledges has to happen or else the airline will not survive. It will be announced today, thank you for the update. joining us live from Kuala Lumpur or. A new set of investment rules are coming and played to China to attract $300 billion of private money for the massive infrastructure projects. Normally they are the preserve of state-run companies but an economic slowdown has meant that local governments have been struggling with huge debts and they are in need of help. I spoke with Vincent Connor, a lawyer specialising in construction. And his partner. It is being driven by the national development and reform commission. It is responsible for the five-year plans in China, for driving the wind belts, one road policy connecting China with the rest of the world, and it is responsible for the leadership of the Chinese infrastructure investment being pushed across the world. Does it need that much money? If it does, why promise $15 billion of infrastructure investments to a country like Brazil? And it also continues to invest in so many countries around the world. I think thatis countries around the world. I think that is why it has to be seen as part of a concerted and connected plan. The trade links formed through the railway, 3000 miles, 10 billion US dollars to link Rio and Brazil and China in a way that has never been possible before. To see it in that context, investment does seem sensible. Do you think, Mr Connor, the Chinese will be able to raise this large amount of money? 300 billion US dollars? Well, we have 1000 very large projects, 7-8- 9-10 billion, including the Metro being offered to those who are willing to take part in these projects. This has never happened before. The amount of interest is likely to be very significant. That will be attracted by private equity, by bond issue and by other strategic investment in China. For those getting into that market, of course, they have to look at what these rules will push for. What are the concession period is going to be involved in these be OT projects? And how do you protect us up and make sure that the rules are being set up in China to protect the long-term interest of investors. -- BOT. The big question is whether this investment will help boost the Chinese economy which is at its lowest pace in a quarter of a century. That is the strategic part of this. 7% growth now, still pretty enviable compared to other parts of the world, but clearly, they have been careful about how to look to the future and build that up. There is a huge local government debt issue driven by investing in stimulus packages over the last few years. That has to be addressed. Will it work? We will see. India’s best loved brand of instant noodles but now it is in hot water, Maggi. They are testing samples of the product and are looking for lead and a chemical called MSG. What could this mean for the iconic name? We report from Mumbai. The spicy instant noodles that made a place for themselves in India’s big the Maggi brand is so popular that the business runs entirely here because of it. At this stall, he sells variations of the snack and there are many more like him. TRANSLATION: People love Maggi because it is good and can be made quickly. It is particularly popular with children and university students. When they have to study long hours mac and get hungry, this is an easy to make dish. Now the brand is facing the heat. Authorities in this state claim to have found higher than a loud levels of lead and the taste enhancing chemical MSG. Maggi samples are being tested in other states as well. Like West own goal. Nestle did not respond to questions from the BBC, but in a statement on the website they said this. -- Bengal. We regularly monitor for lead... It is not the first time a popular food brand has had to deal with controversy here. In 2003, Cadbury faced allegations of insects being found in their chocolate bars while a year later, some farmers claimed that Pepsi and Coca-Cola were keeping pests away from their fields. Will they win back confidence? They have to reviewed the stories and advertise aggressively. Maggi holds more than 80% of the instant noodle market in India, but competition has been growing in recent years. This could be the time for other brands to take a bite out of Maggi’s share. The beating they are taking right now will seriously affect the long-term image. The process of investigation should be done quickly. The longer it takes the harder it will be for the brand to make a comeback. A few retailers have claimed that sales of Maggi have a gun to fall, so while many Indians are still happy to buy them, Nestle will have to come up with an instant fix to say the reputation of one of India’s favourite snacks. -- says. Thank you so much for investing your time with us, bye for now. The top stories this hour. The sanity and Washington has failed to pass legislation that will allow the national agency to keep collecting public records. Human rights activists say that Iraq’s government is preventing civilians from trying to escape Islamic State militants in Anbar. The Chief Executive of NHS England Simon Stevens, says that they need to clamp down on some nursing agencies who he has accused of ripping off the NHS. He was responding to reports that hospitals are paying agencies thousands of pounds for nurses to cover shifts. They play an essential role on the front line of the NHS. But hospitals are increasingly relying on temporary or agency nurses to fill shifts. And it is costing the cash-strapped service millions of pounds. You are getting nurses... Today, the head of NHS England says the problem must be tackled. One of the things we have to do is ensure that NHS hospitals are offering flexible employment for these nurses who are currently working in these temporary agencies, but also we will have to clamp down on some of these staffing agencies who, frankly, are ripping off the NHS. After failings in care were revealed in Mid-Staffordshire, hospitals increased the number of nurses on wards. But it takes three years to train a nurse, so temporary staff are plugging the gap. Agencies say the NHS failed to plan its workforce, and far from taking advantage, they provide a vital service. The demand on the NHS is not consistent, it does go through peaks and troughs, and having an agency to provide services at the last minute allows the NHS, in a way, to save money, because they don’t need to have full resourcing on their wards all the time. But growing dependence on temporary staff is costing a lot. Last year the NHS spent £1.8 billion on agency staff in England, more than double what was planned. The government says it has recruited more permanent staff, including more than 8,000 extra nurses since 2010. But unions say more must be done. First of all, more flexible working for the nurses who have got childcare responsibilities and cannot work rigid shift systems. Secondly, increase the number of student nurses in training and you will go a long way to addressing these problems. Attempts are ongoing to recruit and train more nurses, which should solve this problem in the long-term. In the short-term, it is piling pressure on a service already facing increased demand and stretched budgets. The Department of Health says the NHS does need to spend less on agency staff, and use funds more effectively. You can get more stories on line. You can also keep in touch with us on Twitter. Time for sport today. ~ Hello, this is Sport Today, live from the BBC Sport Centre. Coming up on this programme: Alberto Contador wins his second Giro D’Italia to stay on course for a Giro and Tour de France double. A mass on-pitch brawl mars the championship decider in Scotland. And Soren Kjeldsen wins the Irish Open after a three way play off at Royal County Down. Thanks forjoining us. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has hailed Alberto Contador as ""one of the greatest cyclists of all time"" after the Spaniard won the Giro d’Italia on Sunday, the seventh Grand Tour victory of his career. The Tinko-Saxoff rider retained the leaders pinkjersey for the last stage over 178km from Turin to Milan, to keep himself on course to become the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 to win both the Giro and the Tour de France in the same year. Italy’s Fabio Aru finished second and his Astana team-mate Mikel Landa of Spain was third overall. It’s been a rain delayed Day Eight at Rolland Garros, for the French Open in Paris. 2009 champion Roger Federer got broken by local favourite Gael Monfils, to even their fourth-round match at a set apiece, right before play was suspended until Monday. Earlier Elina Svitolina progressed to the last eight, while Flavia Pennetta and Garbine Muguruza’s match was also postponed until Monday. Elsewhere another Frenchman, jo-Wilifried Tsonga came through a tough four set match against Thomas Berdych to book a quarter-final encounter with Kei Nishikori. It isa It is a very good player, he is younger than me. It is a very good player, he is youngerthan me. He younger than me. He has got a lots of talent and he is able to do many things on the court. And I had problems playing against them in the past so for me, it is going to be an opportunity to take revenge and to try to play my best tennis and to try to reach the semifinals. ~ I think to come into the quarterfinals is the first goal for this week, these two weeks. I knew I could do this because I have been doing well on this season that started last year. I hope it isjust the start of myjourney and I hope I can keep going. This is the first time for me to be at the quarterfinals in the French Open so it means a lot for me. Nishikori booked his place in he last eight with a straight sets win over Teymuraz Gabashvili, Stanilas Warwinka beat Gilles Simon, while defending women’s champion Maria Sharapova’s match against Lucie Safarova again was postponed until Monday due to weather. In the opening match of the day former Champion Ana Ivanovic was a three set winner over Ekaterina Makarova. To be honest, coming into the tournament I didn’t really expect to do this well but I really worked hard for this match and I worked hard even before the tournament to reach the quarterfinals. It feels amazing. I am very proud of the way I played. Rafael Benitez’s last game in charge of Napoli saw them beaten 1+-2 by Lazio in Italy’s Serie A, to see their opponents secure the last spot for next season’s Champions League play-offs. Antonio Candreva’s goal put Lazio 2-0 up at half time. Gonzalo Higuain then scored twice to level, but missed the chance to give Napoli the lead when he missed a penalty in the 76th minute. Lazio’s victory was secured with a late goals from Onazi and Miroslav Klose. Elsewhere, Francesco Totti closed to within a single goal of the 300 mark in Roma’s 2-1 defeat to Palermo. 1+7 goals were scored across the Serie A fixtures this weekend, the most in a decade in Italy. And with 1021+ scored in all since August, Italy’s top flight finished with the most goals in a season of all the top 5 European leagues. Police in Scotland are to investigate the scenes which marred the end of Motherwell’s Premiership play-off win against Rangers at Fir Park, a match which the home side won 3-0 to preserve their top-flight status and condemn Rangers to another season in the Championship. Rangers defender Bilel Mohsni was pushed in the back by Lee Erwin apparently for refusing a handshake. The Tunisian responded by kicking and punching the Motherwell striker, which sparked a scuffle on the pitch, also involving Fraser Kerr for the home side. All three players were sent-off. Sporting Lisbon have won the Portuguese Cup, but they did it in dramatic circumstances against Braga on Sunday. They were 2-0 down with only six minutes to go in the final at the Estadio Nacional, before Islam Slimani pulled a goal back and this equaliser from Freddy Montero in the second minute of stoppage time took the match to penalties. Andre Pinto, Eder and Salvador Agra all missed successive spotkicks in the shootout to see Sporting lift their 16th cup trophy, and first since 2008, to equal Porto’s number of cups. Only Benfica, with 25, have more. Even with his third English Premier League title in the bag and the season over, Chelsea managerjose Mourinho is still eyeing up more success. His side are currently in Australia on a post-season tour and the Portuguese says he’s already planning more titles. Enjoying football is enjoying winning. That’s what I want to do for the rest of my career and this season was a great example of that. It was the sixth Premier League for me in the fourth forjohn but the first for many of our young players -- and the, and to help them achieve that success and to see how much they enjoy it and to see the product on the faces of the fans as we go back to victory again is the reason why I am in the game. Spain’sjorge Lorenzo has secured his third straight MotoGP win to put himself to within six points of his Yamaha team-mate Valentino Rossi in the standings. The two-time champion surged into the lead on the opening lap, overtaking Ducati’s Andrea Iannone from pole to stretch out a five second advantage over the chasing pack. Rossi meanwhile finished third from eighth on the grid to keep the Italian crowd happy and keep himself in the series lead, while two-time defending champion Marc Marquez’s struggles this year continued, he crashed out with six laps to go and is now 1+9 points behind in the championship. Cricket now and New Zealand have taken control of the second test against England at Headingley. They lead by 338 runs after day three. Bj Watling scored an unbeaten test century to leave the score on 338 for six at the close, with England having earlier matched the tourists’ first-innings score of 350 all out. Watling hit 100 not out from 137 balls, with 13 fours and a six. The visitors are now heavy favourites to claim a 1-1 series draw over the next couple of days. Staying with cricket, and Pakistan’s hopes of recording a 3-0 whitewash in their one-day series with Zimbabwe were ruined by rain on Sunday. The home side reached 296 for 9 after their 50 overs with Mohammed Hafeez leading the charge with 80, also partnering Azhar Ali to a first wicket stand of over 100. Zimbabwe’s reply only lasted nine overs though. They were at 68 without loss, when a floodlight failure followed by heavy rain forced the game to be abandoned. Soren Kjeldsen has won the Irish Open at Royal County Down by claiming victory on the first play off hole. The Dane, who’s ranked 303 in the world, birdied the par five 18th in a three way tussle involving Austria’s Bernd Wiesberger and England’s Eddie Pepperell after they all finished regulation play tied on 2 under. It’s the first tournament the 1+0-year-old has won since 2009. As you could see coming down the stretch, it means a lot. You know, this is my 18th season and I have never been as nervous because I felt like I wasn’t playing... Well I thought I was striking the ball pretty good but I couldn’t get up and down and couldn’t make any putts and Ifelt and down and couldn’t make any putts and I felt it was and down and couldn’t make any putts and Ifelt it was mine and I felt it was mine to lose, really. Which was a strange situation so I decided not to look at the leader boards but I needed some encouragement and the first one I looked at was at 11 and then I kept looking because I couldn’t believe all the guys were dropping shots as well. It was nice to see every still in the game. -- I was. Australian Steven Bowditch has won the AT&T Byron Nelson on the PGA tour on Sunday. He finished with a final round of 61+ to record an 18 under par total, four shots clear of the field.

Over the next few days we have got some very wet and windy weather in the forecast but before we reached that point I will recap the weather on Sunday. We saw a band of rain and wind sweep across the country, eventually clearing eastwards to leave a mixture of showers with some spells of sunshine. Through the overnight period we will continue to see showers across northern and western areas, some of them went three over the Scottish mountains and it will be breezy. Other areas seeing fewer showers and chilli spots in country areas. At little less cold across southwestern areas. -- a. less cold across southwestern areas.-- a. We areas. -- a. We start the first of june on a bright note but quite cold across central and eastern areas. Showers around south-west England into Wales and the Midlands and some of them could be on the heavy side with winds beginning to pick up at this point as well. Showers across northern England as well with a showery start across Scotland and Northern Ireland with some sun in between. We could start to see more persistent rain pushing him towards Northern Ireland. -- in. We see this deep areas start to push him from the west -- deep areas start to push him from the west-- deep area of low pressure and it will cause many areas to turn wetter and windier with clouds gathering across southern and eastern areas with some shower and southern and eastern areas with some showerand rain shower and rain developing. 15-16 in the Southeast after that bright start, 11-12 elsewhere. For the cricket at Headingly, it will be a dry start with the cloud gathering and outbreaks of rain beginning to push in from the west as the afternoon wears on. It is this unseasonably low pressure which will cause winds up to 60-70 mph in some places and you could see some disruption from this as it moves through. It will still be with us on Tuesday bringing very strong winds and his band of rain is slow to clear from southern and eastern areas. Heavy rain in Scotland and feeling cool in other areas. Another pretty wild day on Tuesday but by Wednesday this area of low pressure moves the way. This area of high pressure moves in from the south to settle things down. Wednesday is a better looking day although there will still be a breeze across northern and eastern areas but it will die down as the day goes on. Elsewhere it will turn drier with warm spells of sunshine. So to recap the new working week, we will start UP the new working week, we will start up wet and windy and midweek it will start to turn drier and slowly, by the end of the week, it will get warmer as well. Welcome to BBC News - broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Daniela Ritorto. Our top stories. Still no deal- US senators continue to debate the possible extension of controversial anti-terror laws. British banks check their records for possible corrupt payments made to FIFA officials. Trapped between Islamic State and government troops - the fate of thousands of Iraqi families hang in the balance. And a new smoking ban comes into force in Beijing. Will it be any more successful than previous efforts? Hello. The United States Senate is holding an urgent session to consider extending controversial surveillance laws just hours before they are due to expire. Key provisions of the Patriot Act will end at midnight in Washington. The laws allow the National Security Agency to carry out the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records and include other measures to track terrorist suspects. From Washington, here’s Tom Bateman. Well, essentially, what we have here in the US is the kind of gridlock that Americans have become used to from politicians. In the past though it has been to do with budget measures or other parts of law. This is the first time that an issue of national security has reached what they call here ""the cliff."" A point in the debate where the measures themselves will expire. They will expire at a minute past midnight here in Washington. Those who want them to remain in place, who include President Obama, say, look, if these measures disappear we will have a gap in our ability to protect the United States. On the other side, a coalition from both sides of the political divide who believe that these measures are overly intrusive. Now, they include Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who himself wants to be president, who has said he is determined to try to use procedural tactics to try to delay this vote to get those powers extended. If that happens it may only be a couple of days until a compromise move, another measure, can be put in place. The supporters of those powers say they will continue to protect the United States. Let’s cross live now to US Security Technologist Bruce Schneier. Thank you for speaking to us. The Senate hearing on debate is still going on. But as far as we can tell from what has happened today, the Patriot Act, as we know it, it is overin Patriot Act, as we know it, it is over in three hours time? It will expire. That does not mean that an essay surveillance expires. -- NSA. But yes, it will expire at the night and for the next few days the section to 15 will not be enforced? Do you see this as a win? Ido. Everyone who has looked at section to 15 has concluded it is not effective. It is not a big win. There are still many ways the NSA can spy on Americans and people overseas. But it is a small when. Do you have Senator Rand Paul to thank for that? you have Senator Rand Paul to thank forthat? He seems you have Senator Rand Paul to thank for that? He seems to be the person doing the most procedurally to make this happen. The US Senate is full of arcane rules. One person can do a lot to stop things happening. It is only going to be a few days, though. The Freedom act will pass the Senate in a few days. Let us discuss that. Tell me the difference between the Patriot Act and the Freedom act which was passed by the House of Representatives and has the backing of President Obama? It looks like it will be the compromise solution. What is the difference? There are a few differences and power around the edges.

But nobody calling back to the US was using a Ss calling back to the US was using a $3 per minute cellphone data. There was no change with the exception of this one minor thing. There are also other divisions. Though and will provisions. -- loan Wolf provisions. The FBI has ways to go after these terrorists without affiliation. There are rules about revving wiretaps. This is very much a symbolic victory. But it is still a symbolic victory. Can Ijust read to you President Obama’s comments? He said, we should not surrender the tools that help keep us safe. Is it a problem with the surveillance or the lack of transparency with the way the agencies have been collecting information? It is a couple of things. It is overly broad, overly invasive. We do not have any visibility into these claims. There are claims that the country will go down in flames and we will wake up Monday morning and everyone will be dead. It is ridiculous. These claims being made, we expect to see some justification. There is no transparency, no understanding why these provisions are important. They also happen to be unconstitutional. Fifa president Sepp Blatter is the victim of a conspiracy from behind the scenes. That’s what his daughter told the BBC amid the corruption crisis gripping world football. The re-elected Fifa president has not been implicated but faces calls to stand down. From Zurich, Richard Conway reports. Let’s go, Fifa! Thank you. For now, Sepp Blatter fights on. Despite the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history, he confounded his critics by winning the presidential election and insists only he can restore trust in football’s world governing body. He is also happy that everything is gone and it’s finished. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Corinne Blatter, the Fifa leader’s only daughter and a close confidant, believes last week’s events are the work of those plotting, ultimately, to oust her father. Does he really think this is a conspiracy between Britain and America? I wouldn’t say from the Americans and the British, but certainly people working behind the scenes, yes, absolutely. Dark forces? I don’t know if you want to call them ""dark forces"". They really tried hard. Everything started last year. In September, October, everything started already then. They tried, a lot. Following last week’s dawn raids, US prosecutors say one of the many allegations concerns a $10 million bribe, wired from a Fifa account to help secure the 2010 South African World Cup. Sepp Blatter has denied any involvement in that and his daughter insists that he is not corrupt. Nobody is without any fault. But the things he has done, so far, he is not a person, and I would really like to say that, he is not a person who is taking money. All the money he earned, he earned it by working. And he is a hard-working president. His character is not like that. He is not taking any money. Is he concerned about being arrested? No. We talked about that this morning, no, he’s not concerned about that. If law enforcement agencies do want him to co-operate, do want to question him, will he say yes to that? I don’t know. You’ll have to ask him that. 73 football associations voted against Sepp Blatter. But with his mandate renewed for another four years, his family believe his legacy now depends on healing a divided sport. Thousands of families in Iraq are trapped by fighting between so-called Islamic State extremists and government forces. Human rights groups say the government, which is dominated by Shia Muslims, is discriminating against Sunni Muslims displaced by IS militants, who are themselves Sunnis. They are attempting to escape from Anbar province, where IS fighters recently captured the key city of Ramadi. From Anbar Orla Guerin reports. Advancing on Islamic State in Anbar Province. Fighters from a Shia militia on the frontline in recent days. They may be a bigger threat to Islamic State than the Iraqi army. For those trying to flee the insurgents, this bridge over the Euphrates is a key escape route from Anbar Province, or it should be. Now there is more commercial traffic getting in than desperate civilians getting out. But this man and his family have just managed to leave Fallujah after pleading with Islamic State for two months. I begged them, he told me, I gave them medical reports to prove I need surgery. On the way out we had to hide from airstrikes and walk for nine hours in the desert. A tent city across the river is as far as many of Anbar’s Sunni Muslims can get because the Shia led government is limiting access to Baghdad. This is where many of those who fled from Islamic State are stranded, some have already been here for two months and the conditions are grim. They are at the mercy of punishing heat. Families here say they are getting little or no help and feel abandoned by their government. Many, like this man, are running on empty. He is worried for his heavily pregnant wife, and four children. So worried, he is thinking of fleeing again, back to Islamic State. TRANSLATION: If this situation continues with high temperatures and no services all of us will go back. Most went already because we had nothing here. For now, more than 200 families remain here. Victims of Islamic State and Iraqi bureaucracy. A key architect of US strategy in Iraq has told the BBC that IS is a formidable enemy, but can be beaten. David Petraeus, a retired US four-star general and former CIA director, warned that a political as well as military solution was needed to defeat the militant group. Speaking exclusively to our diplomatic correspondent, jonathan Marcus, the former commander of American forces in Iraq said that the loss of the town of Ramadi two weeks ago was a major setback. But he expected it to be retaken shortly. I think when you sustain a reverse or significant setbacks like the loss of Ramadi, which was notjust an operational loss, the loss of the Anbar operational command headquarters as well, but a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative, the reality of Islamic State being on the defensive, of losing, was shown to be somewhat hollow as well. Ido think, actually, Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks, if not shorter, but this was a big setback. So, what does the US in particular need to do to get this strategy back on track? We have to recognise that while we must indeed regain the momentum against Islamic State on the battlefield, on the front lines of this fight, there also has to be a major effort in Baghdad where the real centre of gravity lies in this fight. You cannot deal with an industrial strength extremist insurgents problem just with the force of arms, you need the political component as well. As important as arms are, and indeed recognising that they must be killed or captured, defeated, but to enable that, it will require political initiatives on the part of those key Iraqi leaders, starting of course with Prime Minister Abadi who knows what needs to be done to give the Sunni Arab community a reason to support the new Iraq, rather than oppose it. They question the will of the Iraqis to fight. Do you think the Iraqi military can perform? I think it can with good leadership and the support of Baghdad and the empowerment that comes from all of that. During the search and in the years after that, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country in vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know they can fight and we know they will fight but they will only fight if they have good leadership and indeed they have the support and knowledge that somebody has their back when they get into a tough fight. There’s full background and analysis, plus video and audio content and a special section on Islamic State. Go to bbc.com/news. Stay with us on BBC News - still to come. After a month and a half-long heatwave blamed for over 2,000 deaths, it appears India’s high temperatures are about to end. Let’s take a look at the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The Financial Times reports that General Motors is trying to avoid a future backlash over vehicle defects by detecting problems early. They’ve hired a thousand people to scour social media to pick up potential issues before even ten people have been affected. The top story on China Daily is that it’s now against the law to smoke in all indoor public places, primary and middle schools, sports stadiums and hospitals for children. In the South China Morning Post, one of China’s top military representatives says Beijing is not establishing an air defence zone in the disputed South China Sea. According to Gulf News, Narendra Modi will become the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel. A date has not been finalised. If you like travel, North Korea has recently lifted its six month ban over fears of the spread of Ebola. The japan Times reports the North hopes tourism will increase tenfold in the next two years. This is BBC News. I’m Daniela Ritorto. The latest headlines: The Senate in Washington has failed to pass legislation that would allow the National Security Agency to continue to gather telephone call records, but senators are debating a compromise bill. Fifa president Sepp Blatter is the victim of a conspiracy from ""behind the scenes."" That’s what his daughter told the BBC amid the corruption crisis gripping world football. China has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world, with more than 300 million smokers. But from today, those in Beijing are banned from lighting up in public places. Smokers breaking the law will face fines of up to $30. But as our China correspondent, Martin Patience, now reports, this isn’t the first time the capital has tried to kick its habit. China. A smoker’s paradise, a country that consumes a third of the world’s cigarettes. More than half the men smoke here but at what cost? A million people die a year from smoking related illnesses. Now Beijing says it wants to quit for good. The capital is banning smoking in public places, including at restaurants like this one. The thing is, there have been smoking bans before but they haven’t worked and what is surprising about China is the way that people just break the rules. If they want a cigarette, theyjust pull one out, light one up and smoke away but authorities say that this time around things are going to be different and if you do smoke in a public place, you will face a heavy fine. TRANSLATION: I think the ban would be hard to enforce in China. There are simply too many smokers. TRANSLATION: If you really want to ban smoking, you should shut down the cigarette factories. If they ban smoking then I’m not coming to Beijing. TRANSLATION: Smoking in public places harms everyone. I think the ban can work but everyone needs to be on board. Smoking was once common amongst China’s leaders. Chairman Mao and his successor were rarely seen without a cigarette in hand. But the current president, Xi jinping, has bucked the trend. He has quit and that is because the government finally realises the cost of smoking say antitobacco campaigners. TRANSLATION: Tobacco taxes are a huge source of revenue for the government. The costs of treating smoking-related illnesses are now higher. The President talks about the Chinese dream but he says that, first of all, you must be healthy. If you smoke and fall sick, there will be no Chinese dream. But talking about quitting and actually doing it are two different things. And China is bound to suffer nicotine withdrawals during the process. Russia has criticised European politicians for making public a list of people it has banned from entering the country. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said similar bans had been issued against US citizens, but the Americans had acted more constructively and kept them secret. The list contains the names of 89 politicians and high-ranking officials. Nick Higham has more. Ukraine today, somewhere near Donetsk, and renewed fighting in a dismal conflict that nothing making it stop, including EU sanctions which involve travel bans in place on 150 high-ranking Russians. Now the Russians have retaliated. Saying, effectively, you ban ours, we will ban yours. Britons on the list include Nick Clegg, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, john Soares , former head of MI6 and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. The Russian blacklist has left many of those on it amused, -- The Russian blacklist has left many of those on it bemused, like this former Bulgarian ambassador to Moscow. I was surprised because the company is quite distinguished. I was humbled by the presence of the Vice Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. And this Belgian politician. Should I be flattered that Mr Putin really noticed my work? Me, as a simple Flemish MP? Well, apparently he did. The Kremlin has not published the names of those it has banned and accuses the West of leaking them to make a political point. Here, at the Foreign Office in London, they say there is no justification for this list. And if Russia thinks this is the way for the EU to change its mind about sanctions, then it’s wrong. The way to get the sanctions lifted, they say, is for Russia to take its troops out of Ukraine. Most on the list have been openly critical of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, including this former UK Defence Minister. It’s rather depressing that Russia’s resorting to these Soviet style tit-for-tat expulsions, as there used to be 1+0 years ago. They should be focusing on the Minsk Agreement to bring peace to Ukraine. Meanwhile, as Russia and the EU engage in their tit-for-tat war of words, the real war goes on. Three Ukrainian soldiers and two civilians died today. john Kerry has entreated overnight in Geneva after breaking his leg while cycling in the French Alps. He will return to the United States for further treatment. The State Department says he has broken his right leg but did not lose consciousness. Thousands of schools, which were damaged during April’s devastating earthquake in Nepal, have begun to re-open. More than 25,000 classrooms in the capital, Kathmandu, and a dozen surrounding districts, were destroyed in the 7.8 magnitude quake and its continuing aftershocks. joanna jolly reports. It’s the first day they’ve returned to classes after the earthquake in April. When it hit, Nepal’s schools were on their weekend break. But extensive damage to thousands of buildings, like his famous high school in the capital Kathmandu, meant classes were cancelled. Now Nepal’s government wants students to go back to their books. We have to start. There’s no choice. Because education means future. If you don’t start now, it is going to affect your future. That’s what we are planning to start. Officials say it’s important for children to return to a normal routine. For many, this means studying in temporary classrooms built from tarpaulins and bamboo. We are seeing at least some temporary learning centres established, like this one, and children have started coming back to school. The United Nations has provided special educational kits and games to the children. It’s hoped these will help students overcome the psychological trauma of the disaster. The government says it may take another two to three years to rebuild schools properly. Until then, Nepalese are doing the best they can to keep classes going. Forecasters are predicting that a month-and-a-half long heatwave that has been punishing India is about to end. More than 2,000 people have died from the temperatures that have reached more than 1+0 Celsius. Lucas de jong reports. How to beat a heat wave that has plagued your country for more than a month? Rule one, stick to the shade. Rule number two, month? Rule one, stick to the shade. Rule numbertwo, cover-up. Raw numberthree, drink liquids. Plenty number three, drink liquids. Plenty of liquids numberthree, drink liquids. Plenty of liquids -- rule. In India, where the unrelenting heat has caused waters orjudges and where money is short and people have to work to survive, they are rules that are easier said than done -- shortages. TRANSLATION: What can we do? We are poor. If we don’t work, how will we feed ourselves? TRANSLATION: Our clothes are drenched in sweat. If we load more material on the card, it is difficult to pull. It is hot and sunny. This region has been hit the hardest with 1500 people dying in the last month and a half. This neighbouring city has also seen a large number of deaths. TRANSLATION: I cannot bear the heat. What can we do? Power cuts make it difficult in the day. I can’t bear it any more. Thunderstorms brought some relief over the weekend but for southern India, the end is forecast to be near. The monsoon season is bearing down on the country and with it comes the much welcomed calling embrace of the monsoon rains. -- cooling. just before we go, I’d like to show you some of the colour from Arsenal’s celebration of their victory in the English FA Cup on Saturday. They held a traditional winners parade through North London. They beat Aston Villa 1+-0 at Wembley to secure a record breaking 12th title. They’re now the most successful club in FA Cup history. Despite the rain, they still look quite happy. Thank you for watching BBC News. And you can get in touch with me and the team on Twitter. I’m @danielaritorto. See you soon. Over the next few days we have got some very wet and windy weather in the forecast, but before we reach that point I will recap the weather on Sunday. We saw a band of rain and wind sweep across the country, eventually clearing eastwards to leave a mixture of showers with some spells of sunshine. Through the overnight period we will continue to see showers across northern and western areas, some of them wintry over the Scottish mountains, and it will be breezy. Central and eastern areas seeing fewer showers and chilly spots in COUI’IlIây BFEBS. A little less cold, though, across southwestern areas. We start the first ofjune on a bright note but quite cold BCFOSS CEI’IlIâ8l and £8StEIâI’I BFEBS. Showers around south-west England, into Wales and the Midlands and some of them could be on the heavy side with winds beginning to pick up at this point as well. Showers across northern England as well with a showery start across Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some sun in between. We could start to see more persistent rain pushing in towards Northern Ireland by this point. Through the day, we see this deep area of low pressure start to push in from the west and it will cause many areas to turn wetter and windier with clouds gathering across southern and eastern areas with some shower and rain developing. Definitely turning down hill as the afternoon moves on. 15-16 in the south-east after that bright start, 11-12 elsewhere. For the cricket at Headingly, it will be a dry start with the cloud thickening and outbreaks of rain beginning to push in from the west as the afternoon wears on. It is this unseasonably low pressure which will cause winds up to 60-70 mph in some places, and you could see some disruption from this as it moves through. It will still be with us on Tuesday, bringing very strong winds and this band of rain is slow to clear from southern and eastern areas. Heavy rain across Scotland and feeling cool in other areas. 18 or 19 across the south-east corner. Another pretty wild day on Tuesday but by Wednesday this area of low pressure moves out of the way. This area of high pressure moves in from the south to settle things down. Wednesday is a better looking day although there will still be a breeze across northern and eastern areas but it will die down as the day goes on. Elsewhere it will turn drier with warm spells of sunshine. Temperatures, 13 to 19, maybe 20 degrees in the south-east. So to recap the new working week, we will start off wet and windy and midweek it will start to turn drier and slowly, by the end of the week, it will get warmer as well. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Daniela Ritorto. The US National Security Agency has started switching off systems monitoring telephone calls of American citizens after the Senate failed to pass legislation that would allow it to continue gathering the data. Senators are debating a compromise bill which is expected to be passed later this week. Human rights activists are accusing the Iraqi authorities of preventing thousands of people reaching safer parts of the country after fleeing fighting in Anbar province. The activists say the government, which is dominated by Shia Muslims, is discriminating against Sunni Muslims displaced by Islamic State militants. The daughter of FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told the BBC that her father is the victim of a conspiracy from behind the scenes. Mr Blatter, who was re-elected to his post last week, has not been implicated in an ongoing corruption investigation by the American authorities, but faces calls to stand down. Now on BBC News, it’s time for HARDtalk. Welcome to HARDtalk. Britain wants change in the European Union, or it might quit. Greece says it needs more help or it could leave the shared currency. As the EU ceased to be the inevitable destiny of Europe as Denmark might best Guy Verhofstadt dreamt of. Belgium’s former Prime Minister will play a key role in the negotiations the British Prime Minister hasjust begun. Does he think a two speed Europe is a price worth paying? Guy Verhofstadt, welcome to HARDtalk. Greece leaving the eurozone, the UK leaving the EU. Suddenly those ideas that cannot be dismissed entirely as fantasy. It no longer looks as an insoluble union. Do you think the European Union has reached a Cross holds with macros? I think it has reached a crossroads. First of all you have Greece and then this request by the British government to renegotiate. I think it is the right moment to discuss it. We are still in the middle of an economic crisis in Europe. We have created a very complex, very difficult to understand for people what the European union is really about. I think we have to be open to face these challenges. You wrote just last month that the European Union has become a series of opt ins, opt outs. And the union is stuck with fundamental contradictions, a monetary union without a treasury and only 18 part of the true free-trade area. Even all of that, the pressures and contradictions greater than the things holding the union together? I think the core of the European Union is still very important. The internal market, the current currency, the advantages of all these instruments. It is also piece on the continent, but us not forget that. For more than 60 years we have had piece on this continent. But we cannot continue by creating more and more in circles, new European Unions. We have at least ten different European Unions. Some member states are not participating in a number of policies. And countries outside the European Union, laxative and, are participating. -- like Switzerland. Maybe the request by the British government, by David Cameron, to renegotiate the membership of Britain, isn’t opportunity to clarify it and give possibilities to those countries who want to go forward and have the opportunity to do so. There are people who would challenge whether the EU is the reason for peace in Europe, whether it is a happy coincidence. But I want to pick up on what this new Europe might look like. Is there an alternative to not in not out, but some kind of new relationship or countries like Britain that are chafing at the current arrangements? In the 50s when we started with this whole movement, there was the idea to introduce two types of membership. Full membership, countries who are participating in all policies, monetary policy, economic policy, foreign policy, defence and so on. And then what some people called an associative membership. Memberstates some people called an associative membership. Member states who only want to participate in the internal market, for examples. That could be a solution. I am against, to respond to the request of the British government, creating a number of new opt outs. How many can you have? There are limits to that. It is a better way to discuss openly the possibility of to have associated members and full members. The implications are quite significant. He said Britain was able to accept associated membership, they would have little or no say in how the rules are decided. Britain will not continue to cough up millions of euros of funding to the European Union if it finds itself in a situation where it has two be a recipient of decisions taken by others. You have to make a choice. You cannot be outside a number of policies, wanting to be out and also ask for a continuation of the debate and be around the table and take every decision. It is clear when an associative member wants to be part of the internal market, it is clear that Britain wants to be part of that. But if they do not want to be in the monetary union, they cannot decide on the walls. There could still be hit by them. -- affected by them. That is why it some governments are saying, decisions taken by the members of the single currency could have an effect on how the single market works will members who are not part of it. I agree. But decisions taken by the American government affect Britain and the internal markets. There is no safer and Europeans on American policies. I think we need a closer co-operation and more integrated Europe inside the euro area. We cannot establish a monetary union without an economic and political union. I also think the British government understands that. I am very open. My message is, let us start a series of debates about the request of the British government. But the British government has to understand that next to the shopping list of the British government, there has to be a wish list, a number of reforms that are desperately needed by the European Union. Especially by the economic and monetary union. Right, so quid pro quo. Let us talk about the shopping list that David Cameron might be about to propose at the forthcoming summit. just before we do that, you suggested the British renegotiation will lead to a major treaty change. That might surprise some people. Many readers have been saying, we do not want a treaty change. A treaty change process is unmanageable and it is better if we proceed as some kind of governmental arrangement. I think treaty change is necessary. It is the only way. The reason why a number of political leaders and Europe do not want a treaty change is because they have fear from treaty change is because they have fearfrom political procedures. Fear from the people, some would say. We know what happened in front of the Netherlands. A constitutional change was not accepted by the population. A lot of political leaders have fear from treaty change. But if you want to tackle the problems inside the European Union, it is necessary to do it in a good way, in a fundamental way, a structural way. It is necessary to open the discussion about the treaties as they are now. David Cameron has begun his tour of European capitals. Are you hoping to meet him to discuss what he is planning? Ido not know if he wants to see me. I have already had a meeting with Mr Hammond. The British Foreign Minister. The British Foreign Minister about this. I know very well what the request of the British government. A number of them are very difficult. For example, from the British government side, they want to get rid of the free movement of labour inside the European Union. I think we shall have a problem that is very difficult to overcome. Labour mobility inside the European Union is already very low, ten times lower inside the European Union and the labour mobility inside United States of America. Instead of going further down, we have an economic interest to increase labour mobility and free movement of labour. You have taken us into the areal and free movement of labour. You have taken us into the area I wanted to talk about, a list of his proposals. There is one, an important one. Hang on a minute, limits were imposed by several members were eight Central European countriesjoined in members were eight Central European countries joined in 2001+. countriesjoined in 2001+. It is a fundamental principle of the union. One of several countries did not observe for several years. There is a transition period. It does not make a problem, let us be honest. One of the people in the British elections, Nigel Farage, said 21 million will come to the UK. That was an enormous problem. In reality, it was 22,000 Bulgarians and Romanians who came. It is not a fundamental problem. Labour mobility is ten times lower inside the union that in the US. The problem is welfare shopping. That is done by migrants. The British government has a possibility. So the moratorium on the citizens from 80 EU country cramming benefits or social housing. Would you be prepared to consider that? This is completely in the hands of the United States of the European Union. If a certain part of the population is putting an excessive burden on the security system of the country, that country, inside the regulations, has the right to limit social benefits, welfare shopping to these migrants. That is already possible. My point is, the British government should take responsibility if there are problems. I wonder if that is the case, that there is complete freedom for countries to do what they like. The Polish Prime Minister said after she met David Cameron, I told him that Paul’s working in Great Britain contribute to GDP growth, they are honest workers and I would like them to be treated the same way as others. You say it is possible for them to treat any new migrant workers from other than the countries under a different set of rules? That is what you seem to be saying. That is what I am saying. On top of that, I will give you examples. There are countries, like mY examples. There are countries, like my own, who are already doing that. Several thousand people in a wrong way of benefiting from a number of social benefits and advantages in the Social Security system. If you allow that, it does not affect the free movement of labour. That is what I want to make clear. If the British government is asking to help them in tackling welfare shopping, I say yes. If the request of the British government is to limit free movement of labour, I say, no way. It is a fundamental principle of the European Union and already to date it is far too low. The Financial Times as -- says Europe should move towards the EU. Someone coming to Britain from another EU country who cannot find a job should go home. Would that be acceptable? There are far better solutions than pushing people outside the country. One of the ideasis outside the country. One of the ideas is to establish, that should be a good response to the request of Mr Cameron, European insurance in case of unemployment. To tackle this on the European level. It is because we have 28 different unemployment insurance schemes, labour mobility, only one tenth of what labour mobility is in the US. The consequence is we have 2 million vacancies for the moment inside the EU because of the low mobility. That is to use a European solution, than to continue with 28... (CROSSTALK). Eurosceptics will say that an attempt to get onto new territory, new powers for Europe. We have different systems. Fundamentally different systems. Fu ndamentally different. different systems. Fundamentally different. Contribute very system. -- contributory. Mayl different. Contribute very system. -- contributory. May I give you an example? The US is that system. You have a federal basis, insurance against unemployment for three months. The Federal government can extend it to six months like it did for example after the financial crisis of 2008 when people had difficulties finding jobs. crisis of 2008 when people had difficulties findingjobs. On difficulties finding jobs. On top of that, of the 50 states, they can add additional schemes and systems. Why cannot we do this? That should solve the problem of Mr Cameron. He shall not be confronted with people coming especially to Britain to have advantages from the very well-organised unemployment insurance scheme that exists. The French Foreign Minister told French radio he found this process dangerous. Do you? That’s because he was one of the people leading the no camp. You will remember that, in the referendum on the Constitutional Treaty in 2005. Maybe he has a bad conscience about what he did. He asked the French citizens to vote against the Constitutional Treaty, not because he found it was bad, but because he wanted to attack the right-wing majority of Mr Shirac, who was in power. He says he has fear. I can understand. Ten years ago, he was leading those people who wanted to vote down the Constitutional Treaty. What are the consequences of Britain leaving? There was some research done by the Bertelsmann foundation, very distinguished foundation, published in April, concluding the bottom line is everyone involved would lose economically and politically from the UK leaving the EU even a powerful country like Germany. Germany should have a loss of more or less 50 billion euros, naturally the biggest loss should be for Britain, because that study demonstrated the loss should be for 300 billion for the UK. And so, I am puzzled by the fact why the government of Britain is not giving more details about this basic study that they did a few months ago about the fundamental question, what are the consequences and opinions of Britain leaving the European Union. You say they have already done this work and should publish it? Exactly. This work has been done already a while ago and it calls it the balance of competence review, and this review is a Whitehall report thatis this review is a Whitehall report that is indicating very clearly that everybody is in favour of membership of the UK in the EU. And they have asked the opinions of everybody, the opinion of the japanese government, they have thousands of companies in the UK, and all of them have said that they have to stay in the EU and the internal market. They have said, we have to stay inside the European Union. Let me put you the contrary, Daniel Hallen, British MEP, says we can get it by voting to leave, striking the same bargain as the Swiss or the channel islanders who remain successful despite being outside the EU, Common market, not comment government. That is the consequence of a two tier membership of the European Union. That’s what we were talking about in the beginning of the programme. The consequence of this is that Britain shall not decide on a number of common policies that are also in their interest. It’s one or the other. Or you have the full membership and you decide on everything. I think that’s what the British population likes most. Then you have this idea of some backbenchers on the Conservative Party, who want a system to be part of the internal market, but they don’t decide on the common policies. That is what is the most important thing in what was said, there is an internalfight in the thing in what was said, there is an internal fight in the Conservative Party of what is the way forward. Let’s leave it to them. Let’s talk about something that’s very important in terms of an internal conflict in the EU, that is the fate of Greece and the survival of it as a member of eurozone. The head of the IMF said a few days ago that a Greek exit is a possibility, although probably not meaning the end of the eurozone if it happens. How do you rate that possibility? It is difficult to tell you because nobody is really informed about the details in the negotiations between the European Union on one side and grease on the other side. Looking from the outside, my impression is that they will find agreement at the end, the union on one side and the Greek government. The problem is this new Greek government is apparently not willing to present a number of structural reforms in Greek society, because honestly those problems in Greece are mainly caused by corruption, by the system. Is your sense of this, negotiations, ultimately, those who have given grease money will bleed first? I think so. Creditors are willing to make a deal but they are expecting at least fundamental structural reforms proposed by the Greek government and for the moment the only proposals we have seen from them, or in fact -- are in fact increasing taxation on whatever service and whatever citizens. That said, I think that eight Grexit is a problem not for the EU but for the Greek citizens because they have already paid a huge bill, a huge amount in the crisis the last years by the previous Greek government. If they go outside the euro, they are going to reintroduce a national currency, and that shall devalue immediately 30-35% towards the euro. That means an enormous loss of power for every ordinary Greek citizen. For them, for every ordinary Greek citizen. Forthem, it For them, it is the worst scenario. Let me ask you about the broader European picture. Is the evidence of the summer collections to the institution to which you serve, European parliament, and domestic elections that have happened since, that Europeans, and notjust Brits and grumpy Greeks, have become disillusioned with you? It is contradicted by the last polls that have been published in 2011+. Vaults are real, not a snapshot. They are cast. -- votes. The exit poll in Britain was very good, let’s be honest, OK. When you look at Greece, Syriza took a quarter of the votes, the 5-star movement in Italy took 20% of votes, we have had... (CROSSTALK). I am took 20% of votes, we have had... (CROSSTALK). Iam not (CROSSTALK). I am not denying this. What is the message? I have to tell you, 20% in Italy, 30% in grief, 15% in the Netherlands, that’s not a majority. -- Greece. If you look at the studies that make up public opinion, we see the majority of Europeans want to continue with the euro and they want, with 75%, to start European defence. I don’t think the problem for the moment in Europe are public opinion. The problem for the moment are the national elite governing the countries and not having the courage to conform with European solutions for European problems. , thanks for being with us on HARDtalk. -- Guy Verhofstadt, thanks for being with us on HARDtalk. Over the next few days we have got some very wet and windy weather in the forecast, but before we reach that point I will recap the weather on Sunday. We saw a band of rain and wind sweep across the country, eventually clearing eastwards to leave a mixture of showers with some spells of sunshine. Through the overnight period we will continue to see showers across northern and western areas, some of them wintry over the Scottish mountains, and it will be breezy. Central and eastern areas seeing fewer showers and chilly spots iI’I COUI’IlIây BFEBS. A little less cold, though, across southwestern areas. We start the first ofjune on a bright note but quite cold BCFOSS CEI’IlIâ8l and £8StEIâI’I BFEBS. Showers around south-west England, into Wales and the Midlands and some of them could be on the heavy side with winds beginning to pick up at this point of the morning. Showers across northern England too and a showery start across Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some sun in between. We could start to see more persistent rain pushing in towards Northern Ireland by this point. Through the day, we see this deep area of low pressure start to push in from the west and it will cause many areas to turn wetter and windier with clouds gathering across southern and eastern areas with some shower and rain developing. Definitely turning down hill as the afternoon moves on. 15-16 in the south-east after that bright start, 11-12 elsewhere. For the cricket at Headingly, it will be a dry start with the cloud thickening and outbreaks of rain beginning to push in from the west as the afternoon wears on. It is this unseasonably low pressure which will cause winds up to 60-70 mph in some places, and you could see some disruption from this as it moves through. It will still be with us on Tuesday, bringing very strong winds and this band of rain is slow to clear from southern and eastern areas. Heavy rain across Scotland and feeling cool in other areas. 18 or 19 across the south-east corner. Another pretty wild day on Tuesday but by Wednesday this area of low pressure moves out of the way. This area of high pressure moves in from the south to settle things down. Wednesday is a better looking day although there will still be a breeze across northern and eastern areas but it will die down as the day goes on. Elsewhere it will turn drier with warm spells of sunshine. Temperatures, 13 to 19, maybe 20 degrees in the south-east. So to recap the new working week, we will start off wet and windy and midweek it will start to turn drier and slowly, by the end of the week, it will get a little bit warmer too. Welcome to BBC News - broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Daniela Ritorto. Our top stories. No deal- the US senate fails to pass an extension to controversial surveillance laws, but a compromise bill is still alive. Trapped between Islamic State and government troops - the fate of thousands of Iraqi families hang in the balance. The daughter of FIFA boss Sepp Blatter tells the BBC her father is the victim of a conspiracy from behind the scenes. And a new smoking ban comes into force in Beijing. Will it be any more successful than previous efforts? Hello. The US Senate has failed to prevent the expiry in a few hours’ time of anti-terrorist laws that let security services collect telephone data. In a rare Sunday debate senators could not agree on extending the current surveillance laws and are now debating a replacement bill to introduce more closely targeted security measures. From Washington, here’s the BBC’s Tom Bateman. Well, essentially, what we have here in the US is the kind of gridlock that Americans have become used to from politicians. In the past though it has been to do with budget measures or other parts of law. This is the first time that an issue of national security has reached what they call here ""the cliff."" A point in the debate where the measures themselves will expire. They will expire at a minute past midnight here in Washington. Those who want them to remain in place, who include President Obama, say, look, if these measures disappear we will have a gap in our ability to protect the United States. On the other side, a coalition from both sides of the political divide who believe that these measures are overly intrusive. Now, they include Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who himself wants to be president, who has said he is determined to try to use procedural tactics to try to delay this vote to get those powers extended. If that happens it may only be a couple of days until a COITIpI’oITIiSE I’|'IOVE, 8I’Ioti’IEIâ ITIEBSUFE, can be put in place. The supporters of those powers say they will continue to protect the United States. A short time ago I spoke to Bruce Schneier, a Security Technologist based in Minneapolis. He told me that while the Patriot Act will expire in the next few hours, it doesn’t mean an end to NSA surveillance. It will expire. But yes, it will expire at midnight and for the next few days the section 215 will not be enforced. Do you see this as a win? I do. Everyone who has looked at section 215 has concluded it is not effective. It is not a big win. There are still many ways the NSA can spy on Americans and people overseas. But it is a small win. Do you have Senator Rand Paul to thank for that? He seems to be the person doing the most procedurally to make this happen. The US Senate is full of arcane rules. One person can do a lot to stop things happening. It is only going to be a few days, though. The Freedom Act will pass the Senate in a few days. Let us discuss that. Tell me the difference between the Patriot Act and the Freedom Act which was passed by the House of Representatives and has the backing of President Obama? It looks like it will be the compromise solution. What is the difference? There are a few differences around the edges. The thing that might be the biggest news was collecting cellphone metadata. That is not going to happen under the Freedom act. But nobody calling back to the Middle East was using a $3 per minute cellphone data. They are using calling cards. All the other bulk collection happens. There was no change with the exception of this one minor thing. There are also other provisions. For example, the lone wolf provisions. These have been used exactly no times in the past. The FBI has ways to go after these terrorists without affiliation. There are rules about roaming wiretaps. This is very much a symbolic victory. But it is still a symbolic victory. Can Ijust read to you President Obama’s comments? He said, we should not surrender the tools that help keep us safe. Is it a problem with the surveillance or the lack of transparency with the way the agencies have been collecting information? It is a couple of things. It is overly broad, overly invasive. We do not have any visibility into these claims. There are claims that the country will go down in flames and we will wake up Monday morning and everyone will be dead. It is ridiculous. These claims being made, we expect to see some justification. There is no transparency, no understanding why these provisions are important. They also happen to be unconstitutional. Thousands of families in Iraq are trapped by fighting between so-called Islamic State extremists and government forces. Human rights groups say the government, which is dominated by Shia Muslims, is discriminating against Sunni Muslims displaced by IS militants, who are themselves Sunnis. They are attempting to escape from Anbar province, where IS fighters recently captured the key city of Ramadi. From Anbar Orla Guerin reports. Advancing on Islamic State in Anbar Province. Fighters from a Shia militia on the frontline in recent days. They may be a bigger threat to Islamic State than the Iraqi army. For those trying to flee the insurgents, this bridge over the Euphrates is a key escape route from Anbar Province, or it should be. Now there is more commercial traffic getting in than desperate civilians getting out. But this man and his family have just managed to leave Fallujah after pleading with Islamic State for two months. I begged them, he told me, I gave them medical reports to prove I need surgery. On the way out we had to hide from airstrikes and walk for nine hours in the desert. A tent city across the river is as far as many of Anbar’s Sunni Muslims can get because the Shia led government is limiting access to Baghdad. This is where many of those who fled from Islamic State are stranded, some have already been here for two months and the conditions are grim. They are at the mercy of punishing heat. Families here say they are getting little or no help and feel abandoned by their government. Many, like this man, are running on empty. He is worried for his heavily pregnant wife, and four children. So worried, he is thinking of fleeing again, back to Islamic State. TRANSLATION: If this situation continues with high temperatures and no services all of us will go back. Most went already because we had nothing here. For now, more than 200 families remain here. Victims of Islamic State and Iraqi bureaucracy. A key architect of US strategy in Iraq has told the BBC that IS is a formidable enemy, but can be beaten. David Petraeus, a retired US four-star general and former CIA director, warned that a political as well as military solution was needed to defeat the militant group. Speaking exclusively to our diplomatic correspondent, jonathan Marcus, the former commander of American forces in Iraq said that the loss of the town of Ramadi two weeks ago was a major setback. But he expected it to be retaken shortly. I think when you sustain a reverse or significant setbacks like the loss of Ramadi, which was notjust an operational loss, the loss of the Anbar operational command headquarters as well, but a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative, the reality of Islamic State being on the defensive, of losing, was shown to be somewhat hollow as well. Ido think, actually, Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks, if not shorter, but this was a big setback. So, what does the US in particular need to do to get this strategy back on track? We have to recognise that while we must indeed regain the momentum against Islamic State on the battlefield, on the front lines of this fight, there also has to be a major effort in Baghdad where the real centre of gravity lies in this fight. You cannot deal with an industrial strength extremist insurgents problem just with the force of arms, you need the political component as well. As important as arms are, and indeed recognising that they must be killed or captured, defeated, but to enable that, it will require political initiatives on the part of those key Iraqi leaders, starting of course with Prime Minister Abadi who knows what needs to be done to give the Sunni Arab community a reason to support the new Iraq, rather than oppose it. They question the will of the Iraqis to fight. Do you think the Iraqi military can perform? I think it can with good leadership and the support of Baghdad During the search and in the years after that, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country in vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know they can fight and we know they will fight but they will only fight if they have good leadership and indeed they have the support and knowledge that somebody has their back when they get into a tough fight.

The opposition in Burundi has called for street protest after the government failed to call the President to abandon his call to seek re-election. The President’s decision has sparked protest. Pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong have met Chinese officials in a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences over electoral reform in the territory. Beijing plans to introduce direct elections, but only with a restricted list of candidates.

After a month and a half-long heatwave blamed for over 2,000 deaths, it appears India’s high temperatures are about to end. Let’s take a look at the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The Financial Times reports that General Motors is trying to avoid a future backlash over vehicle defects by detecting problems early. They’ve hired a thousand people to scour social media to pick up potential issues - before even ten people have been affected. The top story on China Daily is that it’s now against the law to smoke in all indoor public places, primary and middle schools, sports stadiums and hospitals for children. In the South China Morning Post one of China’s top military representatives says Beijing is not establishing an air defence zone in the disputed South China Sea. According to Gulf News, Narendra Modi will become the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel. A date has not been finalised. If you like travel, North Korea has recently lifted its six month ban over fears of the spread of Ebola. The japan Times reports the North hopes tourism will increase tenfold in the next two years. This is BBC News. Here are the headlines: The US Senate has failed to pass anti- terror laws that would allow security services to continue gathering telephone data. The White House has told senators to make this lapse as short lived as possible. And not welcome in their own country. We have a special report on refugees who have fled from Islamic State in Iraq. Sepp Blatter is the victim of a conspiracy from behind the scenes. That is what his daughter has told the BBC amid the corruption crisis 9ri+>+>iÂ9 the BBC amid the corruption crisis gripping world football. He has not been implicated, but he faces calls to stand down. Let’s go, Fifa! Thank you. For now, Sepp Blatter fights on. Despite the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history, he confounded his critics by winning the presidential election and insists only he can restore trust in football’s world governing body. He is also happy that everything is gone and it’s finished. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Corinne Blatter, the Fifa leader’s only daughter and a close confidant, believes last week’s events are the work of those plotting, ultimately, to oust her father. Does he really think this is a conspiracy between Britain and America? I wouldn’t say from the Americans and the British, but certainly people working behind the scenes, yes, absolutely. Dark forces? I don’t know if you want to call them ""dark forces"". They really tried hard. Everything started last year. In September, October, everything started already then. They tried, a lot. Following last week’s dawn raids, US prosecutors say one of the many allegations concerns a $10 million bribe, wired from a Fifa account to help secure the 2010 South African World Cup. Sepp Blatter has denied any involvement in that and his daughter insists that he is not corrupt. Nobody is without any fault. But the things he has done, so far, he is not a person, and I would really like to say that, he is not a person who is taking money. All the money he earned, he earned it by working. And he is a hard-working president. His character is not like that. He is not taking any money. Is he concerned about being arrested? No. We talked about that this morning, no, he’s not concerned about that. If law enforcement agencies do want him to co-operate, do want to question him, will he say yes to that? I don’t know. You’ll have to ask him that. 73 football associations voted against Sepp Blatter. But with his mandate renewed for another four years, his family believe his legacy now depends on healing a divided sport. Russia has criticised European politicians for making public a list of people it has banned from entering the country. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said similar bans had been issued against US citizens, but the Americans had acted more constructively and kept them secret. The list contains the names of 89 politicians and high-ranking officials. Nick Higham has more. Ukraine today, somewhere near Donetsk, and renewed fighting in a dismal conflict that nothing seems able to stop, including EU sanctions which involve travel bans in place on 150 high-ranking Russians. Now the Russians have retaliated. Saying, effectively, you ban ours, we will ban yours. Britons on the list include Nick Clegg, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, Sirjohn Soares , former head of MI6 and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. The Russian blacklist has left many of those on it bemused, like this former Bulgarian ambassador to Moscow. I was surprised because the company is quite distinguished. I was humbled by the presence of the Vice Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. And this Belgian politician. Should I be flattered that Mr Putin really noticed my work? Me, as a simple Flemish MP? Well, apparently he did. The Kremlin has not published the names of those it has banned and accuses the West of leaking them to make a political point. Here, at the Foreign Office in London, they say there is no justification for this list. And if Russia thinks this is the way for the EU to change its mind about sanctions, then it’s wrong. The way to get the sanctions lifted, they say, is for Russia to take its troops out of Ukraine. Most on the list have been openly critical of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, including this former UK Defence Minister. It’s rather depressing that Russia’s resorting to these Soviet style tit-for-tat expulsions, as there used to be 1+0 years ago. They should be focusing on the Minsk Agreement to bring peace to Ukraine. Meanwhile, as Russia and the EU engage in their tit-for-tat war of words, the real war goes on. Three Ukrainian soldiers and two civilians died today. Thousands of schools, which were damaged during April’s devastating earthquake in Nepal, have begun to re-open. More than 25,000 classrooms in the capital, Kathmandu, and a dozen surrounding districts, were destroyed in the 7.8 magnitude quake and its continuing aftershocks. joanna jolly reports. It’s the first day they’ve returned to classes after the earthquake in April. When it hit, Nepal’s schools were on their weekend break. But extensive damage to thousands of buildings, like his famous high school in the capital Kathmandu, meant classes were cancelled. Now Nepal’s government wants students to go back to their books. We have to start. There’s no choice. Because education means future. If you don’t start now, it is going to affect your future. That’s what we are planning to start. Officials say it’s important for children to return to a normal routine. For many, this means studying in temporary classrooms built from tarpaulins and bamboo. We are seeing at least some temporary learning centres established, like this one, and children have started coming back to school. The United Nations has provided special educational kits and games to the children. It’s hoped these will help students overcome the psychological trauma of the disaster. The government says it may take another two to three years to rebuild schools properly. Until then, Nepalese are doing the best they can to keep classes going. China has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world, with more than 300 million smokers. But from today, those in Beijing are banned from lighting up in public places. Smokers breaking the law will face fines of up to $30. But as our China correspondent, Martin Patience, now reports, this isn’t the first time the capital has tried to kick its habit. China... A smoker’s paradise, a country that consumes a third of the world’s cigarettes. A million people die a year from smoking related illnesses. Now Beijing says it wants to quit for good. The capital is banning smoking in public places, including at restaurants like this one. The thing is, there have been smoking bans before but they haven’t worked and what is surprising about China is the way that people just break the rules. The thing is, there have been smoking bans before but they haven’t worked and what is surprising about China is the way that people just break the rules. If they want a cigarette, theyjust pull one out, light one up and smoke away, but authorities say that this time around things are going to be different, and if you do smoke in a public place, you will face a heavy fine. TRANSLATION: I think the ban would be hard to enforce in China. There are simply too many smokers. TRANSLATION: If you really want to ban smoking, you should shut down the cigarette factories. If they ban smoking then I’m not coming to Beijing. TRANSLATION: Smoking in public places harms everyone. I think the ban can work, but everyone needs to be on board. Smoking was once common amongst China’s leaders. Chairman Mao and his successor were rarely seen without a cigarette in hand. But the current president, Xi jinping, has bucked the trend. He has quit and that is because the government finally realises the cost of smoking, say antitobacco campaigners. TRANSLATION: Tobacco taxes are a huge source of revenue for the government. The costs of treating smoking-related illnesses are now higher. The President talks about the Chinese dream but he says that, first of all, you must be healthy. If you smoke and fall sick, there will be no Chinese dream. But talking about quitting and actually doing it are two different things. And China is bound to suffer nicotine withdrawals during the process. Forecasters are predicting that a month-and-a-half long heatwave that has been punishing India is about to end. More than 2,000 people have died from the temperatures that have reached more than 1+0 Celsius. Lucas de jong reports. How to beat a heat wave that has plagued your country for more than a month? Rule one, stick to the shade. Rule number two, cover-up. Rule number three, drink liquids. Plenty of liquids. In India, where the unrelenting heat has caused water shortages, and where money is short and people have to work to survive, there are rules that are easier said than done. TRANSLATION: What can we do? We are poor. If we don’t work, how will we feed ourselves? TRANSLATION: Our clothes are drenched in sweat. If we load more material on the cart, it is difficult to pull. It is very hot and sunny. Andhra Pradesh region has been hit the hardest with 1500 people dying in the last month and a half. Neighbouring Telangarna city has also seen a large number of deaths. TRANSLATION: I cannot bear the heat. What can we do? Power cuts make it difficult in the day. I can’t bear it any more. Thunderstorms brought some relief over the weekend, but for southern India, the end is forecast to be near. The monsoon season is bearing down on the country and with it comes the much-welcomed cooling embrace of the monsoon rains. prevent the expiry in the hours of counterterrorism legislation allowing mass collection of telephone data. Senators have agreed to debate further a compromised bill called the Freedom Act. We have received a White House statement, the Senate has taken an important, if late, step forward and we call on the Senate to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authority is as short lived as possible. The American people deserve nothing less. We’ve got much more coming up on BBC News - stay with this. Over the next few days we have got some very wet and windy weather in the forecast, but before we reach that point I will recap the weather on Sunday. We saw a band of rain and wind sweep across the country, eventually clearing eastwards to leave a mixture of showers with some spells of sunshine. Through the overnight period we will continue to see showers across northern and western areas, some of them wintry over the Scottish mountains, and it will be breezy.

The daughter of FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told the BBC that her father is the victim of a conspiracy from ‘behind the scenes.' Mr Blatter, who was re-elected to his post last week, has not been implicated in an ongoing corruption investigation by the American authorities, but faces calls to stand down. We will be back with another full bulletin at four o’clock. Now on BBC News it’s time for Dateline London. Hello and welcome to Dateline London. Fifa and the future of world football under the continuing guidance of its dear leader Sepp Blatter. Plus the British Government begins the long process of renegotiating membership of the European Union. My guests today are a UK-based jamiacanjournalist, Stephanie Baker of Bloomberg Markets, an Arab writer and broadcaster and Ian Birrell of the Mail on Sunday. Very good to see you. Well, rather like a scene from Eliot Ness and The Untouchables raiding a meeting of Mafia dons, the FBI hit football’s governing body this week with corruption charges just as Fifa was planning another coronation for its boss Sepp Blatter. The corruption charges were good news said Fifa, bravely claiming they helped the organisation clean up world football. Mr Blatter was promptly re-elected. Is Fifa beyond shame and redemption? I think it is beyond shame but I am not sure about redemption. It is interesting to see what has happened in the last few days with Fifa. You look at the people who voted for Fifa in the camps. You have the European Football Federation in one camp and you have the Caribbean, Latin American and North American voters in another camp and those from Asia in another. CONCACAF. It tells us clearly what is happening in world football. It’s divided into camps - them and us. That’s why Blatter is so confident in his position. He is looking after the interests of those on the African continent, the Caribbean, Latin America, North America and the Asian continent. So he thinks. Therefore, he doesn’t have to worry about the European continent. That is why you get this split and he is so confident and almost cocky in terms of his reaction. But I think it bodes very, very badly for football. Particularly within the Latin American, African and Caribbean world. It is the start of what could come in terms of corruption. It happened in cricket as well. Cricket was found to be corrupt in the past. So was football and horse racing. This is what happens when money becomes the primary focus of events like the World Cup. To take the unusual step of being pro-Blatter. He has 132 votes, he has helped developing countries get a piece of the football action, he could say Qatar is important for having the World Cup in an Arab country and in other countries around the world. Not just South Americans and Europeans. Some achievements, he can say. Under his leadership, the revenue of Fifa has ballooned, and that has been part of his power base. He has seen billions flow into Fifa over the past 17 years. He has used it to operate a system of patronage, kicking back the money to developing countries to develop football. The World Cup in Brazil took in five billion and Fifa kicked back about one billion. And that’s his basis of support. The money is key here. If Fifa is going to change, the sponsors really need to band together and put pressure on Fifa to reform itself. They are facing exposure themselves. Not only from associating themselves with a sort of tarnished brand but I bet their lawyers are telling them, this is looking a little dicey for you and you had better step back because it could look like colluding in the sense of the 5 billion that Brazil’s World Cup took in, around 30% was through marketing and sponsorship. And, of the sponsors which have criticised in the past week, Visa issued the most strongly worded warning. I think there is scope, that is definitely the way... And they must be thinking it even if they are not saying it publicly because it must tarnish them being associated with something in such trouble? And they lost some sponsors, Sony and Emirates. I haven’t seen any others come storming back in. If you threaten to take away the funding, then you take away the source of revenue they have used, that Blatter has used to support himself. How do you think it’s seen in many Arab countries? Qatar has the World Cup but a jordanian prince was the opponent to Sepp Blatter. He didn’t get far, did he? The Arab countries were involved in this kind of saga. Badly involved. First, Qatar was accused of bad treatment of foreign workers. Also Prince Ali was supported by everybody except most of the Arab countries, which is another scandal. And there was the move to freeze Israeli membership. Because of the bad treatment of the Palestinian players in particular. So I think we are heading towards a huge crisis. We will face it for the coming ten years at least. I don’t believe it will go away and Sepp Blatter will have the energy or time to clear this mess as he promised. Talking about the Arab world, I am surprised and shocked, a man in his 80s and his fifth term, he reminds me of a dictator, we need a Fifa Spring. Seriously, if you look at it. He is very old. Why did he not leave this job two terms ago? Age is immaterial in this case. It’s not about age but the position he has taken. Back to sponsorship and developing countries, the Caribbean and other places, this is where things are corrupt about how football is governed right now. You talked about Qatar, and these things seem to be brushed under the carpet, where so many workers have been killed preparing for their participation in the World Cup, and those are the issues which should be tackled. Going back to the question about redeeming itself, unless we get to the heart of those critical, ethical and corrupt practices, we will not move forward. We have not seen a Fifa Spring, though. Perhaps the opposite? Either he is complicit or incompetent and he shouldn’t be doing the job he is doing. Fifa is the culprit of all this. It has to be remembered. All the money is being stolen, if it is being stolen, from Fifa. The idea he is benefiting Africa is entirely wrong. He is not, actually. I like the fact that Burundi has as much power as Britain, Ido not see a problem. It is great that it is not another Western-run organisation. The other side is that the people he is benefiting are not the footballers on the ground but the football chiefs. You can see that on the ground. You travel round Africa and there is an amazing boom in football but not all of it is getting through. It is disappearing at the top. What Fifa sets there you are seeing across the board. This is what has been created. You have Uefa threatening to have their own event every two years. Like they usually do but wider.. Copa, the South American equivalent, they have it and they have extended it to include countries not in the southern region of South America. So YOU i’13VE two C3TT’IpS. Almost like black and white issues going on. When you look at what happened in Zurich, the people gathered around Blatter are mostly from the Caribbean, Africa and some Asian countries. Uefa is not exactly clean. There are lots of questions about Platini and accusations about him and Putin. It is about the corrupting power of extreme money. If you’re right... This is alot about money at the core of it. Follow the money and you will find out who is corrupt and not. Can you imagine the World Cup, one of the great sporting brands, not being the World Cup but being a Uefa competition or Copa competition or some kind of breakaway? Can you really imagine that? It will be hard. Part of the reason why the sponsors have stuck by them is that it is one way to reach 30 billion people. A unique opportunity. There are not many other alternatives. It doesn’t sound like Uefa members are willing to boycott the World Cup. It may not come to that, at least not immediately. It’s not hard. I’m not saying that they should not. In America they have a World Cup that is not the world. It is only held within the American states. How can something different... Copa has done it, Uefa have their own, so why not? Sometimes on this programme you have been critical of American authorities but should we cheer the FBI for doing something? LAUGHTER. Everyone around the world is talking about British journalists uncovering the stories. The FBI seem to have decided that this is their bag. I believe it is a political move from the FBI. They definitely had this information a long time ago. Maybe they were waiting for Blatter to step down but he did not. So they decided to go at him. If they had all this information, why did they wait until now? They waited because that is the way the US Attorney operates. They wanted to dot all the i’s, cross all the t’s. When they bring the charges, it is done. They have an airtight case. They have some of the top financial crime investigators in the world. And you wonder... The Serious Fraud Office here did absolutely nothing and yet three British-based banks were named in the indictment. Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered. There was cash flowing through and the FBI had to act. I would say yes, they waited because they wanted it to be watertight but the British Serious Fraud Squad were very much part of the investigation. With all the knowledge they had before, I think the timing is interesting. Exactly. They waited for this conference in Zurich to take place and I think it was part of their strategy. This was perfect timing in terms of publicity. Notjust on the tightening... -- Not just on the tightening... -- timing. It is interesting that British journalists asked some of the toughest questions of Blatter and the Sunday Times in many ways broke the story. Quite a good day for British journalism given the last few years has been not so good. Panorama has done great work over the years. British journalists did very well on this. People have not been listening to them a lot. To the credit of the US authorities, there has been a massive fraud going on in their territory and they have acted. There have been questions about why the British authorities did not act. We all knew it was absurd that Qatar got the World Cup. There were no grounds except for money. Absolutely none, football, commercial or any other. There are also questions over whether Russia should be allowed to have it. Not just on financial grounds but they have invaded another European country. Vladimir Putin gave Sepp Blatter a great deal of support. That says all you need to know. The deaths of people in Qatar are shameful, aren’t they? Shameful. They should not be treated how they are. They should have full rights. The sponsor system in the Gulf is appalling, it’s shameful and should be removed completely. It is not the problem of Qatar, they were awarded the tournament to host it. Who is responsible? I believe it is Fifa itself. They should actually look at the whole situation, the weather, the treatment of foreign workers, but it seems they did not. Maybe Blatter awarded the tournament to South Africa, maybe he wanted to give it to an Arab country. A Middle Eastern country. This is what is interesting... It is an ongoing struggle and we will know more in the next couple of weeks. The US Attorney General says there are likely to be more arrests made. In the Caribbeanjack Warner was arrested. We know his sons have been implicated in corruption going back to money laundering. This is only the start of it. We will see a lot more. You talk about Blatter, he is like Teflon, nothing sticks, but I think we need to watch this space. But are the sporting authorities really going to destroy the World Cup and are footballers going to play, are sponsors going to cough up or are we going to see a lot of headlines and more arrests but we willjust see the World Cup take place anyway in Brazil almost unashamedly as it is, take place in Moscow and possibly even Qatar. Is anything ultimately going to happen? Or is money going to talk? I would think some sponsors would be worried being associated with the Russian and Qatar World Cups. I’m sure other sponsors would come in. In Britain this week, we got a flavour of what the politics of the next 18 months will look like. Dominated by the government’s determination to re-negotiate Britain’s terms of membership of the European Union. While some British voters care deeply about Europe, most don’t vote in European elections and put the issue way down their list of priorities after the economy, jobs, health, education and other matters. So how far will voters really engage in this debate? And how far is it mostly the conservative party talking to itself and trying to see off UKIP? Those people who care about this care about it very deeply. It is of massive interest to a small minority on the right. One of David Cameron’s most famous lines was to stop banging on about Europe. But because of the rise of Ukip, he had to keep offering bones to them, then the biggest bone of all, which is the referendum. We are stuck with that and we will have the referendum. I hope this will lines that boil. But as we saw in Scotland, referendums do not do that. We will be dominated for the next 18 months by this. But there are some interesting questions raised. And support in places like Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, for some issues, about red tape, extending the market in areas like the digital economy, issues about having closer union written into the treaties. Some interesting issues which should be debated. And if you wanted to be optimistic like me, we could, at the end of it, have improvements made to Europe. Equally, it is easy to be pessimistic. Some of those issues you have mentioned are not even at the heart of most British voters who will hopefully take part, and taking part in the referendum, because if you think about the election that took place people were more concerned in terms of Europe about key things such as immigration... Immigration hardly featured, it is jobs and the economy. Exactly. The more you talk about Europe, the more Ukip has become a toxic brand, quite rightly in my opinion. The fact Ukip has pushed this means people do not want to be on the same side. It is possible it may be an easier debate than anticipated. To widen it, the optimistic point, it is true in every country in Europe, particularly the northern countries like Germany, that there is appetite for change and reform, but not an appetite to do it the way David Cameron is doing it. This is the bizarre thing I do not understand, why David Cameron set the bar so high demanding the treaty changes. Something that he knows is opposed in many European countries and will be hard to achieve. If it is treaty change, the eurosceptics and Ukip will branded a failure. And a fraud. The board, would they say that whatever he comes back with? He could go down the line without treaty change. And some of the benefit changes could be done without treaty change. And what is nice to see is him trying to provide some leadership within Europe, especially in the past election, where foreign affairs featured only in a very minor way, during the debate. But you might see broadly the centre left and right, coalescing on a yes vote. And others towards the left and far right. And if that is correct, Britain will stay in the EU. I think Cameron would like Britain to stay. I believe he indicated that. Angela Merkel is responding positively to his demands. They do not want Britain to leave the union. It will dismantle the whole thing. I believe there is bargaining here. Cameron would like to get something in order to give to the sceptics that, yes, I promise that this referendum, I’ve got a lot of changes here. He played the immigration cards. European immigrants should not get their benefits here. Claim benefits immediately if unemployed. He is trying to please eurosceptics. And I believe he got the backing of Angela Merkel who does not want Britain to leave the union during her time. He is looking for a face saving formula. And he hopes that Europe will help them to get it by some reforms. I do not believe they will change the treaty. But as you mention, he will have some changes. I know people who are broadly fans of David Cameron, in his party, but he is not a brilliant strategist. The referendum could go wrong. And a series of stopgap measures could cause a different problem, such as Ukip. Some of his strategy has been flawed from the start. In order to get some people from the right on board, they have said they will pull out of a certain group into another. A tactic which turned into a headache. We have seen that again and again. From the start, he should have been much tougher on the right. They could have done that. It was clear what the trajectory of Ukip would be. Ukip led the way. Putting the gauntlet down and deciding what the British people wanted from Europe, as far as they were concerned. David Cameron has fallen, Ukip have said. You could fight them or appease them. He is in a different position. When he accepted the referendum, he was struggling. Now he has the majority in the government and is the key man. He promised this is his final term. He does not want to end his political life pulling out from Europe. Or lose the referendum and be forced to resign. Prominent business people have said it would be good for Britain to get out of the EU. Do you see, broadly, the business lobby weighing heavily? Definitely. The vast majority of the business community is for Europe and they are concerned about the uncertainty of pulling out. The referendum gives rise to that. In the Scottish referendum, you saw businesses coming out strongly, warning of risks and possible job losses. Businesses could halt investments and it could be a drag on economic growth in the next year or two. That is why David Cameron wants to push ahead with the referendum sooner, by the end of 2017, it could be made to go to 2016, during European capitals and how much coalition he can build for treaty change or maybe working out a better relationship between the Eurozone countries and the others. That is a difference between big and small businesses. Maybe some small businesses would be quite hostile. You often do not hear of the smaller voices. In terms of strategy, Mr Cameron will have to change. As we get nearer to the date, the argument is what we have a stake in with Europe? Or what we will lose if we come out? That has not been publicised in any effective way. That is where Mr Cameron’s strategy has to change. A couple of minutes left. Where are we now with Islamic State? Making some gains on the ground. How is it that they are continuing not just to survive but to extend? Going back to the Americans, the Americans were telling us for the last five months or so that Isis is shrinking. Then they have managed to capture one of the third biggest cities in Iraq. And also the historical city in Syria. Two big cities. They have more than seven big cities in Syria and Iraq. How have they managed to do so? Simply because the Iraqi army is very weak, the American bombardment is not effective, 3700 air soldiers, Isis, Islamic State, is getting stronger. They have got armaments and money, and more people. They are gaining strength after strength. Consolidating their grip on half of Syria now, maybe two thirds, and also about half of Iraq. As it seems they are preparing the grounds to attack Baghdad. 60 miles from Baghdad. Isn’t it lack of co-ordination between Arab governments? This is also part of the problem. Many were dependent on the Americans taking the lead. But America, Britain and other European countries are not willing to do that. The problem is America changes their priorities. In the beginning, they said their priority was to topple the Assad regime, then they changed the priority to root out Islamic State, now they are back under Saudi and Turkish pressures to topple the Assad regime. This is playing into the hands of Islamic State. How important is that having Turkey and Qatar uniting and backing arrival force against Assad? That seems to have gained ground? About 30 seconds left. That is important. They are gaining ground. They have taken places such as Aleppo. They are preparing the mother of all battles against Aleppo. But we will have two parts of Islamic State, in the eastern north-west. Which one should we side with? It is a problem. Thank you for cheering everyone up! LAUGHTER. That’s it for Dateline London for this week. We’re back next week at the same time time. You can comment on the programme on Twitter @gavinesler. Goodbye. Temperatures will fall away thunder clear skies overnight especially in central and southern and eastern areas. We start on a cool and bright note in southern and eastern parts. Showers in the north and west and then conditions go downhill as gale force winds develop across the west with heavy and persistent rain. Across the Southeast corner it is staying dry until after dark but it turns very wet and windy with strong winds and rain overnight into the early hours of Tuesday thanks to this unseasonable area of low pressure. We could see gale force winds across Scotland. A wild looking day on Tuesday with an area of low pressure close by. Rain in many areas and temperatures quite widely at 16 degrees. We start the new week on a wet and windy note but the area of high pressure moves in and starts to settle things down, turning things quite a bit warmer by the end of the week. ~ Welcome to BBC News, broadcasting at home and around the globe. I’m Daniela Ritorto. Our top stories: No deal, The White House says a failure by US senators to reach a deal on controversial surveillance laws is ""irresponsible"". Trapped between Islamic State and government troops, the fate of thousands of Iraqi families hangs in the balance. The daughter of FIFA boss Sepp Blatter tells the BBC her father is the victim of a conspiracy from ‘behind the scenes’. And, a new smoking ban comes into force in Beijing. Will it be any more successful than previous efforts? Thank you forjoining us. It’s a dilemma that America has been wrestling with since the attacks of 911, striking the right balance between security and freedom. The latest venue for this debate, the floor of the United States Senate. Law- makers there have failed to prevent the expiry of controversial surveillance law, that allow the National Security Agency to collect telephone data from American citizens. The White House has called on the Senate to end what it calls ‘this irresponsible lapse in authorities’. From Washington, here’s Tom Bateman. Well, essentially, what we have here in the US is the kind of gridlock that Americans have become used to from politicians. In the past though it has been to do with budget measures or other parts of law. This is the first time that an issue of national security has reached what they call here ""the cliff."" A point in the debate where the measures themselves will expire. Those national security measures are due to expire at a minute past midnight here in Washington. Those who want them to remain in place, who include President Obama, say, look, if these measures disappear we will have a gap in our ability to protect the United States. On the other side, a coalition from both sides of the political divide who believe that these measures are overly intrusive. Now, they include Senator Rand Paul, a Republican who himself wants to be president, who has said he is determined to try to use procedural tactics to try to delay this vote to get those powers extended. If that happens it may only be a couple of days until a compromise move, another measure, can be put in place. The supporters of those powers say they will continue to protect the United States. The part of the law that allows the mass collection of telephone data is called Section Two-fifteen. Bruce Schneier is a security technology expert based in Minneapolis. I asked him if he saw these developments as a win. ~ I do. And Ido. And everyone has I do. And everyone has looked at section to 15 of the review groups, concluding it is not affected. -- 215. It is not a big win, there are many ways that the NSA is spying on Americans and people overseas, but it is a small win and we have to take what we can get. And do you have Senator Rand Paul to thank for that? He seems to be the person who is doing the most procedurally to make this happen. The US Senate is full of old rules and one person can do a lot to stop things from happening. It will only be a few days though. It seems pretty clear that the USAF Reid will pass the Senate in a few days. Lets discuss that. -- freedom act. Tell us the difference between the Patriot Act and the freedom act which was passed by the House of Representatives, it has the backing of President Obama. It looks like it will be the compromise solution that will come UP compromise solution that will come up in a few days time. What is the difference? There are a few and they are around the edges. The things that made the biggest news about the Patriot Act was collecting meta data. That will not happen under the freedom act, but if you think about it, nobody is calling out to the Middle East using a cellphone plan. They are using calling cards, Skype, all the other baulk collection that was done under 215 still happens under the freedom act. There is no change, with the exception of this one minor thing. change, with the exception of this one minorthing. -- bulk. As we’ve heard, one of the most vocal opponents of extending these laws is Republican senator, Rand Paul. jed Babbin is a former US Deputy Undersecretary of Defence who served during the first Bush administration. He is very critical of Senator Paul’s stance. Quite friendly, his objection on the basis of something that he finds in the Constitution is frivolous because he is a constitutional illiterate. The courts have repeatedly held again and again. What we are talking about is meta data, the two phone numbers involved in a call and the length. That is all it is, there is a recording of the phone call, listening in on people. This is not warrantless wiretapping. And the fourth Amendment does not say anyone owns the meta data. It is the phone bill, thatis the meta data. It is the phone bill, that is all it is. Quite friendly, his constitutional objection is frivolous, going back to at least 1979 when those meta data, so-called, were ruled by the United States Supreme Court to not be the person’s property. The fourth Amendment requires that no person’s house, person, data oraffects, papers or affects are invaded without a search warrant. And that is what has gone on since the revolution. And the basic won’t hear is, that is not out it is not our person, it is not our affects, but meta data does not Bulong to individual people, only the phone company. He is ignorant of the Constitution and his objections are entirely frivolous. -- belong. Thousands of families in Iraq are trapped by fighting between so-called Islamic State extremists and government forces. Human rights groups say the government, which is dominated by Shia Muslims, is discriminating against Sunni Muslims displaced by IS militants, who are themselves Sunnis. They are attempting to escape from Anbar province, where IS fighers recently captured the key city of Ramadi. From Anbar, Orla Guerin reports. Advancing on Islamic State in Anbar Province. Fighters from a Shia militia on the frontline in recent days. They may be a bigger threat to Islamic State than the Iraqi army. For those trying to flee the insurgents, this bridge over the Euphrates is a key escape route from Anbar Province, or it should be. Now there is more commercial traffic getting in than desperate civilians getting out. But this man and his family have just managed to leave Fallujah after pleading with Islamic State for two months. I begged them, he told me, I gave them medical reports to prove I need surgery. On the way out we had to hide from airstrikes and walk for nine hours in the desert. A tent city across the river is as far as many of Anbar’s Sunni Muslims can get because the Shia led government is limiting access to Baghdad. This is where many of those who fled from Islamic State are stranded, some have already been here for two months and the conditions are grim. They are at the mercy of punishing heat. Families here say they are getting little or no help and feel abandoned by their government. Many, like this man, are running on empty. He is worried for his heavily pregnant wife, and four children. So worried, he is thinking of fleeing again, back to Islamic State. TRANSLATION: If this situation continues with high temperatures and no services all of us will go back. Most went already because we had nothing here. For now, more than 200 families remain here. Victims of Islamic State and Iraqi bureaucracy. A key architect of US strategy in Iraq has told the BBC that IS is a formidable enemy, but can be beaten. David Petraeus, a retired US four-star general and former CIA director, warned that a political, as well as military solution, was needed to defeat the militant group. Speaking exclusively to the BBC’sjonathan Marcus, he said the loss of the town of Ramadi two weeks ago was a major set back. But he expected it to be retaken shortly. I think when you sustain a reverse or significant setbacks like the loss of Ramadi, which was notjust an operational loss, the loss of the Anbar operational command headquarters as well, but a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative, the reality of Islamic State being on the defensive, of losing, was shown to be somewhat hollow as well. Ido think, actually, Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks, if not shorter, but this was a big setback. So, what does the US in particular need to do to get this strategy back on track? We have to recognise that while we must indeed regain the momentum against Islamic State on the battlefield, on the front lines of this fight, there also has to be a major effort in Baghdad where the real centre of gravity lies in this fight. You can’t deal with an industrial-strength extremist insurgent problem just with the force of arms, you need the political component as well. As important as arms are, and indeed recognising that they must be killed or captured, defeated, but to enable that, it will require political initiatives on the part of those key Iraqi leaders, starting of course with Prime Minister Abadi who knows what needs to be done to give the Sunni Arab community a reason to support the new Iraq, rather than oppose it. Ashton Carter questioned the will of the Iraqis to fight. Do you think the Iraqi military can perform? I think it can with good leadership and the support of Baghdad and the empowerment that comes from all of that. During the search and in the years after that, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country in vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know they can fight and we know they will fight but they will only fight if they have good leadership and indeed they have the support and knowledge that somebody has their back when they get into a tough fight. Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, is the victim of a conspiracy from ‘behind the scenes’. That’s what his daughter told the BBC, amid the corruption crisis gripping world football. The re-elected Fifa president has not been implicated, but faces calls to stand down. From Zurich, Richard Conway reports. Let’s go, Fifa! Thank you. For now, Sepp Blatter fights on. Despite the biggest crisis in Fifa’s history, he confounded his critics by winning the presidential election and insists only he can restore trust in football’s world governing body. He is also happy that everything is gone and it’s finished. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Corinne Blatter, the Fifa leader’s only daughter and a close confidant, believes last week’s events are the work of those plotting, ultimately, to oust her father. Does he really think this is a conspiracy between Britain and America? I wouldn’t say from the Americans and the British, but certainly people working behind the scenes, yes, absolutely. Dark forces? I don’t know if you want to call them ""dark forces"". They really tried hard. Everything started last year. In September, October, everything started already then. They tried, a lot. Following last week’s dawn raids, US prosecutors say one of the many allegations concerns a $10 million bribe, wired from a Fifa account to help secure the 2010 South African World Cup. Sepp Blatter has denied any involvement in that and his daughter insists that he is not corrupt. Nobody is without any fault. But the things he has done, so far, he is not a person, and I would really like to say that, he is not a person who is taking money. All the money he earned, he earned it by working. And he is a hard-working president. His character is not like that. He is not taking any money. Is he concerned about being arrested? No. We talked about that this morning, no, he’s not concerned about that. If law enforcement agencies do want him to co-operate, do want to question him, will he say yes to that? I don’t know. You’ll have to ask him that. 73 football associations voted against Sepp Blatter. But with his mandate renewed for another four years, his family believe his legacy now depends on healing a divided sport. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come: After a month-and-a-half-long heatwave, blamed for more than 2,000 deaths. It appears India’s high temperatures are about to end. Let’s take a look at the stories making headlines in the newspapers around the world. The Financial Times reports that General Motors is trying to avoid a future backlash over vehicle defects by detecting problems early. They’ve hired 1000 people to scour social media to pick up potential issues, before even ten people have been affected. The top story on China Daily is that it’s now against the law to smoke in all indoor public places, primary and middle schools, sports stadiums and hospitals for children. In the South China Morning Post, one of China’s top military representatives says Beijing is not establishing an air defence zone in the disputed South China Sea. According to Gulf News, Narendra Modi will become the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel. A date has not been finalised. If you like travel, North Korea has recently lifted its six month ban over fears of the spread of Ebola. The japan Times reports the North hopes tourism will increase ten fold in the next two years. This is BBC News. I’m Daniela Ritorto. The latest headlines: The US Senate has failed to agree an extension to controversial anti-terror laws that allow security services to collect telephone data, the White House says it’s an ""irresponsible lapse."" Thousands of families in Iraq are trapped by fighting between so-called Islamic State extremists and government forces. Russia has criticised European politicians for making public a list of people it has banned from entering the country. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said similar bans had been issued against US citizens but the Americans had acted more constructively and kept them secret. The list contains the names of 89 politicians and high-ranking officials. Nick Higham has more. Ukraine today, somewhere near Donetsk, and renewed fighting in a dismal conflict that nothing seems able to stop, including EU sanctions which involve travel bans in place on 150 high-ranking Russians. Now the Russians have retaliated. Saying, effectively, you ban ours, we will ban yours. Britons on the list include Nick Clegg, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, Sirjohn Soares , former head of MI6 and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. The Russian blacklist has left many of those on it bemused, like this former Bulgarian ambassador to Moscow. I was surprised because the company is quite distinguished. I was humbled by the presence of the Vice Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. And this Belgian politician. Should I be flattered that Mr Putin really noticed my work? Me, as a simple Flemish MP? Well, apparently he did. The Kremlin has not published the names of those it has banned and accuses the West of leaking them to make a political point. Here, at the Foreign Office in London, they say there is no justification for this list. And if Russia thinks this is the way for the EU to change its mind about sanctions, then it’s wrong. The way to get the sanctions lifted, they say, is for Russia to take its troops out of Ukraine. Most on the list have been openly critical of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, including this former UK Defence Minister. It’s rather depressing that Russia’s resorting to these Soviet style tit-for-tat expulsions, as there used to be 1+0 years ago. They should be focusing on the Minsk Agreement to bring peace to Ukraine. Meanwhile, as Russia and the EU engage in their tit-for-tat war of words, the real war goes on. Three Ukrainian soldiers and two civilians died today. Some news in brief now: The US Secretary of State, john Kerry, is being treated overnight in a hospital in Geneva after breaking his leg cycling in the French Alps. He’s planning to leave Switzerland shortly and return to the United States for further treatment. The State Department says Mr Kerry had broken a part of his right leg but did not lose consciousness. Early projections from local elections in Italy indicate that the Prime Minister has not received the strong endorsement he wanted in order to push ahead with his reforms. His centre-left Democratic Party looks set to clinch several regional governorships but there were strong performances by other parties. Pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong have met Chinese officials in a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences over electoral reform in the territory. Beijing plans to introduce direct elections, but only with a restricted list of candidates. Legislators left the meeting promising to continue to fight the proposals, which led to led to the ""umbrella"" street protests last year. Forecasters are predicting that a month-and-a-half long heatwave that has been punishing India is about to end. More than 2000 people have died from the temperatures that have reached more than 1+0 degrees celsius. Lucas de jong reports. How to beat a heat wave that has plagued your country for more than a month? Rule one, stick to the shade. Rule number two, cover-up. Rule number three, drink liquids. Plenty of liquids. But in India, where the unrelenting heat has caused water shortages, and where money is short and people have to work to survive, they are rules that are easier said than done. TRANSLATION: What can we do? We are poor. If we don’t work, how will we feed ourselves? TRANSLATION: Our clothes get drenched in sweat. If we load more material on the cart, it is difficult to pull. It is very hot and sunny. Andhra Pradesh region has been hit the hardest with 1500 people dying in the last month and a half. Neighbouring Telangana has also seen a large number of deaths. TRANSLATION: I cannot bear the heat. What can we do? Power cuts make it difficult in the day. I can’t bear it any more. Thunderstorms brought some relief over the weekend, but for southern India, the end is forecast to be near. The monsoon season is bearing down on the country and with it comes the much-welcomed cooling embrace of the monsoon rains. Thousands of schools, which were damaged during April’s devastating earthquake in Nepal, have begun to re-open. More than 25,000 classrooms in the capital Kathmandu and a dozen surrounding districts were destroyed in the 7.8 magnitude quake and its continuing aftershocks. joanna jolly reports. It’s the first day they’ve returned to classes after the earthquake in April. When it hit, Nepal’s schools were on their weekend break. But extensive damage to thousands of buildings, like his famous high school in the capital Kathmandu, meant classes were cancelled. Now Nepal’s government wants students to go back to their books. We have to start. There’s no choice. Because education means future. If you don’t start now, it is going to affect your future. That’s what we are planning to start. Officials say it’s important for children to return to a normal routine. For many, this means studying in temporary classrooms built from tarpaulins and bamboo. We are seeing at least some temporary learning centres established, like this one, and children have started coming back to school. The United Nations has provided special educational kits and games to the children. It’s hoped these will help students overcome the psychological trauma of the disaster. The government says it may take another two to three years to rebuild schools properly. Until then, Nepalese are doing the best they can to keep classes going. China has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world, with more than 300 million smokers. But from today, those in Beijing are banned from lighting up in public places. It’s not the first time the capital has tried to kick its habit as Martin Patience explains. China, a smoker’s paradise, a country that consumes a third of the world’s cigarettes. More than half the men smoke here but at what cost? A million people die a year from smoking related illnesses. Now Beijing says it wants to quit for good. The capital is banning smoking in public places, including at restaurants like this one. The thing is, there have been smoking bans before but they haven’t worked and what is surprising about China is the way that people just break the rules. If they want a cigarette, theyjust pull one out, light one up and smoke away, but authorities say that this time around things are going to be different, and if you do smoke in a public place, you will face a heavy fine. TRANSLATION: I think the ban would be hard to enforce in China. There are simply too many smokers. TRANSLATION: If you really want to ban smoking, you should shut down the cigarette factories. If they ban smoking then I’m not coming to Beijing. TRANSLATION: Smoking in public places harms everyone. I think the ban can work, but everyone needs to be on board. Smoking was once common amongst China’s leaders. Chairman Mao and his successor were rarely seen without a cigarette in hand. But the current president, Xi jinping, has bucked the trend. He has quit and that is because the government finally realises the cost of smoking, say antitobacco campaigners. TRANSLATION: Tobacco taxes are a huge source of revenue for the government. The costs of treating smoking-related illnesses are now higher. The President talks about the Chinese dream but he says that, first of all, you must be healthy. If you smoke and fall sick, there will be no Chinese dream. But talking about quitting and actually doing it are two different things. And China is bound to suffer nicotine withdrawals during the process. And you can get in touch with me and the team on Twitter. I’m @danielaritorto. Thank you for watching BBC News from me and the team in London. We will see you again soon. Over the next few days we have got some very wet and windy weather in the forecast, but before we reach that point I will recap the weather on Sunday. We saw a band of rain and wind sweep across the country, eventually clearing eastwards to leave a mixture of showers with some spells of sunshine. Through the overnight period we will continue to see showers across northern and western areas, some of them wintry over the Scottish mountains, and it will be breezy. Central and eastern areas seeing fewer showers and chilly spots in rural places. A little less cold, though, across southwestern areas. We start the first ofjune on a bright note but quite chilly BCFOSS CEI’IlIâ8l and £8StEIâI’I BFEBS. Showers around south-west England, into Wales and the Midlands and some of them could be on the heavy side with winds beginning to pick up at this point of the morning. Showers across northern England too and a showery start across Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some sun in between. We could start to see more persistent rain pushing in towards Northern Ireland by this point. Through the day, we see this deep area of low pressure start to push in from the west and it will cause many areas to turn wetter and windier with clouds gathering across southern and eastern areas with some shower and rain developing. Definitely turning down hill as the afternoon moves on. 15-16 in the south-east after that bright start, 11-12 elsewhere. For the cricket at Headingly, it will be a dry start with the cloud thickening and outbreaks of rain beginning to push in from the west as the afternoon wears on. It is this unseasonably deep area of low pressure which will cause winds up to 60-70 mph in some places, and we could see some disruption from this as it moves through. It will still be with us on Tuesday, bringing very strong winds and this band of rain is slow to clear from southern and eastern areas. Heavy rain across Scotland and feeling cool in other areas. 18 or 19 across the south-east corner. Another pretty wild day on Tuesday but by Wednesday this area of low pressure moves out of the way. This area of high pressure moves in from the south to settle things down. Wednesday is a better looking day although there will still be a breeze across northern and eastern areas but it will die down as the day goes on. Elsewhere it will turn drier with warm spells of sunshine. Temperatures, 13 to 19, maybe 20 degrees in the south-east. So to recap the new working week, we will start off wet and windy and midweek it will start to turn drier and slowly, by the end of the week, it will get a little bit warmer too. ~ The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Daniela Ritorto. The White House has called members of the US Senate ‘irresponsible’ for failing to prevent the expiry of counter-terrorism legislation. The law allows the National Security Agency to collect telephone data in bulk. Senators have now agreed to debate a Bill to introduce more closely targeted security measures. Human rights activists are accusing the Iraqi authorities of preventing thousands of people reaching safer parts of the country after fleeing fighting in Anbar province. The activists say the government, which is dominated by Shia Muslims, is discriminating against Sunni Muslims displaced by Islamic State militants. The daughter of FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told the BBC that her father is the victim of a conspiracy from ‘behind the scenes’. Mr Blatter, who was re-elected to his post last week, has not been implicated in an ongoing corruption investigation by the American authorities, but faces calls to stand down. We will have another bulletin at five o’clock but now it is time for HARDtalk, goodbye. Welcome to HARDtalk. Britain wants change in the European Union, or it might quit. Greece says it needs more help or it could leave the shared currency. Has the EU ceased to be the inevitable destiny of Europe as some like my guest today, Guy Verhofstadt, dreamt of? Belgium’s former Prime Minister will play a key role in the negotiations the British Prime Minister hasjust begun. Does he think a two-speed Europe is a price worth paying? Guy Verhofstadt, welcome to HARDtalk. Greece leaving the eurozone, the UK leaving the EU. Suddenly those are ideas that cannot be dismissed entirely as fantasy. It no longer looks like an insoluble union. Do you think the European Union has reached a crossroads? I think it has reached a crossroads. It is the first time we have been faced with, first of all you have Greece and then this request by the British government to renegotiate. I think it is the right moment to discuss it. We are still in the middle of an economic crisis in Europe. We have created a very complex, very difficult to understand for people what the European Union is really about. I think we have to be open to face these challenges. You wrote just last month that the European Union has become a series of opt ins, opt outs. And the Union is stuck with fundamental contradictions, a monetary union without a treasury and only 18 part of the true free-trade area. The area for total free movement. After all of that, are the pressures and contradictions greater than the things holding the union together? I think the core of the European Union is still very important. The internal market, the current currency, the advantages of all these instruments. It is also peace on the continent, let us not forget that. For more than 60 years we have had peace on this continent. But we cannot continue by creating more and more inner circles, new European Unions. And so we are at a crossroads. We have at least ten different European Unions. Some member states are not participating in a number of policies. And countries outside the European Union, like Norway and Switzerland, are participating. Maybe the request by the British government, by David Cameron, to renegotiate the membership of Britain, is an opportunity to clarify it and give possibilities to those countries who want to go forward and have the opportunity to do so. There are people who would challenge whether the EU is the reason for peace in Europe, whether it is a happy coincidence. Sol So I don’t want to dwell on that. But I want to pick up on what this new Europe might look like. Is there an alternative to not in not out, but some kind of new relationship for countries like Britain that are chafing at the current arrangements? You have to know... In the 50s when we started with this whole movement, there was the idea to introduce two types of membership. Full membership, countries who are participating in all policies, monetary policy, economic policy, foreign policy, defence and so on. And then what some people called an associative membership. Member states who only want to participate in the internal market, for examples. That could be a solution. For the problems or the request of I am against, to respond to the request of the British government, creating a number of new opt outs. How many can you have and still be a union? There are limits to that. It is a better way to discuss openly the possibility of to have associated members and full members. The implications are quite significant. You said if Britain was able to accept associate membership, they would have little or no say in how the rules are decided. Britain will not continue to cough up millions of euros of funding to the European Union if it finds itself in a situation where it has to be a recipient of decisions taken by others. You have to make a choice. You cannot be outside a number of policies, wanting to be out and also ask for a continuation of the debate and be around the table and make every decision. It is clear when an associative member wants to be part of the internal market, it is clear that Britain wants to be part of that. But if they do not want to be in the monetary union, they cannot decide on the rules. They could still be affected by them. That is why it some governments are saying, decisions taken by the members of the single currency could have an effect on how the single market works for members who are not part of it. I agree. But decisions taken by the American government affect Britain and the internal markets. There is no say for Europeans on American policies. I think we need a closer co-operation and more integrated Europe inside the euro area. We cannot establish a monetary union without an economic and political union. I also think the British government understands that. I am very open. My message is, let us start a series of debates about the request of the British government. But the British government has to understand that next to the shopping list of the British government, there has to be a wish list, a number of reforms that are desperately needed by the European Union. Especially by the economic and monetary union. Right, so quid pro quo. Let us talk about the shopping list that David Cameron might be about to propose at the forthcoming summit. just before we do that, you suggested the British renegotiation will lead to a major treaty change. That might surprise some people. Many leaders have been saying, we do not want a treaty change. A treaty change process is unmanageable and it is better if we proceed as some kind of governmental arrangement. I think treaty change is necessary. It is the only way. The reason why a number of political leaders in Europe do not want a treaty change is because they have fear of the political procedures. Fear of the people, some would say. We know what happened in France and the Netherlands. A constitutional change was not accepted by the population. A lot of political leaders have fear of treaty change. But if you want to tackle the problems inside the European Union, it is necessary to do it in a good way, in a fundamental way, a structural way. It is necessary to open the discussion about the treaties as they are now. David Cameron has begun his tour of European capitals. Are you hoping to meet him to discuss what he is planning? I do not know if he wants to see me. I have already had a meeting with Mr Hammond. The British Foreign Minister. The British Foreign Minister about this. I know very well what the request of the British government are. A number of them are very difficult. For example, from the British government side, they want to get rid of the free movement of labour inside the European Union. I think we shall have a problem that is very difficult to overcome. Labour mobility inside the European Union is already very low, ten times lower inside the European Union than the labour mobility inside United States of America. Instead of going further down, we have an economic interest to increase labour mobility and free movement of labour. You have taken us into the area I wanted to talk about, a list of his proposals. There is one, an important one. Some say, hang on a minute, limits were imposed by several members when eight Central European countries joined in 2001+. It is a fundamental principle of the union. One that several countries did not observe for several years. There is a transition period. It does not make a problem, let us be honest. One of the people in the British elections, Nigel Farage, said 21 million Romanians and Bulgarians will come to the UK. That was an enormous problem. In reality, it was 22,000 Bulgarians and Romanians who came. It is not a fundamental problem. Labour mobility is ten times lower inside the union than in the US. The problem is welfare shopping. That is done by migrants. There the British government has a possibility. This is very interesting... Good... So a four year moratorium on the citizens from an EU country claiming benefits or social housing. Would you be prepared to consider that? This is completely in the hands of the United States of the European Union. If a certain part of the population is putting an excessive burden on the security system of the country, that country, inside the regulations, has the right to limit social benefits, welfare shopping to these migrants. That is already possible. So why. .. My point is, the British government should take responsibility if there are problems. OK. I wonder if that is the case, that there is complete freedom for countries to do what they like. The Polish Prime Minister said after she met David Cameron, I told him that Poles working in Great Britain contribute to GDP growth, they are honest workers and I would like them to be treated the same way as others. Ewa Kopacz, that is. You say it is possible for them to treat any new migrant workers from other EU countries under a different set of rules? That it can do this already. That is what I am saying. On top of that, I will give you examples. There are countries, like my own, who are already doing that. Belgium. Several thousand people in a wrong way of benefiting from a number of social benefits and advantages in the social security system. If you allow that, it does not affect the free movement of labour. That is what I want to make clear. If the British government is asking to help them in tackling welfare shopping, I say yes. If the request of the British government is to limit free movement of labour, I say, no way. It is a fundamental principle of the European Union and already today it is far too low. The Financial Times says Europe should move towards the EU. Someone coming to Britain from another EU country who cannot find a job should go home. Would that be acceptable? There are far better solutions than pushing people outside the country. One of the ideas is to establish, that should be a good response to the request of Mr Cameron, European insurance in case of unemployment. To tackle this on the European level. It is because we have 28 different unemployment insurance schemes, labour mobility, only one tenth of what labour mobility is in the US. The consequence is we have 2 million vacancies for the moment inside the EU because of the low mobility. That is to use a European solution, than to continue with 28... (CROSSTALK). Eurosceptics will say that an attempt to get onto new territory, new powers for Europe. We have different systems. Fu ndamentally different. Contributory system. May I give you an example? The US is that system. You have a federal basis, insurance against unemployment for three months. The federal government can extend it to six months like it did for example after the financial crisis of 2008 when people had difficulties finding jobs. On top of that, of the 50 states, they can add additional schemes and systems. Why cannot we do this? That should solve the problem of Mr Cameron. He shall not be confronted with people coming especially to Britain to have advantages from the very well-organised unemployment insurance scheme that exists. The French Foreign Minister told French radio he found this process dangerous. Do you? That’s because he was one of the people leading the no camp. You will remember that in the referendum on the Constitutional Treaty in 2005. Maybe he has a bad conscience about what he did. He asked the French citizens to vote against the Constitutional Treaty, not because he found it was bad, but because he wanted to attack the right-wing majority of Mr Shirac, who was in power. He says he has fear. I can understand. Ten years ago, he was leading those people who wanted to vote down the Constitutional Treaty. What are the consequences of Britain leaving? There was some research done by the Bertelsmann Foundation, very distinguished foundation, published in April, concluding the bottom line is everyone involved would lose economically and politically from the UK leaving the EU, even a powerful country like Germany. Germany should have a loss of more or less 50 billion euros, naturally the biggest loss should be for Britain, because that study demonstrated the loss should be for 300 billion for the UK. And so, I am puzzled by the fact why the government of Britain is not giving more details about this basic study that they did a few months ago about the fundamental question, what are the consequences and opinions of Britain leaving the European Union. You say they have already done this work and should publish it? Exactly. This work has been done already a while ago and it calls it the Balance of Competence Review, and this review is a Whitehall report that is indicating very clearly that everybody is in favour of membership of the UK in the EU. And they have asked the opinions of everybody, the opinion of the japanese government, they have thousands of companies in the UK, and all of them have said that they have to stay in the EU and the internal market. They have said, we have to stay inside the European Union. Let me put you the contrary view, Daniel Hallen, British MEP, says we can get it by voting to leave, striking the same bargain as the Swiss or the Channel Islanders, who remain successful despite being outside the EU - common market, not comment government. That is the consequence of a two-tier membership of the European Union. That’s what we were talking about in the beginning of the programme. The consequence of this is that Britain shall not decide on a number of common policies that are also in their interest. It’s one or the other. Or you have the full membership and you decide on everything. I think that’s what the British population likes most. Then you have this idea of some backbenchers on the Conservative Party, who want a system to be part of the internal market, but they don’t decide on the common policies. That is what is the most important thing in what was said, there is an internal fight in the Conservative Party of what is the way forward. Let’s leave it to them. Let’s talk about something that’s very important in terms of an internal conflict in the EU, that is the fate of Greece and the survival of it as a member of eurozone. The head of the IMF said a few days ago that a Greek exit is a possibility, although probably not meaning the end of the eurozone if it happens. How do you rate that possibility? It is difficult to tell you because nobody is really informed about the details in the negotiations between the European Union on one side and Greece on the other side. Looking from the outside, my impression is that they will find agreement at the end, the union on one side and the Greek government. The problem is this new Greek government is apparently not willing to present a number of structural reforms in Greek society, because honestly those problems in Greece are mainly caused by corruption, by the system. Is your sense of this, negotiations, ultimately, those who have lent Greece money will bleed first? I think so. Creditors are willing to make a deal but they are expecting at least fundamental structural reforms proposed by the Greek government and for the moment the only proposals we have seen from them are in fact increasing taxation on whatever service and whatever citizens. That said, I think that a Grexit is a problem not for the EU but for the Greek citizens, because they have already paid a huge bill, a huge amount in the crisis the last years by the previous Greek government. If they go outside the euro, they are going to reintroduce a national currency, and that shall devalue immediately 30-35% towards the euro. That means an enormous loss of purchasing power for every ordinary Greek citizen. For them, it is the worst scenario. Let me ask you about the broader European picture. Is the evidence of the summer elections to the institution to which you serve, the European parliament, and domestic elections that have happened since, that Europeans, and not just Brits and grumpy Greeks, have become disillusioned with you? It is contradicted by the last polls that have been published in 2011+. Votes are real, not a snapshot. They are cast. The exit poll in Britain was very good, let’s be honest, OK. When you look at Greece, Syriza took a quarter of the votes, the 5-star Movement in Italy took 20% of votes, we have had... (CROSSTALK). I am not denying this. What is the message? I have to tell you, 20% in Italy, 30% in Greece, 15% in the Netherlands, that’s not a majority. If you look at the studies that make up public opinion, we see the majority of Europeans want to continue with the euro and they want, with 75%, to start European defence. I don’t think the problem for the moment in Europe are public opinion. The problem for the moment are the national elite governing the countries and not having the courage to conform with European solutions for European problems. Guy Verhofstadt, thanks for being with us on HARDtalk. Over the next few days we have got some very wet and windy weather in the forecast, but before we reach that point I will recap the weather on Sunday. We saw a band of rain and wind sweep across the country, eventually clearing eastwards to leave a mixture of showers with some spells of sunshine. Through the overnight period we will continue to see showers across northern and western areas, some of them wintry over the Scottish mountains, and it will be breezy. Central and eastern areas seeing fewer showers and chilly spots in rural places. A little less cold, though, across southwestern areas. We start the first ofjune on a bright note but quite chilly BCFOSS CEI’IlIâ8l and £8StEIâI’I BFEBS. Showers around south-west England, into Wales and the Midlands and some of them could be on the heavy side with winds beginning to pick up at this point of the morning. Showers across northern England too and a showery start across Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some sun in between. We could start to see more persistent rain pushing in towards Northern Ireland by this point. Through the day, we see this deep area of low pressure start to push in from the west and it will cause many areas to turn wetter and windier with clouds gathering across southern and eastern areas with some shower and rain developing. Definitely turning down hill as the afternoon moves on. 15-16 in the south-east after that bright start, 11-12 elsewhere. For the cricket at Headingly, it will be a dry start with the cloud thickening and outbreaks of rain beginning to push in from the west as the afternoon wears on. It is this unseasonably deep area of low pressure which will cause winds up to 60-70 mph in some places, and we could see some disruption from this as it moves through. It will still be with us on Tuesday, bringing very strong winds and this band of rain is slow to clear from southern and eastern areas. Heavy rain across Scotland and feeling cool in other areas. 18 or 19 across the south-east corner. Another pretty wild day on Tuesday but by Wednesday this area of low pressure moves out of the way. This area of high pressure moves in from the south to settle things down. Wednesday is a better looking day although there will still be a breeze across northern and eastern areas but it will die down as the day goes on. Elsewhere it will turn drier with warm spells of sunshine. Temperatures, 13 to 19, maybe 20 degrees in the south-east. So to recap the new working week, we will start off wet and windy and midweek it will start to turn drier and slowly, by the end of the week, it will get a little bit warmer too. Hello you’re watching BBC World News. I’m Naga Munchetty. Our top story - just now US Security agencies have lost the right to collect the telephone data of American citizens in bulk. A rare Sunday meeting by the Senate failed to agree the renewal of the Patriot Act - President Obama says it leaves the country less able to track potential terrorist threats. Welcome to the programme - other stories that we are keeping BCFOSS ‘foI’ yOU. The US Defence Secretary tells the BBC that Britain and other Nato countries must stick to their defence spending commitments. Public smoking is stubbed out in Beijing - now authorities there have to show that they can enforce the ban. I’m Sally Bu ndock. In business, how much can you cut without clipping the wings? Malaysia Airlines will reveal a radical restructuring to end up with a leaner and more efficient business. And, it’s time again - another big debt payment is looming for Greece. How long can it honour its obligations, before the coffers run dry? First, a Sunday sitting of the United States Senate has failed to prevent the expiry of counterterror legislation which allowed the National Security agency to undertake the collection of telephone data of American citizens. A new piece of legislation which allows the continued monitoring of lone wolf suspects and roving wiretaps is still being discussed. President Obama has warned the failure to renew the surveillance means the United States is less able to track potential terrorist threats. Our North America Editorjon Sopel is in Washington and has more details. Three important parts of the old Patriot act that was brought in after 9/11 can no longer be used. With no new legislation to replace it yet, it means computer boffins in the NSA and CIA and FBI have been turning off servers. The US government is no longer able to bulk collect telephone data which they say has been a vital instrument in the fight against terror. There are no longer able to have these mobile wiretaps where they think terror suspects keep changing their phones and they will not be able to go after Lone Wolf operators. People who they suspect want to carry out attacks but are not part of a group. This is because senators last night failed to extend the Patriot Act. It is likely a new piece of legislation will come in in the next few days. In the meantime, there is a hiatus. President Obama has warned that this could affect the way it terror suspects are found out. He has made a statement, calling on the Senate to ensure this irresponsible lapse is as short lived as possible. They want is reversed and they want new legislation. The FBI and CIA have also come out and said this. It is worth underlining one other parts of this. The person who has driven this is a Republican senator called Rand Paul. He has been roundly criticised by the two previous people who have run for the Republican presidency, john McCain accusing him of jeopardising national security of in pursuit of his presidential ambitions and Mitt Romney sang commonsense must trump conspiracy. A real direct poke in the eye to the senator who has brought this about. How are American citizens reacting? They will react with some disbelief. Many people will think, although we do not like this mass collection of data, if it keeps us safe, that is what should be priority. On the other hand, Rand Paul is running for president. He is running to be a different kind of president. He is attracting support from groups of people who want to focus on civil liberties and were shocked by what they heard. They will be attracted to what he is offering and what he has done. The US Defence Secretary has voiced concern about Britain’s defence spending cuts. Speaking to the BBC, Ashton Carter said there was a risk that the United Kingdom will become disengaged if it cuts its military budget any further. His intervention comes as the newly elected Conservative majority government of David Cameron plans one billion pounds in cuts that are likely to take the country’s defence budget to less than the 2% of the total size of the economy. That’s the Nato target for defence spending. He was speaking to my colleague Katty Kay in Vietnam. The new British government has already announced cuts to its defence budget. It looks like it is inevitable that Britain’s defence spending will come below 2% of GDP. What is your message to your colleagues in London? My message to mY colleagues in London? My message to my colleagues in London and all the other capitals in Nato is to stick to the pledge they all made, which was if they were below 2% to achieve 2%. Britain has always had an independent ability to express itself and punched above its weight. I hope to see that not go away. It is a great loss to the world when a country with that much history and standing extractions which seemed to indicate disengagement. And you can see more of that exclusive interview with the US Defence Secretary Ash Carter throughout the day here on BBC News. Early projections from local elections in Italy indicate that the Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, has not received the strong endorsement he wanted in order to push ahead with labour, education, and constitutional reforms. His centre-left Democratic Party looks set to clinch several regional governorships but there were strong performances by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing Northern League. The US Secretary of State john Kerry is being treated overnight in a hospital in Geneva after breaking his leg cycling in the French Alps. He’s planning to leave Switzerland shortly and return to the United States for further treatment. The State Department says Mr Kerry had broken a part of his right leg, but did not lose consciousness. Pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong have met Chinese officials in a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences over electoral reform in the territory. Beijing plans to introduce direct elections, but only with a restricted list of candidates. Legislators left the meeting promising to continue to fight the proposals which led to led to the umbrella street protests last year. Time to talk to Sally and find out what is happening in the world of business. I know you are looking at Malaysia our lines. This has been a belief that company. -- Malaysia airlines. Many focused on structure. Leaner and meaner, but will it fly? That is the big question. Malaysia Airlines is expected to announce plans to re-brand and down-size today. The state owned carrier is attempting to shake off a long history of mismanagement and government interference. It comes after years of successive losses, and the twin disasters of MH370 and MH17. Thousands ofjob cuts are expected to be confirmed, together with a downsizing of its fleet. Navigating the way through these turbulent times is new chief executive, Christoph Mueller, who took the helm in May. When you look at his history, he has turned around several airlines in the past. Can he pull it off? We will be having that discussion later. It’s another crucial week for Greece. On Friday it must pay the International Monetary Fund at least a quarter of the 1.5 billion euros it has to pay this month. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the money it owes. This month the total Greece actually needs to pay in terms of bills is 6.7 billion euros. As already mentioned 1.5 billion of that is to the IMF. The rest, 5.2 billion is short term treasury bills. The assumption is these will be rolled over- if not that would be a big disaster and there are more payments to come in july and August. It has to pay at least another ten billion euros to the IMF, the ECB and short term bills. Meanwhile, talks are still continuing in Brussels on whether the European Union, along with IMF, can release further bailout funds. The stumbling block is the Europeans don’t want to give Athens more money unless it meets various austerity targets. China has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world, with more than 300 million smokers. But from Monday smokers in Beijing are banned from lighting-up in public places. Break the law and they could receive a fine of up to 200 yuan, that’s the equivalent of $30. Still, as our correspondent Martin Patience reports from Beijing, this isn’t the first time the capital has tried to kick the habit. China, a smoker’s paradise, a country that consumes a third of the world’s cigarettes. More than half the men smoke here but at what cost? A million people die a year from smoking related illnesses. Now Beijing says it wants to quit for good. The capital is banning smoking in public places, including at restaurants like this one. The thing is, there have been smoking bans before but they haven’t worked and what is surprising about China is the way that people just break the rules. If they want a cigarette, theyjust pull one out, light one up and smoke away, but authorities say that this time around things are going to be different, and if you do smoke in a public place, you will face a heavy fine. TRANSLATION: I think the ban would be hard to enforce in China. There are simply too many smokers. TRANSLATION: If you really want to ban smoking, you should shut down the cigarette factories. If they ban smoking then I’m not coming to Beijing. TRANSLATION: Smoking in public places harms everyone. I think the ban can work, but everyone needs to be on board. Smoking was once common amongst China’s leaders. Chairman Mao and his successor were rarely seen without a cigarette in hand. But the current president, Xi jinping, has bucked the trend. He has quit and that is because the government finally realises the cost of smoking, say antitobacco campaigners. TRANSLATION: Tobacco taxes are a huge source of revenue for the government. The costs of treating smoking-related illnesses are now higher. The President talks about the Chinese dream but he says that, first of all, you must be healthy. If you smoke and fall sick, there will be no Chinese dream. But talking about quitting and actually doing it are two different things. And China is bound to suffer nicotine withdrawals during the process. Human rights activists are accusing the Iraqi authorities of preventing thousands of civilians from Anbar province of reaching safer parts of the country. They fled their homes after the Islamic State took control of the area from the Iraqi government. That same Shia led government has imposed tight security restrictions on entering Baghdad. It means that many Sunni families are stranded in a tent city near the banks of the Euphrates river. Food and other supplies are running short which has forced some to return to Anbar province despite ongoing fighting. Meanwhile, a key architect of US strategy in Iraq has told the BBC that IS is a formidable enemy, but can be beaten. David Petraeus, a retired US four-star general and former CIA director, warned that a political, as well as military solution, was needed to defeat the militant group. I think when you sustain a reverse or significant setbacks like the loss of Ramadi, which was notjust an operational loss, the loss of the Anbar operational command headquarters as well, but a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative, the reality of Islamic State being on the defensive, of losing, was shown to be somewhat hollow as well. Ido think, actually, Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks, if not shorter, but this was a big setback. Stay with us on BBC News, still to come. We’ll take you to the Kurdish east of Turkey where emotions are running high ahead of the weekend’s elections. Now a look at some of the UK news. The government is to double free childcare for working parents in parts of England, a year earlier than planned. Pilots for the scheme offering 30 hours of care for 3-1+-year-olds will now begin in September next year. A charity representing many day-care providers has warned the scheme is already severely underfunded. Up to 100,000 people who employ personal carers are being warned they may now be legally liable to pay them pension contributions. From today, small businesses employing up to 30 people will gradually be obliged to offer them pensions under the auto-enrolment programme. The Pensions Regulator says those who don’t comply could receive a £1+00 fine. A Royal Marine recruit on the verge of completing his training has collapsed and died while on exercise on Dartmoor. The man, who’s not been named, was taking part in the 30 miler, which is the last major test for new Marines. The Ministry of Defence is investigating what caused his death. This is BBC World News. I’m Naga Munchetty. The latest headlines: The Senate in Washington has failed to stop the expiry of legislation that allows the National Security Agency to gather telephone call records. The White House called the failure irresponsible. Senators will debate a compromise bill this week. The US Defence Secretary has voiced concern about Britain’s defence spending cuts. Speaking to the BBC, Ashton Carter said there was a risk that the United Kingdom will become disengaged if it cuts its military budget any further. It’s the final week of campaigning before Turkey’s general election on Sunday. And the votes of the country’s 15 million Kurds seem to be more important than ever before. If their HDP party can cross the threshold and make into parliament for the first time, the governing AK Party could well be denied the majority, which would help them consolidate their grip on power. Our correspondent, Mark Lowen, is travelling across the country in the run up to the poll. He’s now reached Diyarbakir where the Kurds are mourning the loss of their fighters in Syria and Iraq. For decades, the Kurds have been dying fighting for their national cause and still it goes on. We are at the funeral of a 26-year-old who went off to fight with Kurdish militia in northern Syria against so-called Islamic State and was killed. Now hundreds have gathered here in her hometown, Diyarbakir, to attend her funeral. The slogans have rung out, long live the resistance, the martyrs never die. As Kurdish soldiers have died in Syria and Iraq, it has re-energised their community here in Turkey, revived their sense of a Kurdish struggle for a Kurdish identity and that is what they are fighting for in this election, because their political party, the HDP, is on the brink of entering parliament, crossing the 10% threshold to get into the Turkish parliament for the first time. It would have been inconceivable ten years ago for a Kurdish party to hope to be elected to the Turkish parliament. There is a sense they have already won. Now they are desperate to get into parliament to represent the Kurds on the national stage. And you can follow Mark and his team on their trip across Turkey.

A group of elderly Ugandan women made headlines in April when they stripped before government ministers in a protest over land rights. The women say the government plans to evict them as well as thousands of others from their ancestral lands, Acholi - a claim the authorities deny. It’s one example of the many disputes over land that have emerged in northern Uganda since the end of the Lord’s Resistance Army civil war. Catherine Byaruhanga reports from Amuru. This is a rare sight. But for the Acholi people of northern Uganda, a woman stripping in public visits the worst of curses on her enemy. On this day, two ministers arrived in the village with government survey is to demarcate the land where these people live. They believe the authorities want to evict them and make way for foreign investors -- surveyors. The communityjoined surveyors. The community joined forces surveyors. The communityjoined forces and, led by the women, made the officials turned back. I met two of the ladies who stripped, they are furious, not only because of the possible evictions, but also for what they say are abuses by the security forces, which led to their sons’ death. TRANSLATION: I undressed because I am hurting. My son was killed. Now they have come back to send us away from our land yet this is my grandfather ‘s land. I had 15 goats. Now eight out of 15 have been killed and right now I have nothing. I am without anything. Many Acholi people move the government camps during the 18 year insurgency waged either Lord’s Resistance Army, the LRA. When they came back, some faced questions about whether they owned the land they say has always been there as -- by the. The community of this village is scattered around in compounds like this one. The residents say about 21,000 people would be affected by any evictions. They say that this is their ancestral land, but the Uganda wildlife authority is adamant that it is a game reserve and they should leave. The Uganda wildlife authority doesn’t deny that security officials used violence against the residents, which led to this woman 's son being shot. The communities had already been poisoned, OK? With a lot of negative publicity. And it wasn’t easy that we could actually go unprotected. It was notjust for killing people, it was for self safety. The government say they will go ahead with plans that could see these women moved off the land. But they are offering compensation or resettlement for anyone affected. The wildlife authority ‘s plans are subject to a legal challenge in the Ugandan High Court, but the women of this village are adamant they will do whatever it takes to protect land rights, even if that means stripping again. Now a look at the sport news. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has hailed Alberto Contador as ""one of the greatest cyclists of all time"" after the Spaniard won the Giro d’Italia on Sunday, the seventh Grand Tour victory of his career. The Tinko-Saxoff rider retained the leaders pinkjersey for the last stage over 178km from Turin to Milan, to keep himself on course to become the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 to win both the Giro and the Tour de France in the same year. Italy’s Fabio Aru finished second and his Astana team-mate Mikel Landa of Spain was third overall. It’s been a rain delayed Day 8 at Rolland Garros, for the French Open in Paris. 2009 champion Roger Federer got broken by local favourite Gael Monfils to even their fourth-round match at a set apiece right before play was suspended until Monday. Earlier, Elina Svitolina progressed to the last eight, while Flavia Pennetta and Garbine Muguruza’s match was also postponed until Monday. Elsewhere, another Frenchman, jo-Wilifried Tsonga came through a tough four-set match against Thomas Berdych to book a quarter-final encounter with Kei Nishikori. He isa He is a very good player, he is younger than me. He is a very good player, he is youngerthan me. He younger than me. He has got a lot of talent. He is able to do many things on court. And I have had problems playing against him in the past. So, for me, it’s gonna be an opportunity to take revenge and try to play my best tennis and try to reach the semis. Yeah, Ithink, to come into the quarter-final is my first goal for these two weeks. And I knew that I could do this because I was doing well this clay-court season at the start of last year. And I hope it is the start of my... Myjourney. I hope I can keep going and this is the first time to be in the quarter-final of the French Open, so it means a lot for me. Nishikori booked his place in he last eight with a straight sets win over Teymuraz Gabashvili. Stanilas Warwinka beat Gilles Simon, while defending women’s champion Maria Sharapova’s match against Lucie Safarova again was postponed until Monday due to weather.

Police in Scotland are to investigate the scenes which marred the end of Motherwell’s Premiership play-off win against Rangers at Fir Park - a match which the home side won 3-0 to preserve their top-flight status and condemn Rangers to another season in the Championship. Rangers defender Bilel Mohsni was pushed in the back by Lee Erwin apparently for refusing a handshake. The Tunisian responded by kicking and punching the Motherwell striker, which sparked a scuffle on the pitch, also involving Fraser Kerr for the home side. All three players were sent-off. Soren Kjeldsen has won the Irish Open at Royal County Down by claiming victory on the first play off hole. The Dane, who’s ranked 303 in the world, birdied the par five 18th in a three way tussle involving Austria’s Bernd Wiesberger and England’s Eddie Pepperell after they all finished regulation play tied on 2-under.

He finished with a final round of 61+ to record an 18 under par total, four shots clear of the field. It was his second ever victory on the PGA Tour and he is the third Australian to win this event in eight years. That’s it from me. You can get much more later. Now for a look at the weather.. Hello. Conditions slow to improve on Sunday across southern and eastern parts of the country. Elsewhere we saw a mixture of sunshine and showers, they will continue on through the overnight period across northern and western areas primarily, winterness over the high ground of Scotland. Would you believe it? Even though we’re into the first of june. A chilly night to come for many places, central, and eastern places seeing fewer showers and starting off on a dry note. It will be a chilly start, some sunshine around for many central and £8StEIâI’I BFEBS. Showers across southwest England, Wales, the Midlands, some could be on the heavy side for a while through the morning. A few showers as well pushing in towards northern England, particularly northwest. Showers to start the day in Scotland and Ireland, some of them heavy across central and western parts of Scotland, winds increasing at this point in the morning as well. The trend is for it to go downhill through the day, a weather system pushing in off the Atlantic will bring wet and windy weather to WESlEI’I’I BFEBS BS ti’IE day pI’OgI’ESSES. Heavy persistent rain developing here. The south-east is holding onto the drier weather for longest, but even here it will get cloudier through the afternoon, 16 degrees at best, also, 11-13. A dry start for the cricket at Headingley, thickening cloud and increasing wind through the afternoon with rain arriving. Very wet and windy with gales on Monday evening across the country. Gales could touch 60, maybe 70 mph for a time during Monday night. It will be with us on Tuesday, quite a wild day. Outbreaks of rain across southern England, some heavy rain across Scotland, strong winds wherever you are, making you feel cool for the time of year for the second ofjune, 11-16 Celsius at best. We will see an area of high pressure beginning to move up from the south to settle things down on Wednesday. Wednesday will be breezy. A little bit of cloud and rain across the north and east of Scotland. It will clean away and things will be quieter for Wednesday afternoon. Maybe 20 Celsius in the south-east. The weekend will be wet and windy to start, cool as well. Turning drier and warmer. This is BBC World News, the headlines. The White House has called members of the US Senate irresponsible for failing to prevent the expiry of counter-terrorism legislation. Senators have now agreed to debate a Bill to introduce more closely targeted security measures. The US Defence Secretary has voiced concern about Britain’s planned defence spending cuts. Speaking to the BBC, Ashton Carter said there is a risk of the United Kingdom becoming disengaged if it cuts its military budget any further. Early projections from local elections in Italy indicate that the Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, did not receive the strong endorsement he wanted in order to push ahead with labour, education, and constitutional reforms. The daughter of FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told the BBC that her father is the victim of a conspiracy from behind the scenes. Mr Blatter, who was re-elected as head of world football last week, faces calls to stand down. Those are the latest headlines from BBC World News. Now for the latest financial news with Sally and World Business Report. How much can you cut without clipping the wings? Malaysia Airlines will reveal a radical restructuring to end up with a leaner and more efficient business. And, it’s time again - another big debt payment is looming for Greece. How long can it honour its obligations, before the coffers run dry? Welcome to World Business Report. I’m Sally Bundock - also in the programme Asia’s number 1 and 2 economies are showing signs of strength - we’ll have the latest news out of China and japan. Leaner and meaner, but will it fly? Malaysia Airlines is expected to announce plans to re-brand and down-size today. The state owned carrier is attempting to shake off a long history of mismanagement and government interference, and its severely damaged brand after last year’s two plane disasters. For more we’re joined by Rico Hizon in the Singapore newsroom. So Rico what is the plan? The plan is for thousands ofjob cuts to be cut. That is about 6000, a third of the workforce. Together with the downsizing of its major fleet. It comes after years of successive losses and those twin disasters in 2011+. Navigating through this turbulent time is the new chief executive, Christoph Mueller. He is known for restructuring carriers and spearheaded the revamp at Lufthansa. I spoke with an outline analyst who stressed the new CEO will encounter many problems in overhauling the operations. It might be very similar, but not the same. It will have similar issues, but the issues like the union bargaining power will be very different. It will take some time, depending on how he wants to split the problems into pieces. The majority stakeholder of Malaysia Airlines Harvey sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia. They took Malaysia our lines private last year in the wake of the disasters. -- Malaysia Airlines. They want to see the carrier profitable by the end of 2017 and they want to relist the carrier on the stock exchange. It’s another crucial week for Greece. On Friday it must pay the International Monetary Fund at least a quarter of the 1.5 billion it has to pay this month. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the money it owes. This month the total Greece actually needs to pay in terms of bills is 6.7 billion euros. As already mentioned 1.5 billion of that is to the IMF. The rest, 5.2 billion, is short term treasury bills. The assumption is these will be rolled over- if not that would be a big disaster and there are more payments to come in july and August. It has to pay at least another ten billion euros to the IMF, the ECB and short term bills. Meanwhile talks are still continuing in Brussels on whether the European Union, along with IMF, can release further bailout funds. The stumbling block is the Europeans don’t want to give Athens more money unless it meets various austerity targets. We’ll get an expert view in a moment but first Anna Holligan reports from Athens on how desperate the situation is becoming. Billy is going to collect his lunch. He isjust one of Greece’s 1.2 million unemployed. He relies on free handouts from the banks. At this one, funded by the church, they serve 200 families per day, up from 60 since the start of the crisis. According to the consumers Institute, about 2 million Greeks are now living below the poverty line. This man is a proud pensioner. Afraid he will not receive his monthly payment of 1000 euros. TRANSLATION: Sometimes I want to take my family outjust to have coffee. And it hurts me. I worked my entire life for this money, sol can’t believe I have to think twice about spending it. The government was elected on a promise to end austerity. But negotiations with its creditors have failed to unlock the Merrion in 7.2 million euros of bailout funds. -- the remaining 7.2 million euros. Some powers in the economy are doing relatively well, despite the crisis. There are fears over what a deal with Europe would mean. On this island, the mood is nervous. These islands thrive on tourism. Talk of a possible hike in tax rates, many are anxious that could make them less competitive, forcing their prices up and the tourists out. Now they are supporting an increasing number of migrants, coming across the Aegean Sea. The tension is rising. These people take the money away from me. I do not have money to feed my kids. And police feed them from my taxes. I cannot feed my grandchildren. Somebody has to do something. Because enough is enough. Summer is usually a time of optimism here. The tourism industry employs one in five Greeks. The longer it takes to reach a deal, the greater the fear that Greece might do under. With me is Eleni Papoula, Greece Analyst at Berenberg bank. Thank you for being on the programme. You are from Greece, your family still lives there. You have just come back. The banking sector is your area of speciality. We were hearing from the piece how difficult things are. Banks are on the brink, aren’t they? Thank you for having me on the show. I did come back from Greece. My biggest concern is from the trip were the liquidity crunch. That is creating capital flight that is creating a funding risk for the banks. Based on my discussions and interests, a deal is expected to be struck eminently between the government and the international creditors regarding sustainability and debt. And if that deal is struck, perhaps the situation can be reversed. But since presidential elections in December 2011+, the banks have lost 30 billion in deposits. There have been shut out of the wholesale debt market. As a result, since then they have been reliant on ECB funding. This situation is not sustainable. Eventually the banks will have to PGY Eventually the banks will have to pay back. It sits at 113 billion, including emergency liquidity assistance. This can only be done once. They believe when the new government came in that debt would be written off. That has not happened. Exactly. Based on my discussions, one of the issues they are facing in the first quarter is a number of borrowers, mortgage owners, medium enterprises, have stopped servicing their debt. That is in anticipation of the government writing it off. That has not happened. The creek banks need to take additional losses, which jeopardises their profitability. They would expect it will be a difficult year. Thank you so much for coming in. Interesting to get the perspective of how it is going underground. We will keep you up-to-date on how the week progresses. You canjoin progresses. You can join them Thompson and myself for business life at 830. We will be joined by the Nobel laureate. We will talk to a lot of issues. That is a with interesting interview. join us in the UK at 830 BST. We have had good news out of China and japan. Economic news in japan, capital expenditure in companies, corporate pace is very encouraging. And in China, manufacturing reports show a good month in the month of May. Good stories boosting sentiment in Asia. That is all from World Business Report. I will see you shortly. A trial to double free childcare for working parents in parts of England is to be brought in a year earlier than planned. Pilots for the scheme offering thirty hours of care for three and four-year-olds will now begin in September next year. But care providers warn that the scheme is already severely underfunded. Here’s our education correspondent, Gillian Hargreaves. What dog is this? Like most preschools, this one provides 15 hours free child care a week for three and four -year-olds, paid for by the government. Nurseries at say thatis by the government. Nurseries at say that is not enough. They think it meets only 50% of the true cost. To make ends meet, many rely on parents paving make ends meet, many rely on parents paying for hours not included in the scheme. From 2016, the government plans to increase free childcare for three and four -year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours each week. Nurseries say they will be out of pocket by £250 million per year, which works out to £661 per child, if the scheme is funded at current levels. It is estimated 600,000 families will benefit from the extra hours. If the funding does not come forward, this is crunch time. There will be a meltdown. We will see more people withdraw from the system. That will just people withdraw from the system. That willjust derail the entire policy. It would have been better to consult the sector. Most parents will welcome more free childcare. The doubts over funding might mean they have less choice and they might have to pay more if nurseries withdraw their support. However, the government says it will increase the funding to childcare providers in a review this summer. It also points out the extra three hours from other measures will help cut childcare bills by as much as £500,000 per year for families. bills by as much as £500,000 per yearforfamilies. -- £5,000 per year. I’m Naga Munchetty. The top stories this hour. The White House has called members of the US Senate irresponsible for failing to prevent the expiry of counter-terrorism legislation.

The American Defence Secretary has voiced concern over Britain’s plan to defence cuts. He says there is a risk the United Kingdom could become disengaged. Early projections from local elections in Italy indicate the Prime Minister has not received the strong endorsement he wanted in order to push ahead with labour, education and constitutional reforms.

The daughter of FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told the BBC that her father is the victim of a conspiracy from behind the scenes. Mr Blatter, who was re-elected to his post last week, has not been implicated in an ongoing corruption investigation by the American authorities - but faces calls to stand down. Now it’s time for our newspaper review. What’s making headlines around the world? The Business section of the Independent is leading on Greek bailout talks. The debt-laden nation needs to pay back $330 million in loans on Friday, but according to this report, talks with creditors are getting nowhere. British Prime Minister David Cameron is rallying support from European leaders to give Britain exemption from the European Union. So far, two senior politicians have sketched deals and are urging others to follow suit. The Financial Times reports that six of Europe’s biggest oil and gas companies, including Shell and BP, have asked the United Nations to help them devise a plan to reduce their carbon emissions. The top story on China Daily is Beijing’s new smoking ban. The Chinese capital is butting out smoking in all indoor public places. In the FT Companies and Markets lift out, reports that General Motors is trying to avoid a future backlash over vehicle defects by detecting problems early. They’ve hired 1,000 people to scour social media to pick up potential issues, before even ten people are affected. If you’re travelling this season, North Korea has recently lifted its six month ban over fears of the spread of Ebola. The japan Times reports the North hopes tourism will increase ten fold -- The japan Times reports the North hopes tourism will increase tenfold in the next two years. And trending on Twitter at the moment, the hash tag ""love-locks"". The Independent has tweeted ""Is this the end of romance? "" Paris love locks removed from the iconic Pont des Arts bridge."" joining us now is CEO Mentor, David CM Carter. You mentor chief executives? Yes, I do. Only those, no one else. As you will be interested to get your interest on how Greece is panning out. We have talked about it before and we will talk about it again, there is deadlock with international creditors according to the independent Macon Blair is no stage is for the paper. independent Macon Blair is no stage is forthe paper. How is for the paper. How do you think they are dealing with this issue -- independent Mac. The Greek government? This is the classic who will blink first, whether European funders of Greece numbers don’t stack up the way the Greek government are telling its population they want it... The way they want to run the economy. And so, we have situations where the retirement age in Greece is 50. So, pension costs for the country are not sustainable competitive rest of Europe. The rest of Europe is lending them money and saving this isn’t realistic or sustainable. When you look at the new leadership, the Prime Minister of Greece, the finance minister of Greece, how do you feel they are handling the negotiations, which they knew from the outset would be very tough, given the rhetoric coming from the finance minister of Germany’s. just because they won the election in Greece promising to end austerity, doesn’t mean they will be able to do so -- Germany. Their ability to do so is a function of variability to persuade people around the world to lend them a lot of money. Without making those reforms, the rest of the world will see they are pouring good money after bad and that the situation is not sustainable or realistic. So, if he is promising his electorate the world and he cannot deliver, perhaps he won’t be the leader for long. Interesting, talking about how they have approached this, jose Manuel Barroso, former president of the European Commission says sometimes it seems like people are waiting for an accident so they can avoid a bigger disaster. It has taken too long to find a solution. It is important now. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, jack Lew, talking about a catastrophic accident that could have implications. The Independent now. This was a chelation point ahead of the general election for the Conservatives, that Britain would take a look at its relationship with the EU and whether or not we should have the same ties the rest of Europe has. And now it appears there are deals being done. Tell us what the paper is saying. I think the election promise for Mr Kapron to renegotiate Britain ‘s role in Europe was very clear-- Cameron. I think the treaty that was set down over 20 years ago, a lot of people around Europe are saying, perhaps this and this doesn’t work. And I think that he has the support of the French Economy Minister Macron and president of the European parliament, Martin Shultz, who said perhaps these ideas that Britain is putting forward are unrealistic and perhaps there are other countries in the EU who would welcome a discussion about these things. Sol don’t think that actually it is unreasonable to say that after 20 years, let’s it down and talk about how the rules work for everyone because some of them are great and some of them are not working. I am confident that David Cameron can renegotiate some changes in the way the European Union and Britain interact, which would be positive for the whole of Europe, notjust Britain. Moving on to energy and this is the Financial Times’ front Pa9âÂ this is the Financial Times’ front page, European energy groups seek UN backing for carbon pricing system. This is in the run-up to a Paris meeting, it at the UN, sealing an international climate deal. What are these companies doing in the run-up to get their ducks in a row? Interesting, the Europeans seem to have got their act together as a group, but the two major US oil companies don’t want to be involved. I think, at the end of the day, this is long-term planning. The oil companies in Europe are saying we know at some point in the next hundred years the oil and gas is going to run out. We have to think about how we are going to replace that fuel with alternative sources, and perhaps the revenue we are paving and perhaps the revenue we are paying in tax, the cash we are paving paying in tax, the cash we are paying in tax could be used to fund research and development. Let’s have a long-term solution to this problem, which we start funding through perhaps... You need Americans on board as well, ultimately, don’t you? Eventually, of course, yes. The China Daily, tough Knowsley tingles. All very well saying they are tough in Beijing. -- well saying they are tough in Beijing.-- path Beijing. -- path anti-smoking rules. What makes this time any different? I don’t know if it will be different -- tough. Often, we look at something like this in terms of China being socially concerned about the health of its population, but actually what they have figured out is that the cost of dealing with healthcare issues in China on smoking is significantly greater than the tax that they receive. So, whereas for the last. .. than the tax that they receive. So, whereas for the last... You say it’s just about money? It’s just about money. You’re so cynical! Perhaps realistic as well. Pressure from authorities and if you look at the rest of the world... 300 million people in China smoke. That’s out of a population of... 50% of all men in China smoke. The tax revenues they have had have been significant. Now they have woken to the fact the cost of dealing with it is more than the tax revenues, there is a financial decision. It is a no-brainer. Fancy a holiday? North Korea. What you think, are you keen to... Travel around North Korea, check it out? It is not my bucket list, I have to say. Amazing, interesting idea, going to North Korea on holiday. I think they have about 100,000 people a year visit the country, 90% of whom come from China. Surprising to hear, isn’t it? You wouldn’t expect that, necessarily. Iwonder hear, isn’t it? You wouldn’t expect that, necessarily. I wonder if they are really tourists or people going to find out what’s going on in North Korea. I wonder if it is a covert Spving Korea. I wonder if it is a covert spying operation. These conspiracy theories coming out. There is a luxury ski resort that has been opened. Restaurants along the beach area. The biggest attraction they are talking about is a shooting range. You shoot holograms. Not necessarily my first choice of holiday, but I wouldn’t knock it off the list. Interesting, wouldn’t it? David, thank you. Sally and I will see you very soon. Do have a lovely day. Goodbye. Over the next few days we have got some very wet and windy weather in the forecast, but before we reach that point I will recap the weather on Sunday. We saw a band of rain and wind sweep across the country, eventually clearing eastwards to leave a mixture of showers with some spells of sunshine. Through the overnight period we will continue to see showers across northern and western areas, some of them wintry over the Scottish mountains, and it will be breezy. Central and eastern areas seeing fewer showers and chilly spots in rural places. A little less cold, though, across southwestern areas. We start the first ofjune on a bright note but quite chilly BCFOSS CEI’IlIâ8l and £8StEIâI’I BFEBS. Showers around south-west England, into Wales and the Midlands and some of them could be on the heavy side with winds beginning to pick up at this point of the morning. Showers across northern England too and a showery start across Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some sun in between. We could start to see more persistent rain pushing in towards Northern Ireland by this point. Through the day, we see this deep area of low pressure start to push in from the west and it will cause many areas to turn wetter and windier with clouds gathering across southern and eastern areas with some shower and rain developing. Definitely turning down hill as the afternoon moves on. 15-16 in the south-east after that bright start, 11-12 elsewhere. For the cricket at Headingly, it will be a dry start with the cloud thickening and outbreaks of rain beginning to push in from the west as the afternoon wears on. It is this unseasonably deep area of low pressure which will cause winds up to 60-70 mph in some places, and we could see some disruption from this as it moves through. It will still be with us on Tuesday, bringing very strong winds and this band of rain is slow to clear from southern and eastern areas. Heavy rain across Scotland and feeling cool in other areas. 18 or 19 across the south-east corner. Another pretty wild day on Tuesday but by Wednesday this area of low pressure moves out of the way. This area of high pressure moves in from the south to settle things down. Wednesday is a better looking day although there will still be a breeze across northern and eastern areas but it will die down as the day goes on. Elsewhere it will turn drier with warm spells of sunshine. Temperatures, 13 to 19, maybe 20 degrees in the south-east. So to recap the new working week, we will start off wet and windy and midweek it will start to turn drier and slowly, by the end of the week, it will get a little bit warmer too. Hello this is Breakfast, with Louise Minchin and Bill Turnbull. Plans to double the amount of free childcare for working parents will be introduced earlier than planned. The new scheme will begin in England next year but care providers warn the nursery system faces meltdown if it’s not properly funded. Good morning, it’s Monday the first ofjune. Also this morning: A British-led trial of two cancer drugs suggests that, used together, they can shrink tumours in more than half of people with the most serious form of skin cancer.

On BBC London; the number of people killed in fires in London halves in five years - the Fire Brigades Union argues the figure isn’t accurate. We also hear about a little-known form of child abuse. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Melanoma or skin cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the UK, killing more than 2000 people every year. But now doctors say they’ve seen ""spectacular"" results after using two drugs in combination. In trials of the procedure, nearly two-thirds of people with this most serious form of skin cancer saw the tumours shrink, as our Medical Correspondent, Fergus Walsh, now tells us. When Vicky Brown from Cardiff was diagnosed with advanced melanoma two years ago, she thought she might have just months to live. But a combination of two therapy drugs cleared tumours from her breast and lung. Her passion is travel. She’s just returned from holiday in Florida. Ifeel just returned from holiday in Florida. I feel extremely fortunate they was in the right time at the right place to be offered this trial. It’s given me two more years of my granddaughter and I’ve managed to travel, I’vejust of my granddaughter and I’ve managed to travel, I’ve just come back from a week with some friends in Tampa. Vicky is part of an international trial led by the Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research. The drug combination stopped cancer progressing for a yearin stopped cancer progressing for a year in nearly 60% of patients. What is different about the drugs Vicky was given is that they don’t kill cancerous tissue themselves but rather enable our immune system to do so. Within our bodies, is an army of cells designed to destroy any organism which poses a threat. But they spare healthy tissue. Cancer cells which are corrupted copies of normal human tissue can sometimes be difficult for our killer cells to identify and in some cases they inhibit the immune response through a chemical hand shake on the cell surface. The new drugs block the hand shake so the killer cells see the cancer for what it is, the immune system is reprogrammed to destroy the cancer. This is a time of dramatic development in cancer treatment. Immuno-therapy will be a key part of a new era of smarter, more targeted drugs. 1+0 years ago one in four survived, now it’s one in two. With the new treatments coming on with the more research we are doing, we are getting faster and faster and it’s our hope that in 20 years’ time, three in four will survive and the immunotherapy treatments will be part of that puzzle. Vicky Brown will soon need more immunotherapy to clear another due more on her lung, so it’s far too early to talk about curing cancer. Nonetheless, the treatments are among the most exciting developments in cancer therapy for years. And Fergus is with me. An exciting breakthrough; what does it mean for the treatment of cancer overall? It’s an unprecedented time of progress in Cancer Research. The fruits are the greater understanding of the genetics, the blog of cancer and what drives it. What is exciting about immunotherapy is allowing the body itself to unmask the cancer cells that hide in the body and then attack them -- cells that hide in the body and then attack them -- biology. It’s an entirely new approach. What is exciting about it is, it’s notjust working in melanoma, there have been a whole raft of studies which show promise against lung cancer, the biggest Kell killer, head and neck and live cancer, so it could be used against a whole range of cancers. There is a big but here, it’s expensive. One of the two drugs that you saw in that report there that Vicky Brown was on costs ÂIoo,000 a patient. The other will be tens of thousands of pounds. Only this morning, NICE, the health watchdog, has rejected a targeted therapy which took 20 years to develop in Britain for women who have a particular genetic mutation who have ovarian cancer. They have rejected it because it costs £1+,000 a month, they say they can’t see enough benefit from it. This is something that society is going to have to grapple with. There are dozens of these cancer therapies. We’ll have to make a choice between how much this is worth extending the lives of patients against all the other pressures facing the NHS. Trials of a scheme to double the amount of free childcare for three and four-year-olds in England are to start a year earlier than planned. The Government says it’s the ""right thing to do for working families"". But one charity has warned of ""meltdown"" unless the Government increases the amount of money it pays to childcare providers. Here’s our Education Correspondent, Gillian Hargreaves. Like most preschool, kids nurseries provide 15 hours of free childcare each week for three and four-year-olds, paid for by the Government. However, nurseries say the money they receive isn’t enough. They warn that plans to extend free childcare could put some out of business and others mite opt out of the scheme all together. From 2016, the Government plans to increase free childcare for three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours each week for working parents. Nurseries say they could be out-of- pocket by £250 Nurseries say they could be out-of-pocket by £250 million out-of- pocket by £250 million a year, which works out at £661 per child if the extended scheme is funded at current levels. It’s estimated more than 600,000 families will benefit. At kids Cabin they receive £3.75 an hour from the Government for each free place but it costs more like £6. 50 an hour so they make up the short fall by charging parents who ‘re not entitled to free places at market rate. They have fed parents this amazing idea that here is your free childcare, you are entitled to it, they’ll give it to you, but it’s not free, we are subsidising it. The Government’s promised there will be more money, but they’ve got to balance the books. We are committed to increasing the funding and, of course, for us, it’s about making sure we find the right level of funding. Working with providers and making sure that there is fairness for the providers and also value for the taxpayers as well. Of course, most parents will welcome more free childcare, but doubts over funding might mean they have less choice and they may have to pay more if nurseries withdraw their support. Which is why even mums who will benefit have reservations. I think it’s great news for parents that we are going to get this, especially for myself, we have a second child who we’ll send to the nursery soon. Taking a look at the wider picture, we don’t want the nursery to go out of business. Helping working parents is a priority for this Government, but generous pledges without solid investment and the backing of nurseries could leave extended free childcare out in the cold. Let’sjoin Norman Smith our Assistant Political Editor in Westminster. Why is the Government accelerating introducing this scheme given all the criticism? You are right, Mr Cameron’s put his foot on the gas because it’s now being rolled out a year early. It will start next September, despite all the snags about whether there’s enough cash for it and snags about whether childcare providers can offer this additional provision, snags over whether it will encourage women to go back to work and a big snag as to whether the Government should be helping families earning up to £150,000 a year childcare. The reason he’s gone for it I think is because it’s one of the big stand out give-aways of the general election, one Mr Cameron deliberately sought to trump Labour and the Liberal Democrats on. He knows with the dark clouds of deficit reduction gathering, with a bruising budget next month, he wants some better news to put in front of people. There’s a second reason and it is this, he wants this to be a Government for working people. What is perhaps the biggest cost or one of the biggest costs facing working people after housing costs, front costs, it’s childcare, hence Mr Cameron’s decision to accelerate the introduction of this policy. In the last hour or so, we have had a statement from Downing Street on its plans for child benefit. What can you tell us about that? Yes, Number Ten’s sought to dampen down the idea there are going to be cuts to child benefit. There’s been a lot of rumours about the possibility and a clear desire at Number Ten not to be seen with giving with one hand, taking with another, so instead we are being told no cuts for two years, but I would be cautious in thinking that means child benefit will not be touched because we know the Government’s got to save still around £10 billion from the welfare budget in the next two years and if you are looking for areas to make savings, child benefit is a pretty tempting area because seven million families claim child benefit, it costs around £13 billion and only last week we had the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies saying very difficult to make the sums add UP very difficult to make the sums add up unless you start to make savings in child benefit. An inquest has begun into the deaths of three army reservists who died during a selection test for the SAS two years ago. The three collapsed during an exercise in the Brecon Beacons on one of the hottest days of the year and died later in hospital. Our Defence Correspondent, jonathan Beale, is at the inquest in Solihull. It’s been a long and difficult wait for the three families. Their loved ones died nearly two years ago now. They came to this inquest hoping for some answers. All three of these young men said they wanted to join the SAS because they wanted to be the best of the best, but their families never imagined that they would die in an army exercise in Wales under the supervision of the army. The families of the three soldiers arrived at Solihull coroner’s court to find out how and why they died in a training exercise supervised by the army. The three part-time soldiers were among a group of 78 taking part in the tough selection test to join the SAS reserves here on the unforgiving rugged terrain of the Brecon Beacons. It was one of the hotst days of the year. These photographs show the rescue that for them came too late. Eyewitnesses said it was clear the soldiers were in distress, feeling the effects of the heat and exhaustion before they collapsed. Craig Roberts and Edward Mayer died on the mountain. james was taken to hospital but never recovered. All three were described in court as extremely fit young men. In a statement, the family of Craig Roberts described how they expressed their anger when they asked an officer why the exercise hadn’t been cancelled because of the heat. They say they were told it would have been too much paperwork. The army’s been using the unforgiving surroundings of the Brecon Beacons for Special Forces selection for decades. On that july day, the three soldiers were having to complete a 26 kilometre march carrying heavy quit via five checkpoints within a set time. But with the temperatures set to rise to nearly 30 degrees. The coroner said she wants to examine how the soldiers were prepared and briefed for that day and what risk assessments were carried out by the army and the precauses taken if something went wrong, as it did for Craig, Edward and james on that hot July Craig, Edward and james on that hot july day. The coroner, Louise Hunt, made clear she’ll be using the Human Rights Act, the right to life to make sure that the army fulfilled its duty of care to these three young men. We are expecting this inquest to last several weeks and we’re going to hear from more than 50 witnesses, some serving soldiers within the SAS who’ll give evidence behind a screen to protect their identity. And the Ministry of Defence says a Royal Marine trainee has collapsed and died during an exercise on Dartmoor. The man, who hasn’t been named, was based at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone in Devon. He was taking part in a 30-mile march on Thursday, the last major test of the course. A spokesman for the MoD said the cause of death was unknown. Two planned strikes by rail workers have been called off. Members of the RMT union had been due to walk out for 21+ hours on Thursday evening, and for 1+8 hours next week, in a dispute over pay. After four days of talks they say they’ll take proposals for a 2% pay rise to members. America’s intelligence agencies have lost a number of key anti-terror powers after the Senate failed to reach an 11th hour deal to retain them. The White House has described their failure as an ""irresponsible lapse"". Our World Affairs correspondent jonny Dymond has more. Four years Americans have had records of their phone calls swept UP records of their phone calls swept up by the National Security agency as part of a counterterror strategy. But at midnight last night in the US the legal authority for that surveillance ended. One senator called a halt. We are collecting all American citizens’ called a halt. We are collecting all American citizens’ records all the time, this is what we fought the revolution over. Are we going to give up ourfreedom? Are we going to go along and sayjust take it? This wasn’t the usual battle between a Democratic president and a Republican Congress. The Republicans, divided, turned on each other. We shouldn’t be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more sophisticated and aggressive, and we certainly shouldn’t be doing so based on a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the wake of the unlawful actions of Edward Snowden. Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security agency was collecting huge amounts of data about Americans’ phone calls. That forced the American government to put in extra safeguards on the gathering of phone records. In a national address on Saturday, President Obama demanded action. This shouldn’t be about politics, it is a matter of national security. Terrorists are not going to suddenly stop plotting against us at midnight tomorrow and we shouldn’t surrender the tools that keep us safe. That would be reckless. We shouldn’t allow it to happen. Butjust a reckless. We shouldn’t allow it to happen. But just a few hours ago it did happen. The monitoring stopped. The Senate will meet later in the week to try to pass new authorisation, but for the first time in a long time, the scope of American surveillance has shrunk. Our top story this lunchtime: Doctors say they’ve seen spectacular results from a new way of treating the most serious forms of skin cancer. And still to come, the story of a marathon achievement for a 92-year-old grandmother. In the sport at half-past, police will be investigating the post-match melee that marred the final at Fer Park. The team behind Solar Impulse always knew this was going to be the toughest leg of their attempt to fly around the world using only the power of the sun. The plane took off from Nanjing in China on Saturday, heading across the Pacific Ocean on a 5,000-mile journey to Hawaii. But this morning it was forced to land injapan because of bad weather. The hope now is that it will be able to start again as soon as conditions improve. john Sudworth reports. Above the clouds today there was disappointment for the Swiss pilot. With the solar plane flying well and one day into what was meant to be a six-day solo flight across the Pacific the decision was made to land injapan. The team at mission control in Monaco had seen trouble ahead, a large cold front blocking the way across the ocean. It is a delay, of course that disappoints us, but at the moment everybody is extremely happy with the behaviour of the plane. It is just the weather that doesn’t fit. Everything we could do has been done but we cannot control the weather so we land in Nagoya and wait for better conditions and then we continue. Early on Sunday morning, Solar Impulse took off from eastern China for the latest leg of its round the world attempt. With the wingspan of a jumbojet but the body world attempt. With the wingspan of a jumbo jet but the body weight of a family car, the experimental plane needs favourable winds because it flies slowly and it needs clear skies during the day so that its solar cells can charge the battery for night-time flying. They have decided that to carry on into the weather front would simply be too risky. We are not daredevils, we are explorers, so we have to put the safety on top of the priorities and this is why we have made already this type of training. The team is prepared for every dilemma and negotiations with other countries. The team is determined to recuperate injapan and then The team is determined to recuperate in japan and then try again, but the question must remain - in japan and then try again, but the question must remain - if this good weather playing is so sensitive to bad, then will it ever find its way across the world’s biggest ocean? The authorities in Bangladesh have charged 1+2 people with murder in connection with the collapse of a garment factory in which more than 1100 people died. They’re accused of ignoring warnings not to allow workers into the Rana Plaza building the day before it collapsed. Let’s speak to our correspondent in Delhi, Sanjoy Majumder. This was a terrible tragedy and it’s clearly taken a long time for anyone to be charged. Yes, that’s right. It was thought earlier that the men would be charged with culpable homicide, something that attracts a prison term of about seven years, but these new charges of murder, if convicted, could see them getting the death sentence. We understand one reason it has taken so long for anyone to be charged is because among the 1+2 people charged more than a dozen government officials, including the mayor, and they needed permission from the Government to go ahead and include those government officials and charge them with these fresh charges. That’s the reason it has taken so long. Many thanks. For the first time since September, accident and emergency departments in England have met their target of seeing 95% of patients within four hours. It’s a target that hadn’t been hit for 33 weeks in a row. Let’s speak to our Health Correspondent jane Dreaper. Why has this happened? There has been a slight easing of the winter pressures, just towards the end of last month hospitals in England edged past the line. These are the best figures since the end of September last year but the biggest hospitals are still struggling to meet the target. There are also a lot of patients still coming through the door, 1+35,000 in the last week that was measured. And a warning from the Royal College of medicine that the system is at full capacity. Elsewhere in the UK hospitals are struggling to meet the targets, in Scotland 92% of patients seen within four hours, Northern Ireland 71+% of patients, and it might bejune but in the NHS is the next set of winter pressures are never far thanks. -- never far away. Many thanks. Anyone who employs a carer or a nanny may have to pay towards their pensions under new laws which come into force today. Under the Government’s auto-enrolment programme, any business with up to 30 staff will have to make a contribution, including people who employjust one person, so long as that employee is paid more than £10,000 a year. Simon Gompertz has more. If you employ help in the home, paying the more than £10,000, you might have to contribute to their pension scheme. It could be a nanny, it might be a carer. Who will pay? It could even affect people who employ carers with money provided by the council. My fear is that in having to pay a pension contribution, effectively what it will mean is that people who don’t employ their own care staff will find that they have the number of hours that they can afford to employ somebody caught. For a carer or any employee paid £15,000, the employer’s payment would be £92 per year with the rate rising to 277 in three years. The more they earn, the bigger the contribution. Everybody who is working properly should have access to pension contributions. If you have employed a carer I don’t think you would have that much spare money anyway. Whether the carer is from an agency or provided by the council, you do not have to provide the pension but it is not always working like that. If the salary you PGY working like that. If the salary you pay is over £10,000 per year, you will need to automatically enrolled that carer into a pension scheme. Everybody should have the same opportunities to save for their retirement, that’s what the Government says, but it could involve an extra cost and for the very smallest employers that could be difficult to cover. This comes from a drive to make every employer help to provide a pension, including Gary with a cable laying business and one employee, he accepts the responsibility. As a businessman it is not good for me, but for the person who works for me, he is a good lad and he deserves something at the end of it. Everyone has the right to a pension, and someone has to pay. A heatwave that has killed more than two thousand people in India could finally be about to come to an end. It’s lasted for more than six weeks. But forecasters are hoping that the approaching monsoon season will finally break a spell that has seen temperatures reach 50 degrees celsius. Lucas de Yong reports. In India where money is short and people have to work to survive, the rules to avoid heatwaves are easier said than done. What are we going to do? We are poor. If we don’t work, how will we feed ourselves? If we load more material on the card it is difficult to pull. This city has been hit hardest. I cannot bear this heat, what can we do? There are power cuts that make it very difficult during the day. I can’t bear this heat any more. Thunderstorms brought some relief over the weekend, but for southern India the end is forecast to be near. The monsoon season is bearing down on the country, and with it comes the much welcomed calling embrace of the monsoon rains. A 92-year-old grandmother has become the oldest woman in the world to complete a marathon. Harriette Thompson finished the race in San Diego in nearly seven and a half hours, saying afterwards that she felt a little stiff. Laura Trant has the story. Showing people decades younger how it is done. Crowds gathered to watch 92-year-old make history. Iam amazed that they are interested! I just feel I don’t deserve this, but I’m enjoying it. She is no novice, it is her 16th rock and roll Marathon and it is not the first time she has broken a record. Last year she was the fastest woman over 92 run a marathon. This year ‘s marathon was her toughest year yet. As a cancer survivor, Harriet runs to raise money for the leukaemia and lymphoma Society and has raised around $100,000 so far, that’s about £66,000, but this year her purpose is even closer to home. My son right now is a captain in the Navy and a Methodist minister, but he found out he has cancer so I’m running for him. That is a big incentive. Harriet didn’t run marathons until she was 76. This year her other son helped her stay in her stride. And this course my son was with me, and he kept feeding me and giving me all sorts of drinks. I got so tired of hearing Harriet! Ithink sorts of drinks. I got so tired of hearing Harriet! I think I’m going to change my name! 92 years young, Harriette Thompson finished the marathon in seven hours, 21+ minutes. She’s not sure she will run another one but then again she said that last year. You are watching the BBC News at one o’clock. Our top story today: doctors say they’ve seen spectacular results from a new way of treating the most serious forms of skin cancer. In a moment, we’ll have the weather plus the news where you are. But first, here is the sport. A very good afternoon to you. England’s cricketers have it all to do if they are to save the second test against New Zealand. They have been sets what would be a record 1+55 to win the match against New Zealand. Patrick gearry is at Headingley for us. Surely a task too tall for England? It was already tough when they arrived here this morning. England resumed on 338-6. If you are batting last, scoring anything over 300 is difficult, but by the time New Zealand declared, they were on 1+51+ runs ahead of England so the home side right unagainst it here in Leeds. Headingly is no place to be last in the queue when it comes to batting, let alone when you need more than 300. Before they could start that chase, there was more waiting to do. And more runs to get. Unfortunately, New Zealand were still batting, even worse, Watling was. 100 and counting, only Anderson, the new ball and an athletic Root could stop the counting. Not everyone showed Root’s intent. Southee offered this and no-one went for it so Southee went for England. A few swings of the bat later he and Craig had New Zealand over 1+00. By the time Southee Miskiwed one, he ensured England would need a world record run chase. No wonder there were no many celebrations at his wicket. If New Zealand had any inhibitions left they’d gone. Craig cut loose. His new partner Henry matched him after three sixes and an over, he had seen enough. England faced an awkward half hour before lunch, they survived but the fate of the Test match will get pend on how long they keep New Zealand waiting. -- will depend. Hope comes in the form of England’s two openers who batted so well in the first innings. If things stay clear, New Zealand will have five sessions to bowl England out but there is the chance of some rain so you may get a few people here looking hopefully up at the skies. Police are to meet with the Scottish Football Association to investigate the post-match melee that marred the premiership play-off final between Motherwell and Rangers yesterday. Our reporter Chris McLoughlin is with us now. On-field punishments handed out yesterday but that may not be the end of the repercussions? That’s right. There’ll be a long investigate sthun into what transpired at the end of the game that Motherwell won 3-0, securing premiership football for next season. I was on the field when it kicked off literally behind me. Moshini, the Rangers defender lashed out with fists and feet and, after the players were cleared up the tunnel, we had police horses as well trying to clear fans off the pitch. The league authorities say that they will take their time, they are speaking to the Scottish FA. That is the governing body here in Scotland. They’ll also speak to K police K Scotland to find out what is next. As I say, this was supposed to be the showpiece end to the Scottish league season, some shameful seasons we’ll find out the implications of them over the next couple of days. Tennis and at the French Open, Andy Murray is on court vying for a spot in the quarter-finals. He continued his recent fine form on clay early on against the favourite jeremy Chardy. He found the second set much more difficult than the first. He’s just lost the second set in the last few moments. That is all the sport for now. Back to you. From today, smokers in China’s capital Beijing will no longer be able to smoke in indoor public places like offices, shops and restaurants. Anyone caught lighting up will face tough fines, as the authorities try to curb a habit that kills more than a million people in China every year. From Beijing, Martin Patience reports. China, a smokers’ paradise, a country that consumes a third of the world’s cigarettes. More than half of the men smoke here, but at what a cost? A million people die a year from smoking-related illnesses. Now, Beijing says it wants to quit for good. The capital is banning smoking in public places, including at restaurants like this one. The thing is there has been smoking bans before but they haven’t worked, and what is surprisingly about China is the way people just break the rules. If they want a cigarette, then they just pull them out and smoke away, but the authorities say that this time around it’s going to be different, and if you do smoke in a public place, you face a heavy fine. TRANSLATION: I think the ban would be hard to enforce in China. There are simply too many smokers. If you really want to ban smoking, you should shut down the cigarette factories. If they banned smoking, I am not coming to Beijing. Smoking in public places harms everyone. I think the ban can work but everyone needs to be on board. Smoking was once common among China’s leaders. Chairman Mao and his successor Deng Xiaoping were rarely seen without a cigarette in hand, but the current president Xi jinping has bucked the trend. He has quit, and that is because the government finally realises the cost of smoking, say anti-tobacco campaigners. TRANSLATION: Tobacco taxes are a huge source of revenue for the government, but the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses are now higher. President Xi talks about the China dream, but says that first of all you must be healthy. If you smoke and are sick there will be no China dream. But talking about quitting and actually doing it are two very different things. And China is bound to suffer nicotine withdrawals during the process. Bolt bolt let us take a look at the weather now with Tomasz. A hint of summer soon? It will warm up summersoon? It will warm up a little bit, especially towards the end of the week But I’m not convinced it will last very long and before that actually happens, it will get a little worse over the next 12 hours or so. By this even, many western areas will be engulfed by lots of rain. There’ll be strong winds too. This is the area of low pressure whizzing in our direction. It’s unusual for the time of year 20 get a deep and nasty area of low pressure like that, but certainly not unheard of. We get gale force winds this time of the year and 1st june in meteorology is the first day of summer and june in meteorology is the first day of summerand this of summer and this is what we have to greet us. The weather will test our patience a bit as far as summer is concerned. 6 o’clock in the evening, you can see the heavy rain in western Scotland. It’s mostly gone through Northern Ireland. You can see dark arrows with the white numbers. Those are the gusts of winds. In some coasts, we could see 50-60, maybe even 70mph gusts, which is pretty unusual for the 1st june and really windy in the south-west too on the coast and even inland the wind is strong. In the East Midlands and East Anglia, it won’t reach you until this evening. The wind and rain will rattle all our windows tonight. Eventually, the heavy rain and strong winds should blow themselves out and end up into the North Sea. It won’t die down completely. Tomorrow morning, still quite cloudy and drizzly, particularly across the south of the country and still quite windy, so tomorrow not a calm day. A blustery sort of day. We won’t get the severe gales that we’ll get later on today across many western areas. On balance, Tuesday is not a bad day. Not an awful lot of sunshine around and not that much rainfall. A cool brisk day with a bit of brightness here and there with temperatures at around 15 or 16. For Wednesday, that is when things start to improve a bit so the winds die down. The temperatures start to creep up again. It will feelwarmer temperatures start to creep up again. It will feel warmer because the winds are lighter but I think maybe nudging up to 19 or 20 in London. Then this warmth, so a hint of summer, this is the wayward heat that will come out of Spain and France around about Thursday or Friday time. We could see temperatures creeping up. Really, as I say, before that, we have to get through today, tomorrow and Wednesday. A wet and windy start to the week, then turning drier and towards the end of the week we could be talking about mid, high 20s but not for too long. Thank you. That is all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Goodbye. Good afternoon, I’m Asad Ahmad. The number of people who died in fires in London has halved over the past five years. London Fire Brigade also says there were fewer fires overall, than at any time in nearly half a century. The figures are the first to be released since budget cuts to the service last year but the Fire Brigades Union disputes the figures, as Sarah Harris reports. This is the kind of fire damage every homeowner dreads. The latest figures by the London Fire Brigade show the number of incidents in the capital’s dropped significantly in the last five years. Even calls to the Fire Brigade fell by 21%, serious injuries 29% and deaths by 50%. Over many years, we have been targeting specifically vulnerable groups more prevalent to falling victim to fire, people with mental disability, smokers, older people on their own. We have done home fire safety visits and working in much closer cooperation with partners like the local authorities and police in order to find out where fires are more likely to occur then taking proactive preventative work to stop them from occurring. The Fire Brigades’ Union has disputed the figures saying that usually you would take the figures over ten years sothat would mean the reduction was only 18% rather than 50%. What is your response? 18% is still a significant improvement. If the figures were going in the opposite direction, they might have a point. I don’t believe they do. The prevention work’s been stepped UP The prevention work’s been stepped up considerably in more recent times and I think the 50% reduction you are seeing as a result of that is evidence that it’s working. He admits the slight extension to call out times of eight to nine seconds is probably due to the closure of ten fire stations in the capital last year but claims their response figures are still the best in the country. What have been described as Oliver Twist scenarios are said to be happening on the streets of London, as children are forced to pick-pocket, shoplift and beg. Former Metropolitan Police detective Kevin Hyland, who’s now the Government’s first Anti-Slavery Commissioner, says the problem ""is alive and kicking in London"". He says until now child slavery has been a hidden crime. A hidden form of abuse where girls as young as 10 have their chests pounded with hot objects to destroy any signs of breast development is believed to be taking place in London. The mutilation is known as breast ironing, and the practise originates from Cameroon in west African. It’s carried out to deter unwanted male attention and rape by delaying the signs of a girl becoming a woman. But it often leaves victims disfigured and psychologically damaged. The trauma that they grow up with, seeing their body image destroyed, can affect their relationship because of their trauma, because of their breast being destroyed. I can’t explain it. It’s too much. And you can see a full report on that story on our early evening news at 6.30 on BBC One and later on our website. Police officers in London who carry tasers are being urged to wear body cameras to make sure they’re used properly. In the past two years alone, the Metropolitan police fired tasers 500 times, twice on children aged 11+. Conservatives on the Greater London Assembly say cameras would protect the most vulnerable from the device which discharges thousands of volts. Officers also fired nearly a dozen times on those aged over 60. Arsenal midfielderjack Wilshere is facing criticism for leading fans in an expletive-laden chant during the club’s FA Cup victory celebrations in north London yesterday. The 23-year-old took to the microphone in front of thousands of fans outside the Emirates Stadium, mocking Premier League rivals Tottenham. He launched a similar attack during last year’s victory celebrations. The club is yet to comment. Let us take a look at the weather bmmu Let us take a look at the weather forecast now with Elizabeth. We have a Met Office weather warning out for the strength of the winds gusting at times across the capital at 1+0-50mph. That warning valid today and for the overnight period and for most of tomorrow. The strength of the winds increase this afternoon. Brightness in the east, many places dry until this evening. Through the evening, we get the heavy rain spreading in from the west and the winds will strengthen considerably, peaking through the early hours tomorrow. A wet start to ",,

And a promise of better services and cheaper fares, as TFL take over more of London’s rail lines. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Skin cancer kills more than 2,000 people every year in the UK. But now doctors say they’ve seen ""spectacular"" results after a British-led clinical trial treated people with the most serious form of skin cancer using two drugs in combination. In almost 60% of cases, the therapy caused tumours to shrink. The treatment - which helps the immune system to recognise tumours and then destroy them - has also been used successfully for other cancers like lung and bowel. Our Medical Correspondent Fergus Walsh reports. In the long war on Cancer, a significant victory for science. Vicky Brown thought she had a few months to live when diagnosed with advanced melanoma, which had spread through her body. She was among nearly 1,000 patients on a trial run by the Royal Marsden Hospital. The drugs she has received meant she has been well enough to travel the world. I feel extremely fortunate that I was in the right time at the right place to be offered this trial. It has given me two more years with my granddaughter and I have managed to travel. I have just come back from a week with some friends in Tampa. The consultant who led the trial showed me the tumour in Vicky’s lung. We call that a lung metastasis, so it is a melanoma that has spread to the lung. It then disappeared after she was treated with two drugs which trained her immune system to unmask the cancer. We have always known with immunotherapy that if the immune system can be stimulated to attack and recognise the cancer, there probably is the possibility of controlling or maybe even curing that cancer over very long periods of time. What is unique about the drugs that Vicky was given is they don’t kill cancerous tissues themselves, but rather allow our immune system to do so. Within our bodies is an army of cells designed to destroy any organism which poses a threat, but spare healthy tissue. Cancer cells, which are corrupted copies of normal human tissue, can sometimes be difficult for those killer cells to identify and in some cases they inhibit the immune response through a chemical handshake on the cell’s surface. The new drugs block the handshake, so the killer cells see the cancer for what it is. The immune system is reprogrammed to destroy the cancer. Immunotherapy has now come of age as a means of fighting cancer. Notjust melanoma, but it is working against lung, bowel and other common tumours. This is a completely new approach and it is dramatic because of the durability of the length of the responses that are seen and the number of patients now responding. So it is really a game changer in the field, it is a new era. Vicky will need more treatment to clear a new tumour in her lung, so it is too early to talk about curing advanced cancer. But immunotherapy is one of the most exciting developments in cancer for years. And Fergus Walsh is with me. The word breakthrough can be overused, but in this case, is itjustified? I think it is, and this is part of a new era in cancer which will lead to increased survival. Already, halfpipe cancer patients live with increased diagnosis -- halfpipe cancer patients live with increased diagnosis -- half of cancer patients. Immunotherapy is harnessing your own body’s potential to fight cancer. The trouble is, these new drugs are expensive to develop and they are costed very high indeed. just one of the drugs that Vicky Brown is taking costs £75,000 per patient and only today, the health watchdog rejected a new drug for over very the health watchdog rejected a new drug for oververy in drug for over very in cancer which targets a genetic weakness in the cancer, much less toxic than chemotherapy, well-tolerated by women on the trial, and they rejected it because it costs ÂlIooo a month and it hadn’t shown in a survival benefit, and there are loads of these new drugs coming through and society is going to have to make a judgement on what value it puts on extending the lives of cancer patients against all the other demands on the NHS. Thank you. An inquiry into why a crematorium failed to return the ashes of babies to their bereaved relatives has called for a national inspector of crematoria to be introduced. More than 50 families were affected. It comes after a BBC investigation last year discovered that hundreds of other parents had had similar experiences over several years. Sian Lloyd reports. We were hearing her laugh and chuckle and being very happy. And a few hours later, I found her chuckle and being very happy. And a few hours later, Ifound her dead. Olivia wasjust four few hours later, Ifound her dead. Olivia was just four months old when she died. Herfamily Olivia was just four months old when she died. Her family say their grief has been made worse by not knowing what happened to her remains. I would rather not be doing this at all. I would would rather not be doing this at all. Iwould rather all. I would rather have my daughter here. But I can’t have her here and I don’t know where she is. I never will. Almost 60 families were told by Emstrey crematorium in Shrewsbury that there would be no remains of babies who died before their first birthday. Over the past six months, practices here dating back to 1996 have been under investigation. Today, families heard the report’s findings. The news was distressing. Equipment hadn’t always been maintained and staff did not know how to use it in a way that would enable infant remains to be returned to parents. Shropshire Council had commissioned this report, although the site had been run by the former Shrewsbury In Action Borough Council at the time. Is it something we should have been aware of? You assume that people are doing their jobs and are doing it properly. And there is nothing you can say. I said sorry but sorry sounds pretty hollow, doesn’t it? It has been a long and painful wait for the families desperate to find out what happened here to their children’s remains. Today’s report gives them some answers but it could also lead to changes in burial and cremation laws. The report once the Government to introduce a single code of practice for baby and infant cremations. It calls for an independent inspector of crematoria, similar to the system in Scotland and once minimum standards of training for all crematorium staff. Tonight, some of the families came to remember. There are no remains. I can’t get any comfort from that. Changes have been made in Scotland after cases there were identified. Today’s report calls for national guidelines to ensure practices are the same everywhere. Sian Lloyd, BBC News, Shrewsbury. An inquest into the deaths of three Army reservists who died after collapsing during an SAS training exercise on a hot day in the Brecon Beacons has been told it wasn’t postponed because that would have involved ""too much paperwork"". The men were taking part in a march on one of the hottest days of 2013. Our Defence Correspondent jonathan Beale was at the inquest in Solihull. After a long wait almost two years, the families of the three soldiers arrived at the coroner’s court to find out how and why they died in a training exercise supervised by the army. The three part-time soldiers were among a group of 78 taking part in the top selection test to join the SES. Here on the unforgiving rugged terrain of the Brecon Beacons -- SPS. It was one of the hottest days of the year. These photographss showed the rescue that came too late. Eyewitnesses say it was clear the soldiers were in distress, feeling the effects of the heat and exhaustion, before they collapsed. james Dunsby was described by his wife in court as hard to forget and very handsome. He was used to the heat, having already served in Afghanistan alongside Prince Harry. Edward mayor was described by his father as superbly fit. He told the court he never imagined his son would die in a training exercise under the supervision of his own officers. And Craig Roberts was remembered as a wonderful, warm and genuinely funny man. In a statement, his parents told the court that when they identified their son’s body they asked an officer why the exercise had not been postponed because of the heat. They were angered when the officer replied that it would have involved too much paperwork. The coroner Louise Hunt said this inquest was important to bring the full facts to light and expose any culpability or discreditable conduct. She said she had focused on the Army’s duty of care and whether the proper preparations and training and risk assessments had been carried out. The Brecon Beacons have long been the testing ground tojoin Britain’s elite special forces. On average, only one in ten pass. Soldiers have the March 16 miles against the clock, carrying 50 pounds of equipment. Over the next few weeks, the court will hear evidence from over 50 witnesses, including many serving members of the SAS, who will be giving evidence from behind a screen to protect their identities. The inquest is expected to conclude later this month. jonathan Beale, BBC News at Solihull coroner’s court. The Government is calling on the Fifa President Sepp Blatter to stand down despite his re-election - amid a criminal investigation into the running of football’s world governing body. Our Sports Editor Dan Roan is at the BBC Sports Centre in Salford. Dan, you’ve learnt more about who voted for Sepp Blatter to remain in charge - despite the allegations? That’s right. The fallout from the re-election of Sepp Blatter today reached Westminster, a sign perhaps of how much anger there is about the allegations of corruption which emerged last week. One MP said that Sepp Blatter had benefited from what he called mafioso cronyism and another described him as a Klingon, and john Whittingdale hinted that the Government could back the idea of a breakaway, an alternative World Cup. How realistic could that be? It will be difficult. One of the problems the FA faces is there is not the consensus in Uefa to agree for something quite as drastic as that. Infact, we have learned that at least ten European countries went against the orders of the Uefa boss Michel Platini and backed Sepp Blatter, including his own country, France, so the idea of a World Cup boycott seems unlikely and it seems more likely that personal stance like that of Heather Rabbatts, who stepped down today from the Fifa task force, but it will not worry Sepp Blatter too much. What will, perhaps, will be the criminal investigations in the United States and Switzerland. The Government is speeding up plans to double the amount of free childcare for working parents in England. Trials offering 30 hours of free care for three and four year olds will now begin in September- a year early. However, childcare providers in England have warned of ""meltdown"" because of underfunding. Our political Correspondent Vicki Young reports. Providing quality childcare can be expensive. And David Cameron says that for many families, the numbers don’t add up. Some nurseries cost more than a parent can earn. He says more free care is essential if workers’ potential is to blossom. If we want to be a success and take on the world and win, we need to make the most everybody’s talents and there are so many talented parents out there who can’t work because of the cost of childcare, and if we help them. .. the cost of childcare, and if we help them... We are not saying you have to go out to work, we want to give you the choice. So what extra childcare provision is on offer in England? At the moment, all three and-year-olds are entitled to 15 three hours a week. The plan is to double that to 30 hours a week if both parents work. The Government say it could help more than 600,000 families. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, children get between 10-15 hours of free childcare week and parents in England welcomed the plans to go further. Any mum who wants to be a mum and also work will obviously be appreciative of any Government funded childcare that they can get. As a parent, it is definitely fantastic news but I think you need to look at it in the wider picture as well, to the childcare providers. How is it going to impact their business? Many nurseries and childminders are finding it hard to break even because of a shortfall in Government funding. Some are warning of a meltdown in the system. The owner of the South London nursery says the money she gets from the council to pay for the free hours doesn’t cover the actual cost of delivering the care. Unfortunately for us, right now, doing the 30 hours, we could not do it. Offering it is quite a big thing and the cash flow is a business, we don’t get fees upfront, etc, so to have that as an extra burden, I think it will provide us with... We would pull out. Ministers say they will start an urgent consultation with the childcare industry to sort out the funding problem, but if they cannot resolve it, then nurseries and childminders might find they simply cannot afford to provide the extra three hours and parents might discover that a generous election offer is nothing more than an empty promise. Forthis offer is nothing more than an empty promise. For this scheme to work, the childcare sector will have to expand and ministers now accept that will cost more money. Our top story this evening.

A plane attempting to fly around the world using only the power of the sun has been forced to make an unscheduled landing in japan to avoid bad weather. The Solar Impulse was on the seventh - and longest - leg of itsjourney, from China to Hawaii when its mission control centre decided to abort the journey, for the safety of the pilot as Rupert Wingfield Hayes reports. At close to midnight and almost Ao hours in the air at the massive wing of the solar impulse buy the gently to land injapan. The Solar Impulse team knew that this attempt to fly a plane across the Pacific Ocean powered only by the sun would be a difficult gamble. And so it is turning out to be. Earlier in the day over the north ofjapan the plane was flying perfectly. The skies were clear and the solar powered battery is fully charged. So wear a head out in the Pacific and ugly weather front was beginning to build. A front that could destroy this fragile plane. And so the painful decision was taken to land. There is great relief that the Solar Impulse has made it here safely. But also tinged with disappointment because of course it should not be here, it should be way out over the Pacific Ocean. Now they do not know when they will be able to make the attempt again. We need good weather here and also we need to find a way to fly up to Holloway, I guess it will take a few days until we find this specific window. In the latest flight from China to japan the Solar Impulse has proved it can charge is battery is enough during the day to keep flying all right. But the weather is proving its greatest enemy. The team needs at least five clear days and nights to make the long crossing to Holloway. But the Pacific typhoon season approaching time is now short to find another one. -- to Hawaii. The President of the European Commission, jean-Claude juncker, has said David Cameron wants to use the in-out referendum to tie Britain closer to the other 27 member states- and that a question of British exit from the EU doesn’t arise. Our Political Correspondent Carole Walker is in Westminster. Yes these are his first comment since he met David Cameron a week ago. They are significant because he appears to dismiss even the possibility that the UK could vote to leave the EU. What is said is that the question of a British exit does not arise. He said that David Cameron wants to permanently dock contrary to EU. A spokeswoman for David Cameron said the Prime Minister always warned there would be plenty of noises from different politicians honest but the British policy is clear, to reform the British relationship with the EU and give British people the final say in a referendum before 2017. And Philip Hammond Foreign Secretary has been reinforcing that in the Commons this afternoon. But the comments from jean-Claudejuncker will annoy jean-Claude juncker will annoy Eurosceptics. And the jean-Claudejuncker will annoy Eurosceptics. And the Ukip leader Nigel Farage has already said he does not know what the British people want and should wind his neck in. Rail workers have called off two planned strikes after being offered an improved pay deal. Members of the RMT union had been due to walk out for 24 hours on Thursday evening, and for A8 hours next week. After four days of talks with Network Rail, the union and two others - the TSSA and Unite - agreed to consider a new deal, which includes a 2% pay rise this year. Anyone who employs a carer or a nanny may have to pay towards their pensions, under new laws which come into force today. Under the government’s auto-enrolment programme, any business with up to 30 staff will have to make a contribution, including people who employjust one person - if that employee is paid more than £10,000 a year. Simon Gompertz has the details. It is the biggest pension sign up ever, but if you are the employer, like Hannah, who has cerebral palsy, you are left wondering who will make the contributions. In her case, for two carers. The council provides her budget, but she decides how it is spent. It is quite daunting, because I don’t know whether the council are going to give me the extra funding to cover it all whether it is going to be coming out of my purse. For an Foran employee, paid, say, £15,000, the employer’s payment would be £92 a year, rising to £277 in three years’ time and the more they earn, the bigger the contribution. There is uncertainty over whether some cash-strapped councils plan to cover the cost for people like Hannah, but the Government said today they would have to, and give her the money to be a pension provider. This is part of a drive to get everyone saving in pensions, if they are not in them already. Millions have been signed up in big businesses and now nearly four million are being targeted elsewhere and employers, large or small will have to up contributions. You have to give an incentive, a reason for people to come to work. Whether carers or cafe workers, if you give everyone the right to their own private pension, someone has to PaY~ This bridge in Paris has become a shrine for amorous tourists and Parisiens alike. Hundreds of thousands of padlocks with people’s initials on have been attached to the railings on the Pont des Arts - left behind as a token of love. Lucy Williamson reports. It’s a relationship that lasted for more than a century. Paris and its lovers. They come to propose, exchange kisses on the banks of the Seine, and since 2008, fasten their names forever to the Pont Des Arts with a metal padlock. But the weight of the world’s love has proved too much for the city of romance. Worried about the bridge’s stability, the local government has ordered the locks to be removed from the Pont Des Arts, all A5 tonnes of them. It’s possible to say I love you or to have a romantic trip in Paris without putting love locks on the bridges. And we want to say also that Paris will stay the city of love, the city of romanticism, but it is possible without love locks. But will it be? It is something special and unique and people travel all over the world to see it. It has been in movies. It is a little bit sad so we decided that on our trip we would try to be one of the last people to put a lock on the bridge. But this particular love trend is not French at all. It is Serbian. Meant to invoke the loyalty of one’s betrothed. And many French remain unmoved. A metallic tumour, one writer called it. The love locks outgrew their original home, here on the Pont Des Arts, long ago. Now they cover part of the Pont Neuf just over there. And many other bridges along the river. Not to mention other sites around the city. The problem for the authorities here is notjust the romantic allure of the Pont Des Arts, it is the romantic allure of the whole of Paris. But banning it could prove equally tricky. As Paris should know, when it comes to lovers’ games, there’s nothing quite like the illicit. Harriette Thompson is 92 years old - and she hasjust become the oldest woman in the world to complete a marathon. She finished the race in San Diego in 7 hours and 24 minutes. Afterwards the grandmother - who only took up running at the age 76 - said she didn’t think she’d be alive today if she didn’t run. Laura Tra nt reports. Three, two, one! Showing people decades younger how it’s done. Crowds gathered to watch 92-year-old Harriette Thompson make history. I’m amazed that they’re interested! Ijust feel I don’t deserve this. But I’m enjoying it. She’s no novice. Harriette didn’t start running until she was 76. This her 16th marathon. And it’s not the first time she’s broken a record. Last year, she was the fastest woman over 90 to run it. As a cancer survivor, she runs to raise money to help fight the disease. This year, her son helped her stay in her stride. On this course, my son was with me. He kept feeding me, giving me all sorts of drinks and then everybody... I got so tired of hearing ""Harriette""! I think I will change my name! 92 years young, Harriette finished the marathon in seven hours, 24 minutes and 36 seconds. She is not sure she will run another one. Then again, she said that last year! Time for a look at the weather. Here’s jon Hammond. It isa It is a very windy night. Some of the wind will be disrupted and there is heavy rain sweeping in from the west. The worst of the weather across the West of Scotland with pouring rain. And wind of around 40, 50, 60 miles an hour. That is combined with that heavy rain sweeping in to western parts of England and Wales. We can all expect some rain as we go through the night and some strong wind as well. The skies will clear later further north allowing temperatures to dip into single figures. But mild and muggy across central parts of England and Wales. But some dreary weather to come in the morning but by the afternoon, most of us look forward to some sunshine. Further south in the wind of 40 or 50 miles an hour across central and southern parts could be more disruptive than the wind through this evening. In the brighter spells it feels pleasant enough, still quite muggy in places. On into Wednesday, the wind not so strong. Stillthe On into Wednesday, the wind not so strong. Still the odd shower across the West of Scotland. Plenty of dry and write whether. It could get up into the low 20s in some places.

And a promise of better services and cheaper fares as TfL takes over more of London’s rail lines. Good evening. A new approach to treating skin cancer has produced ‘spectacular’ results, according to a team of British-led researchers. A clinical trial involving patients with melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, could play a big part in the future treatment of the disease. A combination of two drugs was found to reduce tumours in nearly 60% of cases, by stimulating the immune system. Our medical correspondent, Fergus Walsh, has been following one patient’s treatment. In the long war on cancer, a significant victory for science. Vicky Brown thought she had a few months to live when diagnosed with advanced melanoma, which had spread through her body. She was among nearly 1,000 patients on a trial run by The Royal Marsden Hospital. The drugs she’s received meant she’s been well enough to travel the world. I feel extremely fortunate that I was in the right time at the right place, to be offered this trial. It’s given me two more years of my granddaughter and I have managed to travel. I have just come back from a week with some friends in Tampa. The consultant who led the trial showed me the tumour in Vicky’s lung. It is a melanoma, which has spread into the lung. And that is probably... It then disappeared after she was treated with two drugs which trained her immune system to unmask the cancer. We have always known that with immunotherapy that if the immune system can be stimulated to attack and recognise the cancer, there probably is the possibility of controlling or maybe even curing that cancer over very long periods of time. What is different about the drugs Vicky was given is they don’t kill cancerous tissue themselves, but rather enable our immune system to do so. Within our bodies is an army of cells designed to destroy any organism which poses a threat, but spare healthy tissue. Cancer cells, which are corrupted copies of normal human tissue, can sometimes be difficult for those killer cells to identify. In some cases they inhibit the immune response by a chemical handshake on the cell surface. The new drugs block the handshake so the killer cells see the cancer for what it is. The immune system is reprogrammed to destroy the cancer. Immunotherapy has now come of age as a means of fighting cancer. Notjust melanoma, but it is working against lung, bowel and other common tumours. This is a completely new approach and it’s dramatic because of the durability, the length of the responses seen and the number of patients now responding. It is a game-changer in the field. It is a new era. Vicky will need more treatment to clear a new tumour in her lung. So, it is too early to talk about curing advanced cancer, but immunotherapy is one of the most exciting developments in cancer for years. Game-changing is what we heard, break through somewhere else. Underline what is this is about? It is a new era in cancer treatment, with smarter, more targeted drugs. Immunotherapy, this new approach is particularly exciting because it is harnessing the bodyability to fight disease. We are not talking about advanced cures for advanced cancer, and there are side effects but it will extend life. Half of all cancer patients live at least ten years after diagnosis and that will get better. These new drugs come at a cost. They are expensive. just one of the drugs that Vicky Brown receives costs £75,000 per patient. Only today the health watchdog, NICE, rejected a new targeted drug for ovarian cancer which had taken British researchers 2 years to develop because it cost Eli,000 and they said it did not extend life expectancy sufficiently. Given all the pressures on the NHS there are more difficult choices to come. Thank you. An inquiry into failings at a crematorium in Shrewsbury has recommended the appointment of a national inspector to monitor standards in England’s crematoria. It was prompted by the cases of dozens of bereaved parents who did not receive their babies’ ashes from Emstrey crematorium. The investigation found that poor training and out-of-date equipment were mainly to blame. Staff had told the inquiry they were not aware that babies’ ashes could be recovered. Our correspondent Sian Lloyd reports. We were hearing her laugh and chuckle and being very happy. And a few hours later, Ifound her dead. Olivia was just four months old when she died. Her family say their grief has been made worse by not knowing what happened to her remains. I would rather not be doing this at all. I would rather have my daughter here. But I can’t have her here, and I don’t know where she is. I never will. Almost 60 families were told by Emstrey Crematorium that there would be no remains of babies who died before their first birthday. Practices dating back to 1996 have been under scrutiny. Today, families heard the report’s findings. The news was distressing. Parents learned that the remains of very small babies could have been recovered if staff had been shown how to operate equipment in a different way. It was accepted as the norm that there would be no remains. It has been a long and painful wait for the families, desperate to find out what happened here to their children’s remains. Today’s report gives them some answers. But it could also lead to changes in burial and cremation laws. The report wants the Government to introduce a single code of practise for baby and infant cremations. It calls for an independent inspector of crematoria and wants minimum standards of training for all crematorium staff. The controversy over infant remains first came to light in Edinburgh, the BBC then discovered the issue could be more widespread. The law has changed in Scotland, but the man who led the Shropshire investigation wants changes in England and Wales. An inspector is needed in order to establish and maintain public confidence. How many other cases do you think there could be? Impossible for me to say because I focussed on Shropshire. I would be surprised if there were not some. Tonight, some of the families came to remember. Practises at Emtrey have now changed, but that may not be the case everywhere. Sian Lloyd, BBC News, Shrewsbury. David Cameron has admitted that his manifesto promise to expand nursery provision in England will take time to get right. A charity representing 14,000 providers has warned that the system for children aged three and four is already at breaking point due to underfunding, and says the Government needs to boost funding to childcare providers, as our chief political correspondent, Vicki Young, reports. Providing quality childcare can be expensive. And David Cameron says that for many families, the numbers don’t add up. Some nurseries cost more than a parent can earn. He says more free care is essential if workers’ potential is to blossom. If we want to be a great success and take on the world and win, we need to make the most of everybody’s talents and there are so many talented parents out there who can’t work because of the cost of childcare, and if we help them... We are not saying you have to go out to work, we are saying we want to give you the choice. So what extra childcare provision is on offer in England? At the moment, all three and four-year-olds are entitled to 15 free hours a week. The plan is to double that to 30 hours a week if parents work. The Government says it could help more than 600,000 families. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, children get between 10 and 15 hours free childcare a week. Parents in England welcome the plan to go even further. Any mum who wants to be a mum and also work will obviously be appreciative of any Government-funded childcare that they can get. As a parent, it is definitely fantastic news but I think you need to look at it in the wider picture as well, to the childcare providers. How is it going to impact their business? Many nurseries and childminders are finding it hard to break even because of a shortfall in Government funding. Some are warning of a meltdown in the system. The owner of this South London nursery says the money she gets from the council to pay for the free hours doesn’t cover the actual cost of delivering the care. Unfortunately, for us, right now, doing the 30 hours, we could not do it. Offering it is quite a big thing admin-wise and we don’t get fees upfront, et cetera, so to then have that as an extra burden, I think many providers, even though they don’t want to, would pull out. Ministers said today they will start an urgent consultation with the childcare industry to sort out the funding problem, but if they cannot resolve it, then nurseries and childminders might find they simply cannot afford to provide the extra free hours and parents might discover that a generous election offer is nothing more than an empty promise. For this scheme to work, the childcare sector will have to expand and ministers now accept that will cost more money. Vicki Young, BBC News. An inquest into the deaths of three Army reservists on an SAS selection exercise, on the hottest day of 2013, has heard that the exercise wasn’t postponed because that would have involved too much paperwork. The men were all taken ill during a march across the Brecon Beacons in south Wales. The coroner has said she wants to ensure the full facts come to light, as our defence correspondent, jonathan Beale, reports. After a long wait of almost two years, the families of the three soldiers arrived at the Coroners Court to find out how and why they died in a training exercise supervised by the Army. The three part-time soldiers were among a group of 78, taking part in the tough selection test to join the SAS. Here, on the unforgiving rugged terrain of the Brecon Beacons, it was one of the hottest days of the year. These photographs show the rescue, that for them, came too late. Eyewitnesses said it was clear the soldiers were in distress, feeling the effects of the heat and exhaustion before they collapsed. james Dunsby was described by his wife in court as hard to forget and very handsome. He was used to the heat, having already served in Afghanistan, alongside Prince Harry. Edward Maher was described by his father as superbly fit. He told the court he had never imagined his son would die in a training exercise under the supervision of his own officers and Craig Roberts was remembered a warm and funny man. In a statement, his parents told the court when they identified their son’s body, they asked an officer why the exercise had not been postponed because of the heat. They were angered with that officer replied it would have involved too much paperwork. The Coroner said this was important to bring the full facts to light and to experience any cullibility or discredible conduct. She said she would focus on the Army’s duty of care and whether the proper preparations and risk assessments had been carried out. The Brecons have long been the testing ground tojoin Britain’s elite Special Forces. On average, only one in ten pass. Troops have to march 16 miles against the clock, carrying 50lbs of equipment. Over the next few weeks, serving SAS soldiers will be giving evidence from behind a screen to protect their identities. The question, how did this exercise, on a hot summer’s day go so wrong? Ministers will gather in Paris tomorrow to discuss the conflict in Syria and Iraq as new evidence emerges of how Islamic State and other militant groups are recruiting and abusing children. BBC News has obtained video images apparently showing a 1lI-year-old prisoner being tortured by IS. The boy managed to escape and it’s increasingly clear that any of the fighters now being trained are children. Quentin Sommerville’s report contains graphic testimony and scenes of torture. Raqqa in Syria is choked by fear and suspicion. It’s a city where mothers carry guns along with their groceries and children are being terrorised and brutalised, as the following footage shows. They hung him from the ceiling by his arms and then the beating started. Ahmed was just 14 when Islamic State captured and tortured him. TRANSLATION: I thought about my mum, I thought I was going to die and leave my family, my friends and relatives all behind. They started lashing me, electrocuting me to confess, I told them everything. They pretend they are religious, but they are infidels. They pretend to enforce the rules of Muslims, but they are not, they hit and kill people. He was sentenced to death for plotting against IS, but his executioner took pity on him. He escaped. TRANSLATION: When I came to Turkey I used to have nightmares all the time. I used to scream. My mum would hug me and give me water to drink. I can never forget that. I’m getting treatment. Thank God it’s working a bit. Things are better now. I used to have nightmares about it, seeing their shadows. This man says he filmed the beating. He claims to have now left IS. TRANSLATION: I’m regretting every moment. When Ijoined IS, I wasn’t convinced of it. I had to. Although I wasn’t particularly heavy- handed with people, I hope that the people I hurt would forgive me. Children are victims in this war and the Islamic State is exploiting them in other ways, too. Some as young as 12 are being recruited for the battlefield. They are targeted because they are easy to mould and, we are told, they make enthusiastic fighters. They undergo a brutal and extreme training programme that for some is being seen as a rite of passage to manhood. Secular schooling has gone and been replaced by this. Children are shown beheading videos and they then take part in actual executions. And others are being drawn into the fight, too. When he was 15, this boy fought and killed for the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Later he was later forced tojoin IS. TRANSLATION: Don’t call them children. That kid holding a rifle with seven magazines and six grenades is a man, he is a Muslim man. There’s a difference between being a male and a man. The man are the ones taking up arms fighting for the sake of God and defending the Muslim woman’s honour. This is the corruption of a generation. Some of these boys will grow into young men trained to kill and to hate. They will trouble Syria and Iraq for years to come. Quentin Sommerville, BBC News, on the Turkey-Syria border. The President of the European Commission, jean-Claude juncker, has said he believes David Cameron wants to use the in-out referendum on the EU to secure Britain’s permanent membership. In an interview for the German newspaper, Suddeutsche Zeitung, he insisted it was for the British to say what they wanted - and that the EU would then examine that calmly. Our Deputy Political Editor, james Landale, is at Westminster. What do you make of that? Well, jean-Claudejuncker had dinner with jean-Claude juncker had dinner with the jean-Claudejuncker had dinner with the Prime Minister about a week ago. This is the first time he’s spoken about it. What he said was, the idea of Britain leaving the EU is ""a question that does not arise"" - it is not what the British are seeking. He also said that David Cameron was seeking to dock Britain into the EU in the long run. Now, people in there say this is the background noise you are going to get. It matters because if Europe’s leaders discount the possibility of Britain leaving the EU, then that weakens David Cameron’s negotiating hand. That is why tonight in the House of Commons, the Mayor of London has warned that Britain has to be willing to walk away from the EU if it doesn’t get the result it gets. So, that is the kind of pressure David Cameron will come under, both from Brussels and from his backbenchers. Thank you. The Government and the Football Association say all options are on the table following allegations of widespread corruption at Fifa. The newly-appointed Culture Secretary, john Whittingdale, said the culture within world football’s governing body ‘risked ruining international football for a generation’. A boycott of the World Cup had not been ruled out. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, reports. After all the calls for change, more of the same. Sepp Blatter remains at the helm of world football but after his re-election as Fifa President, the resentment is building. The fallout from the sports corruption crisis today discussed in Parliament. He might have survived last Friday thanks to his mafioso cronyism, but he is the tainted leader of a corrupt organisation and by clinging on he is merely dragging Fifa further and further into the mud. There is no doubt that what remained of Sepp Blatter’s credibility has been utterly destroyed. No options should be ruled out at this stage. Some believe one of those options should be a boycott of the next World Cup. The FA are reluctant to take such a stand on their own but could it happen? Sepp Blatter’s opponents hope that a World Cup boycott would hit Fifa where it hurt, drawing away broadcasting and sponsorship revenue. But such drastic action would require the support of clubs, of players, and of national associations, the kind of consensus that currently simply doesn’t exist. After all, European football’s not united - the likes of Spain, France and Russia among ten countries thought to have voted for Blatter. The FA could threaten a rebel tournament with a coalition of like-minded countries like Germany and the Netherlands, as well as the United States and some South American nations, but many are sceptical. It’s nonsensical. Countries like Germany, it has been said in Germany, France, Italy and Spain will not boycott the World Cup. Some have made personal stands - FA director Heather Rabbatts resigning from a Fifa task force in protest. We were all absolutely shocked and my action today is a reflection on those events and why it is important that one withdraws until Fifa addresses its governance. After last week’s arrests of football officials, today one more and three suspensions and news that Fifa Secretary-General jerome Valcke as pulled out of a planned trip to this week’s opening of the Women’s World Cup in Canada. That perhaps a sign of growing concerns at world football’s governing body despite last Friday’s result. Let’s go Fifa. .. Dan Roan, BBC News. Rail workers have called off two planned strikes after being offered an improved pay deal. Members of the RMT had been due to walk out for 24 hours on Thursday and then for 48 hours during next week. The union, along with two others, agreed to consider a new deal which includes a 2% pay rise this year. The UK’s defence spending WILL meet the NATO target of 2% of national wealth in the coming year, but ministers will not give a guarantee about the years to follow. The statement came in response to remarks by the American Defence Secretary, Ashton Carter, who said Britain risked becoming disengaged if its military budget was cut again. He was speaking to the BBC’s Katty Kay. The UK may have a new Government, but it’s dealing with a host of global conflicts that are well established. In Iraq, these latest pictures show Shi’ite militias attacking Islamic State forces in the northern city of Baiji. And in Ukraine, fighters still battle for every shattered street in the city of Donetsk amid fears of a summer offensive. So this would not be the time, the American Defense Secretary told me, for Britain to cut its defence budget. Britain has always had an independent ability to express itself and basically punch above its weight. I’d hate to see that go away because I think it is a great loss to the world when a country of that much history and standing for so much to so many people around the world takes actions which seem to indicate disengagement. We need an engaged United Kingdom. What is your message to your colleagues in London? My message to my colleagues in London, like to all the other capitals of the NATO countries, is to stick to the pledge they all made which was to - if they were below 2%, to achieve 2%. Globally, for defence expenditure, the Saudis lead the way, followed by Russia and the US as a proportion of what each country produces. In the last financial year, the UK spent £34 billion on defence. It’s still one of the highest levels in Europe, even though it’s dropped over the last decade as a proportion of GDP. The Conservatives haven’t promised to protect spending on the Armed Forces and today rejected American concerns. We have people doing things around the world, like very few other countries. Infact, we have the fifth biggest defence budget in the world so it is wrong to suggest that we are retreating. On the contrary. We are investing now for the future. Under the watchful eye of Ho Chi Minh, the US Defense Secretary admired the ranks of America’s old enemy. The irony was lost on no-one. Today, foes have become friends. In Asia, as in the rest of the world, the US now wants to share the burden of global security and it wants to share it with Britain. Katty Kay, BBC News, Vietnam. Solar Impulse - the solar-powered plane attempting to circle the globe - has been forced to land injapan because of bad weather. The aircraft, which set off from China on Saturday, was meant to reach Hawaii by the end of the week. But the pilot, Andre Borschberg, has decided to play safe, as our correspondent, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, reports. At close to midnight and after more than 40 hours in the air, the massive wing of the Solar Impulse glided gently to land at Nagoya Airport injapan. The team had known this attempt to fly a plane across the Pacific Ocean, powered only by the sun, would be a difficult gamble and so it is turning out to be. We have just heard a little cheer go up from the ground crew on the runway behind me. There is great relief that the Solar Impulse has made it here to Nagoya safely. But it is also tinged with disappointment because of course it shouldn’t be here at all, it should be way out over the Pacific Ocean. Earlier in the day, over northern japan, the plane had been flying perfectly. But somewhere ahead, out in the Pacific, an ugly weather front was starting to build. The only choice was to land injapan. Nevertheless, pilot Andre Borschberg says the latest flight proves the Solar Impulse can cross the Pacific. I flew almost 48 hours non-stop. The airplane has been performing well. We had small technical problems but minor things. The team needs five clear days and nights to make the long crossing to Hawaii. I hope in a few days, or within a few weeks, but we have to find a window from japan to Hawaii. Now, with the Pacific typhoon season approaching, time is running short to find another one.

The Sunday Times reported today that experts in Moscow and Beijing had been able to decode some of the documents stolen by the American whistle-blower, Edward Snowden. Our Security Correspondent Gordon Corera reports. Edward Snowden fled America with countless secret files. Today there countless secret files. Today there are claims that all those files are are claims that all those files are now in Russian and Chinese hands and now in Russian and Chinese hands and that British undercover agents have that British undercover agents have had to be moved.

Edward Snowden supporters have argued he is a whistle-blower have argued he is a whistle-blower on surveillance and the governments on surveillance and the governments have tried to discredit him. The US have tried to discredit him.

The convicted paedophile Rolf Harris has been criticised by a solicitor representing his victims, after reports that a letter he wrote from prison mocked them. The letter included song lyrics in which he referred to his victims as ""money-grabbing wenches."" Nick Beake reports. when Rolf Harris was jailed last summer, thejudge said he had no one to blame but himself. Now, though, it seems the 85-year-old believes his victims are responsible for his downfall. The Mail on Sunday claims it was passed a letter written by Harris to a friend. Harris complained that after eight months inside, the inner rage has come to the fore. So he started writing a song about the injustice of it all. The disgraced entertainer accuses his victims out coming of the woodwork and cashing in. ""with the Olympics, the climate’s great in Britain now, His victims were said to be furious and revolted. He shows total contempt for his victims. No understanding of the harm that he has caused. Once again, he displays this arrogance that he did during the trial of someone who thinks he still is very rich and powerful and famous. Harris enjoyed the limelight for decades. But he is now a year into an almost six-year sentence for indecently assaulting four girls. One was just seven. But he boasts that life at Stafford prison is comfortable, writing: Under current rules, Rolf Harris will be automatically released in 2017, halfway through his sentence. Irrespective of his attitudes to his victims. Campaigners say that’s wrong. There is therefore no incentive to change, to behave. Perversely, sending out letters like this will not affect the release date, that can’t be right. A showman whose fall from grace was humiliating and public. But prison seems to have brought no remorse and little concern for the women who said Rolf Harris had destroyed their childhood innocence. Eleanor Hawkins, the British backpackerjailed and fined in Malaysia for going topless on a mountain many locals consider to be sacred, has returned home. Reunited with her family in Derby today, she apologised for her actions. | just want to say how relieved and happy I am to finally be home. I know my behaviour was foolish. I know how much offence we all caused to the local people of Sabah. For that, I am truly sorry. Residents of the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, have been told to stay indoors after widespread flooding allowed animals, including hippos and tigers, to escape from the city 200. At least 12 people have died in the flooding, including three 200 workers as Sarah Rainsford reports. It was described as a hellish whirlpool. The floodwater raged through Tbilisi. At the city 200, it rose right to the roof tops. when that water subsided, there was devastation. Three staff and hundreds of animals have drowned. And now, there is a new danger. Dozens of the animals that survived are on the loose. Some were easy to spot, like this bear, struggling to safety. And so were the hippos. These fast, powerful creatures swept into the city centre where squares turned into swamps. One was captured safely with a tranquilliser. But other animals have been shot and killed. The disaster was caused by relentless rain that began last night. Residents swam for their lives as the local river burst its banks. At least 12 people were drowned. All day, rescuers have been scouring the wreckage, hunting for any people still trapped and for any more wild animals. There are lions, tigers and wolves among those still missing. Residents have been warned to stay indoors. with a hotline to call if they do spot any of the creatures on the loose. It was feared that the Philae lander was destined to become a piece of space debris, despite making history by landing on a comet seven months ago. But today it woke up and briefly transmitted information back to the European Space Agency, thanks to its solar powered batteries recharging, as the comet got closer to the sun. Our Science Editor David Shukman has the story. One of the most startling sights in space. The strange landscape of a comet, seen from closer than ever before. Last November, a tiny lander called Philae touched down. It was a great achievement in exploration. And the emotions at mission control were overwhelming. But then it turned out the lander had bounced into a corner that was too dark for its solar panels. Many assumed the intense cold would destroy the spacecraft but suddenly it started communicating. A tweet from the mission team announced that against all the odds, it was alive. Scientists are thrilled. We knew there was a chance that the strengthening sun would wake Philae up, but we didn’t know for definite. Now it is just our little lander seems to be awake. Poised and ready to do some more exciting work. Down on the surface of the comet, the lander has actually come back to life at the most interesting possible time. Just as this alien world approaches the sun, starts heating up and forming its tail. Suddenly, there is far more potential for discovery than anyone expected. The gas blasting off the comet could be carrying the chemicals needed for life. The lander will have a ringside seat, according to the European Space Agency’s chief science adviser. The location where Philae is should get more active and more material will come up from underneath the surface of the comet and flow passt the lander. That will enable us to get an even better view of what this comet is really made on the inside. Over the centuries, comets have been fascinating and frightening. We might discover if they helped get life started. with all the sport, here’s Karthi at the BBC Sport Centre.

Talha Asmal is believed to be Britain’s youngest suicide bomber, joining IS after leaving the UK in March. I think the community will react with horror that someone from this community has ended up in this situation, being groomed to such an extent that they’ve taken their own lives and other people’s lives. The teenager’s family say he was radicalised over the internet, and that they are heartbroken. Also tonight: We have re-contact - the Philae comet lander has woken up and sent a message back to Earth, seven months after it lost power. Zoo animals loose on the streets of the Georgian capital Tbilisi after devastating floods - at least 12 people have died. This may well run for Wayne Rooney! And six wins out of six in England’s Euro qualifiers. Good evening. A 17-year-old who left the UK in March to fight alongside Islamic State extremists is thought to have become the youngest-known British suicide bomber. Talha Asmal, from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, blew himself up in Iraq. His family have said they’re utterly devastated, and that they believe he was radicalised online. From Baghdad, our world affairs correspondent Orla Guerin reports. Smiling before setting out to kill, this may be one of the last pictures of Talha Asmal, the A-level student turned suicide bomber. Here, he is said to be posing with three other attackers beside bomb laden cars. For his family, the whole of recognition when these images emerged on social media accounts linked to Islamic State. He is said to have carried out his attack here, near an oil refinery in northern Iraq. It has been a battle ground between the Iraqi army and Islamic State for more than a year. The teenager’s family released a powerful and poignant statement. The family, who are British Muslims, denounced the actions of Islamic State. Not and never in our name, they said. And in their hometown, Dewsbury, more condemnation from a community leader. It’s not Islam, certainly not something Islam supports. It condemns the organisation like Isis and we are hoping they would realise the mistakes they have made. Talha Asmal left home with his 17-year-old friend, Hassan Munshi, on the left. His fate is not known but experts say Islamic State is oversubscribed with suicide bombers. There is actual competition to be the person who gets to carry out the suicide operation, because of the way Islamic State indoctrinate these individuals. They believe in some cases that this is the best thing they can possibly do. Night-vision pictures appear to show Talha and his fellow bombers embracing before their mission. They were not the only ones on the move under cover of darkness. In Baghdad tonight, the security forces have released few details about a wave of suicide attacks this weekend. A spokesman told us there were 17 in all. He said police near the refinery had killed five attackers, but he said there was no confirmation of their nationality or identity. The focus here is on the fact they were killed. But in Britain, many troubling questions. How did this teenager, described as loving and affable, become a suicide bomber? And how many more may want to follow him? With me now is our home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds. How worrying will this news be for the security services here? In general, the numbers are worrying. They estimate about 700 people, extremists, have travelled to Syria and Iraq. They think about half of them have come back. Of course there is a risk there that they could mount some sort of attack here. They have no intelligence on about a third of them, which is a worry in itself. The BBC estimates at least 35, possibly 50 extremists are still in Iraq and Syria, presumably planning to take part in the activities of Islamic State there. The government stresses it is doing what it can. It stresses the new powers for passports to be seized from extremists as they return to the UK, and the huge training programme which is trying to get public sector workers to spot the signs of extremism. But it demonstrates how difficult it is to counteract a culture where people literally want to give their lives for this cause. You can be sure that the police have said very recently that this is a growing problem still. Thank you. The first spacecraft to land on a comet has renewed contact with Earth after seven months in hibernation. The Philae lander woke up this morning and briefly transmitted information, after its solar panels started generating energy as the comet got closer to the sun. Our science editor David Shukman explains. One of the most startling sights in space - the strange landscape of a comet seen from closer than ever before. Last November, a tiny lander called Philae was sent to the surface. Touching down was one of the great achievements in exploration. And the emotions at Mission Control were overwhelming. Fantastic! But then it turned out the lander had bounced into a corner that was too dark for its solar panels. Many assumed the intense cold would destroy the spacecraft, but suddenly it started communicating. A tweet from the team announced that against all the odds it was alive, and scientists are thrilled. We knew there was a chance that the strengthening sun would wake Philae up, but we didn’t know for definite. Now it is just like our little lander seems to be awake, poised and ready to do some more exciting work. This animation shows how the lander was meant to gather data on a flat surface with plenty of sunlight. It has been hibernating in a much more awkward position, but is now waking up at a really key moment. Down on the surface of the comet, the lander has actually come back to life at the most interesting possible time, just as this alien world approaches the sun, starts heating up and forming its tail. There’s suddenly more potential for discovery than anyone expected. jets of gas are blasting off the comet as the sun’s rays become stronger, and they could be carrying something remarkable, the chemical ingredients needed for life. The lander will have a ringside seat to spot them. I spoke to the European Space Agency’s Chief Science Advisor. The location where Philae is should get more active and more material come up from underneath the comet and flow past the lander. That will enable us to get an even better view of what this comet is really made of on the inside. All the time the Rosetta spacecraft has been orbitting the comet as it hurtles through space. Now the lander down on it is working again as well. So after centuries in which comets were either fascinating or even frightening, we might now discover if discover if they helped to get life started. A court in South Africa will decide tomorrow whether the Sudanese president, omaral-Bashir, should be handed over to the International Criminal Court to face charges of war crimes and genocide. An interim order prevents him from leaving South Africa, where he has been attending an African Union summit. Our correspondent Nomsa Maseko joins us from johannesburg. What is likely to happen? At the moment, it seems unlikely South Africa will be prepared to arrest omar al-Bashir and hand Africa will be prepared to arrest Omaral-Bashirand hand him overto the International criminal Court. Even though South Africa is obliged to do so, because it is a member of the ICC. So what we expect tomorrow is that South African lawyers will present -- is that South African lawyers will present-- representing the government will argue that they cannot arrest President Bashir because he is in the country at the invitation of the African union and was not invited by the South African government. This is where this diplomatic dilemma comes in, because South Africa is arguing that because the summit is happening here, it means omar al-Bashir has diplomatic immunity and cannot be arrested. That is what we expect to see in court tomorrow. One more argument is that if omar al-Bashir leaves the country before the court rules whether or not he can leave, or he should be arrested and handed over to the ICC, someone needs to be held in contempt of court. The question is who will that person be? Thank you. Spies working for British intelligence have had to be removed from some assignments after it was claimed Russia and China decoded documents stolen by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. The Sunday Times reported that agents have had to be pulled out of ""hostile countries"" after the files were accessed. Our security correspondent Gordon Corera reports. Edward Snowden fled America with countless secret files. Today, there are claims that all those files are now in Russian and Chinese hands, and that British undercover agents have had to be moved. The government refused to comment on that, instead simply restating what it’s always said. Edward Snowden has caused enormous damage to the safety and security of the West and our ability to protect our citizens from the full range of threats and risks that they face. Two years ago, Edward Snowden turned up first in Hong Kong, part of China, with the secret British and American files he’d taken. From there, he flew to Russia where he claimed asylum and where he now remains. He’s always said that while a few documents have been used for news stories, the rest are secure from foreign spies. But today, the Sunday Times claims Russian and Chinese spies have been able to break the codes and access the material. He will have been interrogated until he was blue in the face, and above all his material will have been subjected to their very best code-breakers. Over at MI6, they’re not confirming or commenting on the story in any way. My understanding is that since Edward Snowden fled two years ago, British intelligence have been working under the assumption that the Russian and Chinese might have access to all the files, and that, as a precaution, some undercover operatives have been moved. What’s being claimed today, though not confirmed by anyone in government, is that the Russians and Chinese definitely have access to all the material. Edward Snowden’s supporters have argued that he’s a whistleblower on surveillance and that governments are trying to discredit him. The US government may have called Edward Snowden a traitor, but many people in the US and all over the world think he’s a public interest whistleblower. Two years on, amid more claims, the debate over Edward Snowden’s impact shows no sign of abating. Eleanor Hawkins - the British backpackerjailed and fined in Malaysia for going topless on a mountain many locals consider to be sacred - has returned home. Reunited with her family in Derby today, she apologised for her actions. ~ Ijust want I just want to say how relieved Ijust want to say how relieved and happy!

A former South African government minister has become the first senior figure there to give credence to the FBI’s claim that a £6 million bribe was paid to secure the 2010 FIFA football World Cup. Tokyo Sexwale told the BBC the allegations were worrisome. He was speaking to our Africa correspondent, Andrew Harding - there is some flash photography at the start of his report. The 2010 Fifa World Cup... It was the moment South Africa’s dreams came true. Sepp Blatter announcing the nation had won the right to host the 2010 World Cup. But today the clouds of suspicion are growing here. Leaked letters show the government approved a $10 million payment to the Caribbean soccer boss jack Warner. The FBI insists it was a bribe in return for his vote. Warner denies that. And now a man at the heart of South Africa’s World Cup bid has made a dramatic admission. Where are the documents? Where are the invoices? Where are the badges? Where are the projects on the ground? If they are not there, you are going to leave their interpretation intact. It stinks, doesn’t it? It looks like a bribe. It’s worse. It is worse. We want to know... You were on the committee at the time. Do you not know? He denied any involvement, but urged us to look at this. South Africa’s official World Cup legacy fund supports projects like this one here and around the continent. Every penny seemingly accounted for. So why did South Africa give $10 million to support Caribbean football and not even ask how it might be spent? The question is going to be, what was done to make sure that your good intentions, you as a giver, have been realised? That’s where it is going to unravel. South Africa’s government continues to insist there was no bribe, that it can’t be blamed if it is proved jack Warner stole money sent to him in good faith. Don’t you think you owe South Africans an apology for giving it unconditionally in such a reckless manner? No, it was not reckless, they were supposed to INAUDIBLE The South African government has suggested bribery allegations could be part of a Western plot, but behind the scenes the pressure is growing, nerves are fraying here as everyone waits to find out what else the FBI knows. The World Cup meant so much to so many here, now South Africa’s reputation is on the line. The convicted paedophile Rolf Harris has been criticised by a solicitor representing his victims, after reports he wrote a letter from prison mocking them. The letter included song lyrics in which he referred to his victims as ""money-grabbing wenches"". sentenced last year to five years and nine months in prison for 12 indecent assaults on four girls. Residents of the Georgian capital Tiblisi are being warned to stay indoors after scores of dangerous animals escaped from a zoo during serious flooding. At least twelve people died in the floods which devastated much of the city. Our Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports. The floodwater raged through Tbilisi. Described by one witness as ""a hellish whirlpool"". The relentless rain began last night. Some had to swim for their lives as a local river burst its banks. But at least 12 people were drowned. TRANSLATION: These losses are very hard to tolerate. I express my condolences to everyone who has lost relatives. The dead include three staff at the city’s zoo, where the water rose right to the rooftops. Hundreds of animals were killed. But the danger didn’t subside with the floodwater. Many animals survived and are on the loose. Some were easy to spot, like this bear. And so were the hippos, these vast powerful creatures swept right to the city centre, where squares became swamps. One was captured safely with a tranquilliser, but other animals have been shot and killed. All day, rescuers have been scouring the wreckage, hunting for any people still trapped and for any more wild animals. There are lions, tigers and wolves among those still missing. So, residents have been warned to stay indoors with a hotline to call if they do spot any of the creatures on the loose. Time for the sport. Good evening. The England manager, Roy Hodgson, hailed his goal-scorers after a 3-2 win over Slovenia in their Euro2016 qualification game. Hodgson described jack Wilshere’s first two international goals as ""quality"". While Wayne Rooney is nowjust one goal away from Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time record. The victory means England have won all six of their qualifiers so far. Patrick Gearey reports. A year ago England stepped out to the jungle city of Manaus to begin their World Cup. Luciana is a very different place and England claim they are a different team. -- Ljubljana is different. His 30th goal for his country, one of his most popular. This was as awkward as the qualifying campaign has been. The ball fell to jack Wilshere. His first international goal. That swing of the boot is one moment, so Wilshere had another go. Surely a spectacular stop to the season. Plenty of time for Wayne Rooney. He had missed opportunities, but not the key one. A winning goal that moves him one behind England’s scoring record and moves his country one step nearer the finals. England’s one Day captain, Eoin Morgan, praised his young players but also their opponents, New Zealand, after the visitors beat them in the third one Day International in Southampton. The three wicket victory gives New Zealand a 2-1 series lead. Adam Wilde reports. Big hitters taking centre stage, batting is now box office. Even with those grey skies and extra sweaters, England chose to lead with their great entertainers. A sign of confidence that for a moment seemed to bold. As the sun emerged, so did the blockbuster shot that have lit UP the blockbuster shot that have lit up the summer. Ben Stokes was third to go past 50. Seemingly seeking out those gone to find an early lunch. All too soon he would join them. England all out with almost five overs remaining. A target of 303, but batting needn’t always be flashy. Today simple and effective would do. Kane Williamson controlled and measured on his way to 100. The Chase getting away from those in the field. Ross Taylor would reach three figures as well. The New Zealand batsmen doing what they had to before the inevitable big finish. Chris Froome has won the Criterium du Dauphine sending a timely warning to his competitors ahead of the Tour de France which starts in under three weeks time. Froome won today’s final stage ahead of fellow Briton Simon Yates. He also won the penultimate stage, the toughest one of the race. His last victory at the Criterium du Dauphine was in 2013, the same year that he won the Tour de France. Gordon Benson has won Britain’s first gold medal of the inaugural European games, though the event in Azerbaijan has been overshadowed by concerns over the host country’s human rights record. He took gold in the triathlon. His victory guarantees Britain a place in the 2016 olympics triathlon event. Rafael Nadal has won the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart. It’s his first Grass court title since winning Wimbledon in 2010. Nadal won in straight sets to claim the trophy for the third time and heads to London next. As well as the prize money, the 14 time grand slam champion also won a car, though he said the colour is a little too much. Before we go, let’s look at some of the main story is coming up this week. Tomorrow Michelle obama arrives in London - her two day trip will include a school visit and tea with Prince Harry. On Tuesday, inflation figures for May are published - they’re likely to show the end of a brief period of falling prices.

A man who died after a fight in Southwark on Friday night has been named as 20-year-old Tommy Blackmore from Bermondsey. He died in hospital after being found with critical injuries. Police say a number of people were involved in the disturbance which broke out on Tower Bridge Road. They’ve launched a murder investigation. Two men have been arrested. Pioneering stem cell operations to help injured athletes are being carried out at Basildon Hospital. The operations can prevent arthritis by taking stem cells from the hip and injecting them into a patient’s knees. Nikki Fox has the story. Fibre wire suture, please. 9.45 in the morning and Lucy Hudson is on the operating table in theatre. She’sjust 25 but has had problems with her knees since she was 15. She played for Tottenham, Crystal Palace and more recently Hutton Ladies, but had to quit after her knee injury got worse. I had painkillers before I played. Loads of ice gel. just woke up and couldn’t walk the next day. It would take me a whole week to be able to walk again, then I’d go and play on a Sunday. 10,000 people in Britain have cartilage damage to their knees. They include athletes like jonny Wilkinson and Luis Suarez. This procedure focuses on repairing the area protecting the bones. If cartilage is worn, bones rub against each other, causing severe pain, so stem cells from the hip are injected into the knee. This is used generally for young, active patients. There are some techniques used in other centres, but these require more than one surgery and are very expensive. 23-year-old Daniel had the surgery in April after a number of keyhole operations failed. He is already seeing a difference in how much he can bend his knee. From the age of 16, it’s been a problem. To be able to have no pain and do everyday stuff quite easily would just be amazing. This stem cell operation began in Italy, to help footballers there. It’s now being trialled in Basildon and Southampton and it’s hoped the technique could be used to prevent arthritis in other parts of the body in the future. Any early cloud tomorrow will clear during the morning to leave a much brighter, warmer day with spells of warm sunshine and a top temperature of 20 degrees. Alice Bhandhukravi will be here in Breakfast from 6am. That’s all from the late team. Goodnight. Good evening. It’s been a bit of a cool month so far, but despite the chill in the air tonight, conditions of this week will be more like they should be for mid-june. Not completely without the rain, which is most likely in northern parts, and the warmest weather comes through the middle of the week. Coldest conditions probably tonight, in fact. A lot of cloud across England and Wales. Isolated showers to the north of Scotland, but most will be dry. The clearest conditions for the Midlands into the house East Scotland -- conditions for the Midlands into the house East Scotland -- into south-east Scotland. Temperatures could get close to freezing. A chilly start on Monday but a dry one for most. Some drizzle for Kent and Sussex. Lots of sunshine through the rest of the day, with a bit of cloud building up. Sunshine further north will be a bit hazy. Some showers in Northern Ireland and western Scotland. Mostly a dry day, warmer than today, most notably in northern and eastern England. Warmer still on Tuesday. The further east you are, the sunnier it will be. Temperatures back to where they should be, if not a degree or higher. Wednesday, the warmest day, not completely dry. Some bursts of rain in northern England, southern Scotland.

Eleanor Hawkins, who’s 23 and from Derbyshire, was along with three others sentenced to three days in prison - time they’ve already served - and also fined. The judge said they had all shown remorse. Eleanor Hawkins was one of 10 backpackers who stripped - before taking photos on the peak of the mountain at the end of May. This report from Daniel Boettcher contains flash photography from the start. Surrounded by the media, Eleanor Hawkins arrived at the court, her face covered by her hair. She was led inside by police officers, she was charged alongside three other defendant, two from Canada, one from the Netherlands. In court all four pleaded guilty to a public nuisance offence. 23-year-old Eleanor Hawkins is in the middle of a gap year travelling around Asia, after graduating with a Masters in engineering. She was among a group of backpackers who removed clothes and took pictures of themselves at the top of Mount Kinabalu. The court houred that the two men who pleaded guilty, stripped naked while the two women went topless. There has been public anger at the behaviour of the group, which many consider disrespectful. Some suggested that the actions angered tribal spirits, with one official, blaming them foran tribal spirits, with one official, blaming them for an earthquake in the area six days later. But the prosecution said that the case was about upholding morals and customs of Malaysia that must be respected by everyone. Sentencing ah the four tojust under £900, and three days injail, the judge said that they had shown remorse. jennifer Pak was in court - what was the atmosphere like and how did Eleanor Hawkins seem? Some people have thought that the fact that they were detained there was so much scrutiny upon them that was already punishment enough. Not everybody was calling for them to be in prison but theyjust needed the message to be sent across. just because you come as a tourist you are not entitled to do whatever you want, even if you come from a more liberal background, the more liberal West, this is not ok in Malaysia, a more socially conservative country. And also of course deeply suspicious, if you come into our i’IOITIâS yOU ITIUSt I’âSpâCt OUT I’UlâS. Many people did think we sent across this message. jennifer Pak was in court - what was the atmosphere like and The way in which mental health services in England deal with patients in a crisis is being described as ‘completely unacceptable’ by the watchdog. The Care Quality Commission said the system was ""struggling to cope"" with people who were suicidal, having serious panic attacks or psychotic episodes. Our Social Affairs Correspondent, Michael Buchanan reports. jenny Coal has had psychiatric problems for more than a decade. One December, the 26-year-old was having suicidal thoughts and she rang a support line seeking help. I tried to explain I had been feeling bad for a while. Feeling really upset. I didn’t think I wanted to go on. I basically did not know what to do. I did not feel safe. She said just try to go to sleep and not to think about it. That was it. just hung up and I was left feeling worse than when I had rung in the first place. jenny’s night-time despair is all too common says the report. The COC describes the report for mental health patients in England as unsafe and unacceptable. Psychiatric patients told unacceptable. Psychiatric patients told the regulator that front line medics, especially in A&E lack warmth and compassion. We are a long way short of where we should be. In particular there are few parts of the country where there is true 21+ hour care, seven days a week, that is concerning for a health problem like mental health, where the crises happen out-of-hours. Good care does exist, of course, by day this clubhouse in South London helps mental health patients gain a variety of new skills. By night, it becomes a quiet sanctuary, an alternative to A&E. For many people, this is not appropriate but for some it could be the solution, peace and quiet and a chance to talk through problems with people who understand mental health. Crucially, at the end of the night they go home, they are not admitted to hospital. That can mean that they recover and move on with their lives more quickly. The approach here is innovative. No medics. Patients helping patients. We provide a caring atmosphere, a nice relaxed atmosphere. Somewhere where people can sit and talk or do whatever it is they want to do and then go home again. So they don’t have to go to A&E where sometimes things a escalated. As ministers acknowledge in their response today, however, that there is a long way to go before every mental health patient is treated compassionately. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym is in Westminster for us. Who is responsible for someone having a mental health crisis? That is a key issue. In different areas there are mental health Trusts, community health, A&E, often social care. That is the local authority. What this report is saying is that local service providers really have to wake up to the gaps which are clearly there in many parts of England. That being said, there are areas of good practice, like the one highlighted there by Michael in his report. I visited highlighted there by Michael in his report. Ivisited Lambeth report. I visited Lambeth in South London, they have a street triage scheme, with a community psychiatrist working with the police. So that is the positive, if you like. But there are many areas clearly highlighted in the report showing services certainly lacking by some degree. What is the Government’s reaction been to today’s report? Ministers are saying that mental health is a priority. They acknowledge the failings that have been shown up in the report. They say that they actually got the COC to go and look at this area, so they welcome the fact that has happened. They say more money has been pledged to mental health. That being said, under the last Government, under the coalition, the mental health care spending fell in England and some would argue a lot more is needed to get it back to where it should be. Labour have said that this is a Conservative crisis, that a lot more must be done, actions rather than words, to show that the Government really is committed to parity of esteem between mental and physical healthcare. A family friend of a woman who’s gone missing with her three year old son is appearing in court after a judge found he’d been untruthful about their disappearance. Rebecca Minnock fled her home in Somerset with her son, Ethan after a court ordered that he live with his father. Duncan Kennedy reports. He probably doesn’t know it but three-year-old Ethan Williams is at the centre of a legal and human battle. He’s been missing for more than two weeks, taken by his mother on the same morning that the custody of atan was given to his father. 35-year-old Rebecca Minnock has so far rejected the police and court pleas for her to return with Ethan and today giving yet another media interview from a secret location. I will go to court, he will be taken from me. People think I am mad for what I have done but I am realistic, I know I can’t do this forever, it is not practical. . Ethan needs his home, his own bed, his pets around him. He needs to be mixing with his friends. I know that this is not ideal. ideaL Avon ideal. Avon and Somerset police released an online video appeal for a senior officer urging Rebecca to come forward. You said you think you will be in trouble for what you have done. But I want you to know you will be safe. I want to reach a solution that is best for you both. We know you are looking after Ethan, he is safe and well but you can’t keep hiding forever, Becky. Please get in touch. We want to help you. Rebecca’s mother was at Bristol Crown Court, to hear sentencing of a close family friend. That friend, Mr Butt admitted helping Rebecca to go into hiding. The plan for her to stay away as long as possible to generate as much publicity as possible. He is sentenced for contempt of court. Roger Williams, contempt of court. RogerWilliams, Ethan’s Roger Williams, Ethan’s father says that his priority is the safe return of had is son. Two tweaks and two days on, they are still in hiding. One of the most violent clashes of the 1981+ miners’ strike happened at Orgreave near Rotherham, after trouble erupted between picketers and police officers. Today, over 30 years later, the body that investigates the police - the Independent Police Complaints Commission - says it won’t open an inquiry into the police handling of the affair. The IPCC spent two years looking into claims that officers used excessive force against miners, manipulated statements and gave false evidence in court. Here’s our correspondent Danjohnson. 1981+, on a field outside of Sheffield. Thousands of picketing miners and police officers, fighting for control of the road into the Orgreaves coal works. A sudden eruption of violence that saw injuries on both sides. By the end of the day, 95 miners had been arrested. Arthur was one of them. There was an injured miner. I crouched down to offer assistance. I was truncheoned on the back of the head. He stale bears the scars and carries resentment about what happened. I do believe there should be a public inquiry. I can’t believe it has taken 31 years to reach this stage. But for the police to be allowed to get away with it, it beggars belief. Arthur and many others were charged with riot but in court there were questions about the police evidence. Hundreds of statements were shown to contain exactly the same phrases and at least one had a forged signature. The case was thrown out. There was no miscarriage ofjustice but no-one’s been held accountable and now the Independent Police Complaints commission says it will not be launching a fresh investigation. Do you think that the miners have had justice, they should pipe down and go away? I think, as I said, I think it is very difficult applying, trying to wind back time. There is absolutely no doubt, if we were looking at it now, if this happened now, the IPCC, with our strength and powers and expert years, I think would do a betterjob than the Police Complaints Authority. As that was not set up in the way that we were. But we can’t do that. You know, we can’t go back. So, there is not anything that I can do about that. The campaigners are disappointed, so is South Yorkshire’s elected Police Commissioner. We greeted it here with dismay and disbelief. They have had two-and-a-half years to do something, they decided to do nothing. The reasons that they have given could have been given two-and-a-half years ago, frankly. Orgreaves was a defining moment in the miners’ strike and in the policing of industrial disputes. It tore communities apart. Mel Whiles was a Chief Inspector, had been a miner. It way mayhem on the miner’ side and on the side of the police. Some of the behaviour on both sides was very, very bad. So you would support an inquiry? I would. I have nothing to fear. Some may have, I don’t. Is it the right thing, though? With the time and the money? With what is happening in the country now, no, it will not. Many cannot forget what happened here. It is hard to move on. They say that they will campaign for what they calljustice and that will continue. Daniel Sandford is here with me. Where does this now leaf the calls for an investigation? The Independent Police Complaints commission have spent more than two years digging up a lot of paperwork. In that paperwork they found evidence that the police may have committed perjury, that they may have fabricated statements, that they may have committed serious assaults. That was not dealt with at the time. So given the amount of work done by the IPCC, they feel it is a very good start if there were a public inquiry or something like the Hillsborough independent panel. But in although there are similarities with the hill borough in terms of the behaviour of the police and the concerns of senior police officers in the South Yorkshire Police at the time, there are differences too. Nobody was convicted as a result of the perjury. Nobody went to prison, there was no miscarriage ofjustice. Nobody died in the battle of Orgreaves 30 Nobody died in the battle of Org reaves 30 years Orgreaves 30 years ago. So it may be that despite the calls from the national union of miners, from the local Police Commissioner and from the Labour Party for an inquiry on an independent panel to be set up, it may be as the consequences were not that serious, that the Home Secretary will be able to resist them.

The funeral of the former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy is taking place this lunchtime, near his home in the Scottish Highlands. Family, friends and leading political figures are attending the service near Fort William. Mr Kennedy died last week after suffering a haemorrhage as a result of his battle with alcoholism. He was 55, and had been an MP for 32 years. Our Scotland correspondent Laura Bicker is there. This very special funeral Mass is just ending here. You can probably hear the Piper behind me. The hearse isjust about to hear the Piper behind me. The hearse is just about to leave the church, the church where he used to attend most Sundays whenever he could, by his parents used to play every weekend. In the last few minutes we have heard from his best friend, Ryan McBride, who gave the eulogy. He said Charles Kennedy was one of us, he felt like one of us. He has a special place in the hearts of people here and right across the UK. He will be remembered as a giant of British politics but Charles Kennedy’s heart lay here, in the Highlands. In this village near his home and at his local church, family and friends gathered to say farewell, including former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. A difficult day for his family and ex-wife, Sarah. His office staff in Fort William are also missing him. In Lochaber we know Charles for his great sense of compassion. He helped so many people. That is how I want to remember him. Charles Kennedy grew up in a crofters cottage near Fort William. His parents played in church every weekend and he said he could not imagine a day without music. He is remembered here as a humble man. When Charles’s parents died and Charles said a few words here in the church, he would not come up here to the lectern but he insisted on speaking outside the sanctuary from the floor. In this church, Charles was one of the backbenchers. A shock election result saw Charles Kennedy elected as an MP in 1983. He was just 23, the youngest in the Commons at the time. In 1999, he was elected Leader of the Liberal Democrats, helping the party win a record 62 seats in 2005. There were signs all was not well. He had to resign less than a year later after admitting a problem with alcohol, a battle he would fight for the rest of his life. But still he ensured his voice was heard, most notably with his opposition to the Iraq War. He was here to serve. Every challenge was not about him. A hugely sensitive man in private, no ego at all. He never put himself first. But today gathered beneath a mountain Charles Kennedy loved but never climbed, those who loved him came to remember the Highland man, the family man, notjust the statesman. ~ I think you can see behind me, Charles Kennedy’s the year is being led and hiked from this church, the church where he spent so much time both as a boy and a man. This is Charles Kennedy’s finaljourney. After this special mass service, the family will have some private time. They will head off into the hills several miles from here to the family burial plot, where Charles Banerjee will-- Charles Kennedy will be buried alongside his father and mother. Certainly it would be in amongst the scenery that he loved. I think one of the special things you can see here is you can almost see why he loved the place. The mountain behind, Ben Nevis. One of the many stories people loved about Charles Kennedy, he looked at the mountain every single time he was here that he never actually climbed it. He preferred instead to read a book. That was the measure of a quiet man, a humble man, and that is what we have been hearing about today. This has been a special service where people right across Fort William and politicians right across the political divide have come here to PGY political divide have come here to pay their final respects. And for the family as well. We have heard about him being a family man. A difficult time for a ten-year-old boy to lose his father. For many people across the UK, Charles Kennedy has been a memberfor the past week as a politician who was never scared -- past week as a politician who was never scared -- has been remembered for the past week as a politician who was never scared. He was always himself, whether it is a speech about the Iraq War or whether he was standing in church saying something about a friend. It was always about himself. Today is a farewell to Charles Kennedy. There will be another service at Glasgow University, a special place in Charles Kennedy’s heart, next week. The hunt for two escaped murderers in New York State is now in its sixth day. The search is concentrating on woods close to the maximum security prison they broke out of last Saturday. Roadblocks have been set up around the area and schools have been closed. Our Washington correspondent Gary O’Donoghue reports. Day six in the manhunt for the two escaped killers goes on in Upstate New York. First police thought they had gone to Canada, then Vermont, now the search is focussing three miles east of the prison itself. Police dogs are reported to have picked up the scent of the two men in a wooded area, where they may have spent a night since their escape. Food wrappers are said to have been found at the scene. Highway 371+ was closed in the town of Platsberg and residents in the immediate area, were told to stay indoors. The searches, I think they are necessary. It’s for the safety of the public, to reapprehend these individuals that are a threat to society. Four schools in Saranac Central District cancelled classes, meaning 1,500 children had to stay home for the day. The investigation also continues to focus on this woman, joyce Mitchell, who worked at the prison and may have befriended the two men. Some reports suggest she was meant to drive the getaway car but she hasn’t been arrested or charged. Sweat and Matt were both jailed for life. They used power tools to bore through a wall and crawled up a pipe to freedom last Saturday, after what police say were months of planning. Meanwhile, the mother of one of the two men, David Sweat, appealed for him to give himself up. I love you and get back where you belong before you get hurt. Give up. Find someone that he can trust that will take him back to the prison and get him back in. Up to 500 law enforcement officers were involved in the search along with helicopters and the dogs. We are strongly asking the public to remain vigil and support anything suspicious, anything with regards to vehicle larcenies, burglaries, trespass, any sign of any of that. We need to know about it. Today has seen the first real break in the investigation for the police while the two men are still on the run. The danger to the public is very real. The former head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has been found not guilty of procuring prostitutes for parties in France and the United States. Our correspondent Lucy Williamson is in Lille. Lucy,it Lucy, it seems the prosecution eventually accepted they did not have enough evidence to secure a conviction. That is right. The chief judge said opinion had been divided among the sex workers who had given evidence against Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Some thought he knew about their profession and some said he did not. Dominique Strauss-Kahn never paid them himself, said the judge. He had acted more like the client and had not necessarily been aware. There was not enough evidence to convicted him on the charge of aggravated pimping. The state prosecutor had advised the judges to acquit him for lack of evidence. Legaljudgment is only one part of Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s troubles. The moraljudgments that followed The moral judgments that followed him The moraljudgments that followed him will probably stick more closely and he will have to really decide now where he goes after this spectacular fall from grace we have seen over the past few years. Network Rail is to be investigated after falling behind on its multi-billion pound plan to improve infrastructure - causing more delays for passengers. The regulator, the Office of Road and Rail, says the company is failing to ensure enough reliable punctual trains on some of its busiest commuter routes. Our correspondent Andy Moore reports. Commuters flooding into London this morning on one of the services singled out for poor punctuality. It is generally all right but the crowding is worse. There is not enough carriages. I have to say it is reliable. There has been a significant decline and people are disgruntled about it. It has been a tough year for many rail travellers. At London Bridge station, passengers jumped over barriers or crawled under them. jumped over barriers or crawled underthem. Overrunning repairworks under them. Overrunning repair works just underthem. Overrunning repairworks just after Christmas outside London’s King Cross led to big queues at other stations. In its defence, Network Rail says it is struggling to meet the scale of the challenge after years of underinvestment. It says the number of people travelling by train has doubled in the past 20 years and there are a million more trains on the network than a decade ago. Network Rail get some praise in the report but there is also criticism of particular projects, four example works to upgrade the signals around Cardiff will finish 17 months later than planned. The project to electrify lines between Liverpool and Manchester finished about a month late. Fairly recently we heard that millions of pounds were being put in to ensure the infrastructure in the network was fit for purpose. It was interesting to hear some of that work is now being delayed and not on schedule. Overall, train punctuality is 3% below target. The Government says performance have to improve. Time for a look at the weather. Pretty volatile out there, I think. We have seen temperatures build up over the last few days. It is set to change. As often happens with the British summer, we start to see boundary showers to break it all down. That will happen later today. -- thundery showers. In the northern parts of the UK, we can see where the rain has been so far. There are showers across northern France drifting northwards. The remnants of those are in the south of England. The south of England. We showers +>Âp+ÂiÂ9 The south of England. We showers pvppiw up The south of England. We showers popping up elsewhere. Temperatures will rise through the afternoon and onwards into the early evening. The temperatures are enough to set off the heavy thundery showers. More particular in the west of London. In the south-west of England they could merge to give longer spells of rainfall time to time. They will creep northwards into Wales. In the southeastern most counties of England it will be warm and humid. Once you get North, Manchester for example, another fine afternoon. In the North West of Scotland it is very much on the cool side. That air will be starting to push south with the later on tonight and into the start of the weekend. This evening and into the early part of the night, we will see the risk of torrential downpours. More particularly across the southern part of England and Wales. As the night wears on the rain will emerge anywhere up through Wales, across northern England and into parts of the Midlands. That is where it will stick for most parts of Saturday. A fine day and a bit of sunshine coming through in the south. To the north there will be patchy rain across Scotland and Northern Ireland and a drop in temperature. Some parts of Scotland and northern England could be 10 degrees cooler than we are seeing today. In the south, still reasonably warm. Having got the rain out of the way through this evening and overnight, for the Isle of Wight festival through the weekend, it looks to be set fair. Into Sunday a bit of rain around here and there, particularly in the central part of England. A bit of sunshine breaking through. Pretty much everywhere you will notice a cooler feel to the weather. Looking into next week a cooler start. A lot of dry weather to come, increasing amounts of sunshine. As a result, it will steadily warm up next week. Even through the rest ofjune there is a chance of things staying relatively dry. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime... ",,

While Australia pays another country to take its migrants - rare footage of the conditions inside the migrant camps. And the D-Day veterans, the prince, the painters and their portraits. Tonight on BBC London: Network Rail is to be investigated after failing passengers with ongoing delays and disruption. And a new mayor for Tower Hamlets, two months after Lutfur Rahman was removed for electoral fraud. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. The British student who posed topless with other tourists on top of Malaysia’s highest mountain has been freed from jail and is due to return to the UK. Although 23-year-old Eleanor Hawkins and three other Westerners were sentenced to three days in prison, the court ordered they be released because of the time they had already spent behind bars, and ordered them to pay a fine. Their prank had caused local outrage because the mountain is considered sacred by local tribes. jennifer Pak’s report contains flash photography from the start. They came to Malaysia for a holiday but ended up as criminals. The world’s media jostled for a glimpse of the four tourists accused of public indecency. Among them was Eleanor Hawkins from Derby. She arrived at the majestic peak of Mount Kinabalu with ten other Western tourists at the end of May. Only she and three others were charged. The court says the foreigners challenged each other to strip, to see who could withstand the cold while taking pictures. The defence lawyer says Eleanor, seen here hiding herface in the maroon shirt, and the other three, brought shame and ridicule upon themselves and their native countries. They received three days injail, backdated to Tuesday, and a fine. Today, her family gave this reaction back home in Derby. We think the sentence is appropriate and fair for the offence committed. I’m grateful the Malaysian authorities reached this decision. Eleanor knows what she did was wrong and disrespectful and she is deeply sorry for any offence she’s caused to the Malaysian people. But here at a public memorial for the victims, some Malaysians do believe the nude tourists and the earthquake are related. I didn’t think it was funny. Quite disrespectful. Quite odd that they have the guts to do so, knowing it is a sacred place for the locals. Many indigenous groups believe that their souls rest here at Mount Kinabalu when they die. The judge in the case said the tourists committed a foolish act, but because all four of them pleaded guilty, to save the prosecution and court time, was an vacation of their remorse. Eleanor Hawkins will soon be heading home but the authorities are still looking for six others involved in the mountain incident. jennifer Pak, BBC News. The mother of a woman who’s gone missing with her three-year-old son has beenjailed this evening, along with her boyfriend, after he helped Rebecca Minnock go into hiding and then lied about it to the police. Ms Minnock fled her home in Somerset with her son, Ethan, after a court ordered that he live with his father. Duncan Kennedy is outside Bristol Crown court, What more can you tell us? Well, certainly dramatic developments in Bristol today as a result of this case. No sign yet of Rebecca and three-year-old Ethan, although they told the Daily Mail today that Ethan was safe. The developments have been in the court behind me. In the past few minutes, Rebecca’s mother, Louise, and a close family friend have been jailed for contempt of court. Louise has been given ten days in jail, for contempt of court. Louise has been given ten days injail, and her friend 28 days in jail. Both of them, thejudge said, lied to friend 28 days in jail. Both of them, the judge said, lied to the court and hampered the police investigation in the search for Rebecca and Ethan. Two we e ks Two weeks and three days and still no sign of three-year-old Ethan Williams. His mother took him into hiding over a custody battle and today called the media to say she knew she could not stay on the run forever. People probably think I am mad for what I have done but I am Barry Roux in this stick. And I can’t do this than ever, it is not practical. -- can’t do this than ever, it is not practical. -- I am very realistic. He needs his home, his own bed, he needs to be mixing with his friends. Rebecca Minnock was last seen in public at this shopping centre in Somerset at the end of May. We now know she had help escaping from a family friend called Andrew pot. He told Bristol Crown Court that he had not seen either Rebecca or Ethan in the two weeks since. He said he was extremely sorry for lying to the court earlier and said he now urged Rebecca to come forward. He was jailed for 28 days for contempt, whilst Rebecca’s mother, Louise, was jailed for ten days, both because they had lied to the court about what they knew of Rebecca and Ethan. Earlier, a new plea was made by police in an online video, appealing to Rebecca’s instincts as a mother. You are his mum and thinking what is best for him and doing what any mum would, but you can’t keep on hiding forever. Roger Williams, would, but you can’t keep on hiding forever. RogerWilliams, Ethan’s forever. Roger Williams, Ethan’s father, forever. RogerWilliams, Ethan’s father, has said he just wants his son back safely. Tonight, Ethan is still almost certainly unaware of the legal and human battles whirling around him. Concerns are growing in Greece tonight about how to cope with thousands of migrants arriving by boat from countries across the Middle East and beyond. Many are in desperate need, without food, shelter or medicines. At least 48,000 have arrived in Greece by sea this year, more than six times the number during the same period last year. Many are arriving in some of the Mediterranean’s most popular tourist resorts, among them Lesbos, just a few miles from Turkey. From there, Paul Wood sent this report. A cross-section of global conflict on the quayside in Lesbos. Syrians and Somalis, Afghans and Iraqis. 5000 came to this Greek island in April, 7000 in May. Even higher numbers are expected here this month and the month after. This is one fraction of the huge movement of people that is the epic story of our time. They have risked everything in pursuit of a better life. The island is idyllic, but the waters around it dangerous. Every morning a British resident, Eric Kempson, waits for the boats and tries to help. Last Wednesday was a bad one. It really was. He has witnessed people drowning out here. The thing is about the last three boats, especially the last boat, it is mainly women and children. Sorry. Europe, at last. Some were smuggled thousands of miles overland before they reached the sea. They were packed into tiny boats and left to pilot them alone. They were shaking with fear as they stepped onto land. But it’s a good day for the refugees, and a lucrative one for the people smugglers. Each of these people has paid $1000 for the last five miles of the journey through European water, across the water from Turkey. That’s up to $40,000 per boat. With those kind of immense profits for the smugglers who are sending many boats per day, it is almost impossible for the Greek authorities to stop. Sheer relief. Now they are off to start their new life. First, though, already exhausted, they have to walk 40 miles over the mountains to the refugee centre. There is no official help for them until they register. But they are glad to do it. They can’t quite believe they’ve made it. It’s very dangerous. Please do not play with your life. People may say to you, ""It’s very easy"" and all that. I’ve been through it. It’s not easy. Trust me. It’s not worth paying that money. That’s all I have to say. The refugees will leave for Germany, Sweden, Britain, if they are able to. Some on Lesbos offered help, they say. Others, abuse. The island is bitterly divided over whether to welcome them or turn them away. That’s the question for the rest of Europe, too. PaulWood, BBC News, Greece. Well, as the Mediterranean migrant crisis shows no sign of easing, the Australian government says Europe should learn from its policy of turning all migrant boats away and paying for them to be looked after elsewhere. They set off from some of Asia’s poorest countries, including Bangladesh, Indonesia and Myanmar. The Australian navy intercepts them at sea and takes them to Papua New Guinea to be processed. And that is where they stay. They never make it to Australia. Our correspondent jon Donnison sent this report from Manus Island in the north of Papua New Guinea. It contains some distressing images. Head by boat to Australia, end up in Papua New Guinea. We are trying to reach Australia’s notorious offshore Manus Island detention camp, home to around 1000 asylum seekers. This is a place in Australia does not want the world to see, dubbed by some the Guantanamo of the Pacific. You can see the camp there on the beach. This is about as close as we dare get because it’s pretty heavily guarded. It looks pretty calm, but it’s been an entirely different story inside. Over the past year, Manus has been at boiling point. It’s impossible to film inside, but these pictures were smuggled out on mobile phones. Frustrated asylum seekers, locked up seemingly indefinitely. Hundreds have been on hunger strike. Some stitched their lips together. This man, we were told, swallowed razor blades. We managed to get a local to sneak our camera past Australian officials and reach the camp. Asylum seekers, locked up here for almost two years. People are scared to talk but we spoke to one Middle Eastern man who spent 18 months in detention before being moved to B ITIOFE OpâI’I pI’iSOI’I OI’I MBFIUS. My situation in detention was very, very, very terrible. We were living in one room, two metres squared. Four people. It is unfair. The Australian government broke the majority of our human rights. Five years ago, hundreds were drowning trying to reach Australia. But tough policies, intercepting boats, have seen the number attempting the journey drop to virtually zero. And today Australia refused to deny reports that it had even paid people smugglers if they agreed to turn their boats back. Papua New Guinea is poor, but Australia gave the government over £200 million, not only to house the detention centre, but also to resettle refugees. And Australia has repeatedly said that Europe should follow its lead. There is a lesson for other countries in how to do the right thing by everyone, do the right thing by our people, and ultimately do the right thing by poor, misguided people who, for all sorts of reasons want a better life, but who very often end up dead, if they succumb to the lure of the people smugglers. Australia’s message is simple. Asylum seekers looking for new lives in Sydney or Melbourne, no matter how desperate, will find themselves stuck in places like Mannus. Cruel to be kind, orjust cruel? jon Donnison, BBC News, on Manus Island. Our top story this evening: The British student who posed topless on a sacred mountain in Malaysia is freed from prison and due to return home. ~ Iam in I am in Cardiff, where Later on BBC London: Could these be the answer to cleaning up London’s air? 3,000 electric hire cars are coming to the capital. This is what happened to a kids’ football coach when he asked a parent to calm down. Now the club’s decided to tackle violent parents. Mental health services in England are often ""completely unacceptable"" for people in crisis. That’s the view of the health service watchdog, the Care Quality Commission. It found that in many cases the police offer better help than hospital staff, and that problems affect large numbers of patients. Nearly half a million people are registered with a GP for a serious mental illness, with nearly three million registered for depression. Our health editor Hugh Pym has more details. Deary me. At times, they can enjoy the sunshine and life in the countryside, but for Amy Evans, nothing can take away the memories of her mother Fiona’s mental health crisis a year ago. Fiona has a history of depression. Things got so bad they were sent to A&E and had to wait 14 hours there. Amy recorded some of her mother’s breakdown and they gave us permission to hear it. INAUDIBLE SOBBING Sometimes I feel it’s me. It is me that’s got the problem, but I don’t think there is an answer. If she was sitting there with a broken leg and was making such noise and in so much pain physically, she would have been seen within a couple of hours, I am sure. But because it is a mental pain, they haven’t got the right people, haven’t got the right staff, it’s not our fault. Someone is coming. I heard every excuse under the sun. The report by the Care Quality Commission found that some aspects of emergency care are unsafe and unacceptable for patients in England with mental health problems. It said the system could fail to meet needs and a survey found just 35% of patients said they received the help they needed in A&E. It holds a mirror up so we can see the experiences people are having. Sometimes until you are shown that, you don’t realise you have to change. We have seen that now, we know we have to change and we are putting in place the wherewithal to make those changes happen. The report does highlight areas where there is said to be good practice, including here in the London Borough of Lambeth. Mental health patients in crisis, it said, are treated in a timely manner with a joined up approach by local care services. The South London and Maudsley Trust runs a scheme where psychiatrists work closely with police. There is also a clubhouse where mental health patients can learn new skills in a safe environment. But Amy and Fiona’s experience shows just how varied the care of patients in crisis can be. For them, the system failed and they are worried it could happen again. A brief look at some of the day’s other other news stories. A 14-year-old boy has been charged with attempting to murder a teacher in a school in Bradford. The teenager was arrested after supply teacher Vincent Uzomah was stabbed during a lesson at Dixons Kings Academy in Bradford yesterday morning. The teenager is to appear in court tomorrow. The Government’s fast-track appeal system for asylum seekers has been declared unlawful by the High Court. The process, which has been in place for a decade, was applied to more than 4000 migrants last year. Ministers say they are ""disappointed"" by the ruling and will appeal. Family, friends and leading political figures attended the funeral of the former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy near his home in the Scottish Highlands. Mr Kennedy died last week after suffering a haemorrhage as a result of his battle with alcoholism. He was 55 and had been an MP for 32 years. The clashes at the Orgreave coking plant in Rotherham in 1984 were a defining moment of the miners’ strike. But after two years looking into claims of alleged police misconduct, such as excessive use of force and giving false evidence in court, the police watchdog, the IPCC, says there will be no formal inquiry. The TUC has called it a bad day for civil liberties in Britain. Danny Savage is in Orgreave this evening. Danny, this has caused a lot of controversy. Yes, controversial because of the wider picture. The mimes have often thought this was an orchestrated showdown between them and the police. -- showdown between them and the police. -- the mimes. Today’s ruling came about after a BBC investigation looked into the police’s behaviour and the statements made afterwards. But it has been decided that no further action is to be taken. Forever remembered as the Battle of Orgreave, this is where 5000 police clashed with 10,000 miners outside a coking plant in South Yorkshire in 1984. The miners wanted to stop lorries coming and going, the police were tasked with keeping the site open. Politically, this is what Margaret Thatcher described as the enemy within, fighting with the law. 30 years on, some have neither forgotten nor forgiven. It was like a medieval battle except only one side had the armour and the horses, and we had nowt. Only did they outnumber us, but they had impunity and that was the only word for it, to dish out whatever treatment they was necessary. But that is not how some police officers remember it. It was mayhem, on both sides, the behaviour was very, very bad. More than 90 miners were arrested, but a criminal trial collapsed because of poor police evidence and they were freed. The coking plant is long gone, as are most of the police officers, who it was ruled today cannot be disciplined because they have retired. The passage of time means that what happened here is being taken no further. We have probably reached a point where there is a public enquiry or we choose to move on, and get on and put it behind us. But that didn’t wash with the miners of 1984 at a meeting today. I want some revenge for losing my career, and more than anything else, for my community being destroyed. They now hope for a public enquiry, but is there a big enough momentum for that? It seems unlikely. Nobody died here and ultimately there was no miscarriage ofjustice in the courts. Tonight, Wales could take a huge step towards qualifying for their first major football tournament since the 1958 World Cup. They take on Belgium in Cardiff in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Our sport correspondent Natalie Pirks is there for us now. Natalie, could this be Wales’ moment tonight? Well, just over an hour until we find out. What is being billed as Wales’ biggest match in more than a decade. Currently second behind Belgium in qualifying, and the fans know that tonight they could take a huge step towards being able to dance in the streets of France next summer, and they are daring to dream. The Welsh never need an excuse to sing. Use feed me till I want no more... These are glorious times for Welsh football. Very confident. The lads have done everyone proud. I think we can go and win tonight, definitely. Ah, the optimism. It has not always been that way. Wales’ first trip to a major tournament was 1958. It was also their last. Since then, it has been a case of so near yet so far. But today, the Welsh have plenty of reasons to smile, not least because of Gareth Bale, the world’s most expensive footballer, set to win his 50th cap tonight. The Belgians are in fine form themselves, having risen rapidly to the number two ranked side in the world. Not that Wales’ manager is bothered. There is no fear in our camp. Anticipation, no fear. Belgium is next, whoever is after that, we want to qualify. The Welsh FA has pulled out all the stops to make tonight special. Cardiff city Stadium has been transformed. The team’s motto is front and centre. The nation believes. Wales is falling in love with football all over again. The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to the character of the D-Day veterans. He says their spirit has been captured in 12 portraits of men who fought in the campaign. He was talking at the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace where the portraits went on public display. They are in their 90s and getting a little frail, but 71 years ago they were young soldiers involved in one of the most significant military operations of the Second World War, D-Day. The landings which led to the liberation of Europe. In tribute to what they and their colleagues did, 12 D-Day veterans have had their pictures painted by some of Britain’s leading portrait artists. The work has taken a number of months. Today in the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace, the Prince of Wales, whose idea it was too commissioned paintings, the veterans to view the pictures and to hear their memories. In 1944, to view the pictures and to hear their memories. In1944, Eric johnson, in the centre, was part of a tank crew fighting in Normandy. He lost many friends. Ifeel we a tank crew fighting in Normandy. He lost many friends. I feel we are representing so many of us. It was a brilliant idea. That history should be remembered. Prince Charles told me the idea to commission the paintings had occurred to him when he attended the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy last year. It suddenly struck me, of course, that they were getting so old, we were down to a very few. Probably wouldn’t see many again. I suddenly thought it would be so wonderful to try and capture these wonderful old boysin try and capture these wonderful old boys in paint. They literally went through hell for us. They are absolutely fantastic, particularly with absolutely fantastic, particularly with their berries and their medals. Meeting the veterans and seeing the portraits struck a particular chord for the Duchess of Cornwall, whose late father fought in the war. They are all my father’s age. He died eight years ago. He had that same spirit. They never complained. They just got on with it. They didn’t whinge, a stiff upper lip. They were British. The indomitable spirit of the D-Day veterans, captured on canvas 71 years on. Time for a look at the weather, with Sarah Keith Lucas. Are we heading for a nice weekend? It is very mixed. It has been a very warm day. This picture from the Holme Valley with some rather warm looking alpacas. Temperatures up to 26.8 Celsius at Kew Gardens. The warm weather has been building over the past couple of days but it will come to an abrupt end. Some thundery showers, the radar shows persistent rain in the South West. In the English Channel, some heavy showers and rumbles of thunder, lightning and hail. The downpours make their way further inland, across many southern counties. More persistent rain across the south of Wales and the south-west of England, likely to be torrential downpours and surface water tonight. To the north, a bit quieter. For most of us, double figures overnight. Through tomorrow, a mixed day. All sorts of weather. Persistent rain through the central slice of the country. To the north, a few showers. Persistent rain for Scotland, nothing heavy. Northern Ireland, bright and dry. Much fresher, temperatures in Aberdeen only 10 degrees. We could see 22 Celsius towards the south-east. Tomorrow, Trooping the Colour at Horse Guards Parade to mark the Queen’sofficial birthday. It should stay dry in London, 19-20. A bit more sunshine come the afternoon. Sunday, most of us starting with a lot of cloud. Some brighter skies breaking through. Temperature-wise, 11-21. brighter skies breaking through. Temperature-wise, 11-21 . After tonight’s heavy rain and storms, much of the week will have some dry weather on the cards. Our main story, the British student who posed topless on a sacred mountain in Malaysia has been freed from prison and is due to return home. That is all from the BBC Tonight on BBC London News: Network Rail is to be investigated after failing passengers with ongoing delays and disruption. Four or five months ago, it was an absolute breeze and there was room for everybody. So there has been a significant decline and people are pretty disgruntled about it. It’s the crowding that is worst. There are just not enough carriages for everyone. A new mayor for Tower Hamlets. But investigations continue after the last man in power lost his job for electoral fraud. The primary school has written to parents telling them its pupils are not allowed to fast. But some parents say it is for them to decide. ~ I have always liked fish and chips. And Samuel Ljackson tells us two good reasons why he keeps coming back to London. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Victoria Hollins. Network Rail is to be investigated over huge numbers of late trains and unreliable services on some of London’s busiest commuter routes. Tens of thousands of passengers have endured months of awfuljourneys - especially those using Thameslink, caused by a massive rebuilding programme at London Bridge. On Southern services, track and signalling failures have created good deal of disruption too. Here’s our transport correspondent, Tom Edwards. It has been a tough year for some of the capital’s commuters, particularly those who accuse Thameslink and Southern. Work at London Bridge by Network Rail has cause destruction and that has meant commuters are sometimes taken drastic action to get to their trades. My train is always the late, there is always some sort of signalling problem. The overcrowding at the moment is really ridiculous and many people, later on in their lives, simply are not getting on. There are always late and always overcrowded. The target is for 92% of trains to arrive on time. On some lines it has improved, but on Thameslink only 85% of trains arrived on time and Southern was even worse at 83%. An investigation is now trying to find out if Network Rail has done everything it can to reduce the impact its work has on operators. It is really important that if that are more delays, more disruption, that passengers are kept well informed so we can plan our journeys to enable asked to make informed decisions if there is destruction. Network Rail says it is working hard to improve after decades of under investment. London Bridge is being rebuilt, but it is not are that there are problems 7% of all track replacement is delayed and 63% of signalling upgrades and 77% of overhead power lines are behind schedule. In front of the committee this week Network Rail admitted there may still be problems ahead. If I could predict when the next asset is going to feel I can assure you I would fix it. We are developing London Bridge and we will be vulnerable, but we have better control than we did. The concern for commuters will be there are still many years to go off Network Rail trying to balance upgrades with providing a reliable service. This performance of Network Rail could feasibly leads to fines, but the real pressure is political. The Transport Secretary has said that performance must improve, the industry has to work together to address the failings and that needs start now. ",,

Lots more to come including: The red car revolution coming to the capital’s streets. How a fleet of pay-as-you-go hire cars are hoping to clean up the air in London. Tower Hamlets has a new mayor- two months after the previous one, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office. Rahman was found guilty of electoral fraud in April. The new man in charge is Labour’sjohn Biggs, who says the borough now needs to move forward from its recent controversies. There’s flash photography in this report from our political correspondent, Karl Mercer. Handshakes and applause for the winner. Only this was two hours before Labour’sjohn Biggs was officially declared as the new mayor of Tower Hamlets. Are you confident? I think I might be in the top one. His confidence wasn’t misplaced, as he ran out the winner by nearly 6,000. Watching on the woman he beat, Rabina Khan, who had been part of the administration of disgraced former mayor Lutfur Rahman. He was kicked out of office for election fraud, clearing the way for a new leader in Tower Hamlets. ~ I think it is fundamental in the first year at least that you have to go out across the community and top to people and understand the challenges and rebuild the way that the council makes decisions. All this sort of stuff is about building confidence. Yesterday’s election saw police officers at every polling station, with no-go zones for canvassers marked out on the street to prevent intimidation of voters. ~ I would be proud to deliver a number of initiatives... For Rabina Khan, a consolation speech. For Andy Erlam, one of four people who took the case to court that saw Lutfur Rahman kicked out, a sense of victory, even though he wasn’t on the winning side at the election. Labour won Labourwon fairand Labour won fair and square. If it was as a result of my work my work was to bring democracy back and I think that has been achieved. Questions still remain over future police investigations at Tower Hamlets, though, and the borough is also being partly run by four commissioners appointed by central Government. There are still many challenges ahead because although olive branches have been put out there must be pleased inquiries into what went on in the last five years cause we need to clear out the stables. There are massive challenges for a like this around houses -- There are massive challenges for a like this around houses -- posting. I am keen to focus on these issues UP I am keen to focus on these issues up and down the country. Despite the smiles in the early hours of this morning, john Biggs will know that tough times may lie ahead in Tower Hamlets. Detectives investigating the murder of a teenager who was stabbed in Islington have released an image of two suspects on a moped. 18-year-old Stefan Appleton was attacked by two youths in a park on Wednesday night. Both escaped on the moped down Nightingale Road. Police are appealing for witnesses. A primary school trust has been criticised for banning Muslim pupils from fasting during Ramadan. Barclay Primary School in Leyton, in east London, sent a letter to parents saying children shouldn’t be deprived of sustenance and water. But some Muslim groups say it’s for parents to decide what’s best for their children - not the school. Alice Bhandhukravi is in Leyton now. The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on Thursday, during which time many Muslims will be fascinating. There are some exemptions of who is to go without food and water, including pregnant women, old people, and young children. Traditionally it was parents who decided whether their children went without food and water during Ramadan, but now this school is one of four that have taken it upon themselves to set a rule. The school has written to parents saying that since the school policy and Islamic law have the same purpose, ie to safeguard the health and education of the child, the policy of the primary school and others than the trust is not allowed any children attending the school is too fast. They have said that parents can get permission for their children too fast expressly from the headmaster. I spoke to appeared earlier about her reaction to this letter. I think it is a parents’ decision to make whether their children should be fasting or not because it is each addition, something we have been doing for many years, so it is not ideal to be told this by anyone. What other reaction has been? The Muslim Association of Britain has said that they think the school should have taken an advisory role and not acted on and not acted in an authoritative manner. They have not read a comment two us this evening. -- made a comment to ask this evening. Every football season there are thousands of charges of misconduct for behaviour off the pitch. But it’s not just top end football clubs where there’s a problem. One club in Dartford - where a coach was repeatedly punched in front of his children - is so concerned by the way some parents behave it’s employed a member of staff at every match to monitor behaviour. Tarah Welsh reports. They call it the beautiful game, but even at the children’s’ match things can turn ugly. At a fixture for under nines in man was repeatedly punched because he asked a parent from the opposite team to stop telling his son to hurt other people. Children were in tears. All mY people. Children were in tears. All my children were there at the time and they were in tears. People were trying to help. It was a really awful state of affairs. This man was found guilty of attacking Stewart and is given a 12 month suspended sentence. The cover says that most parents are well behaved but with every match now there is a dedicated person there to make sure. Most people just get overexcited but this is working well because people feel safer that there is someone there who can step in and said that it is not acceptable behaviour. Sunday football is huge and parents and children come to take part but this is not the first time there has been an incident. Last season the FDA issued 15,700 penalties for a range of incidents off the pitch, but they said that should be put in the context of 113,000 teams playing 1.2 million matches across all football. Every wiki does this, screaming and shouting at the referee. -- Every wiki does this, screaming and shouting at the referee. -- every week. This advert was introduced to discourage aggressive behaviour. The government body says the campaign seems to be working as the number of incidents is falling. We invest about a quarter of £1 million into respect every year. We have made a sustained investment over the last six seasons and into the next season. Quarter of the millions is not a lot of money considering how much money goes a different ball, is it? The numbers that are mentioned are Premier League funds not FA funds. However, the message has not yet got through to everyone. Still to come tonight: The Empire strikes back returns to the UK box office 35 years after it was first in cinemas. I will tell you why later. And Samuel Ljackson struts his stuff with celebrity friends, all on a mission to fight cancer. It was billed as an electric car revolution - and started six years ago when Borisjohnson promised 100,000 electric cars and 25,000 charging points across London. Well, that target may have long been abandoned, but today a new scheme was launched to encourage Londoners to go electric. It’ll work like the cycle hire scheme, but, as Marc Ashdown explains, not everyone is convinced the capital can cope. They are the red card revolution that hoped to turn London Green. These are pay-as-you-go electric cars that are environmentally friendly and they work like the cycle scheme. You register and then pick one up and fought by pounds for half an hour away you go. This thing is quite good to drive, but anyone who has had an electric car in London will tell you it is a frustrating experience. This needs to be charged up and there are 1500 charging points around London, but they are temperamental and it is like pulling teeth. At any time two thirds of them could be out of action. However, it has worked well in Paris and many people have signed up. The company behind it is planning to pick significant money into it to persuade Londoners. Everyone realises that pollution is bad for your lungs and bad for health. We have launched in three other big cities in the world where we have been able to offer the service and ensure the London people will be happy. What do you think they have to do to convince people? People will have to see that like a bicycle when you need one you can get one and to forever and you are going and be able to park it. If you have parking facilities it would be great. I think a lot of people will go for it. Cars are quite expensive and this has been popular with young people in Paris. It would be better if they were green. The mayor scrapped his original target of 100,000 cars and another operator says that investment is needed before the city can cope. The infrastructure in London has held electric vehicles back for schemes like this. We the partners we are working with the ball work together to make sure the charging infrastructure improves. The first cars taking the road at the end of the year. It will be up to Londoners they succeed. -- if they succeed. Secret Cinema has grown from a tiny cult following to one of London’s biggest entertainment events. They show classic films - but enhance the audience’s experience by using actors to recreate famous scenes, often on a grand scale. Last year they staged Back to the Future, but had a launch which was little short of disastrous. So how will they fare, taking on one of the biggest film franchises of all time? Wendy Hurrell is at Secret Cinema, finding out. There is sand underfoot. I am in an area where everything is on offer. This year the Secret Cinema is doing the Empire strikes Back. They have largely filmed back into the top ten for the first sciences at Lazard 35 years ago. That is a contrast to the event last summer where the first week had to be cancelled for babies reasons. Over here is the founder of this. You didn’t crawl into a hole after last year and said that you weren’t going to do it again. This year appears to be even more ambitious. We managed to get 5000 people to come last time. I took a long time to get the rights for this film and we’re now doing Star Wars. The price has gone up this year and some people are saying that £75 for a ticket plus a booking charge is a lot of money. What would you say to that? Reboot every single penny into creating the best fan experience possible for the audience. We want to create a world where the audience and the performance blower and it is very complicated. This is the biggest event you could imagine. It is the biggest film and the biggest franchise. Where do you go from here? We have done about 1+5 different films, all different types of films. I am interested in doing large spectacles, but at the same time also doing smaller films. We are doing independent films this year as well. I’m interested in the concept of reimagining how you go to the movies. Thank you forjoining asked. It is like being in the movie here. There have been some top people working on this and there are things I am not allowed to tell you about. Thank you. Now it’s time for the sport. Here’s Chris Slegg. Thanks, Victoria. We’ll start with football and with Arsenal who have been charged by the Football Association with allegedly breaching regulations over the signing of defender Calum Chambers last summer. Arsenal paid Southampton around £16 million to bring the 20-year-old to north London. The FA claims the club broke rules regarding the use of agents. Arsenal have released a statement in which they say they ""acted in good ""faith throughout the transfer"". They have 14 days to decide whether to appeal against the charge. At the Women’s World Cup in Canada, England will be looking for their first win of the tournament tomorrow evening against Mexico. England lost their opening match against France on Tuesday. They’ll be favourites tomorrow but Chelsea striker Eniola Aluko believes Mexico do pose a threat. ~ I have played with some of those players in the Mexican team and I know what they are about. It is not going to be an easy game and every World Cup game is going to pose a different threat, but I think we are ready and we are confident we can win the game. UK Athletics says its review into the doping allegations surrounding Mo Farah’s coach Alberto Salazar will report back in August. The review was set up after the BBC’s Panorama programme accused Salazar of administering banned substances to another athlete. Salazar denies the claims. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Farah. The first ever European Games began in Azerbaijan this morning. It’s a mini Olympicsjust for Europe. There’s been controversy over the choice of Baku as host city and criticism as to whether another sporting event of this scale is needed. For the athletes, though, it’s a chance to shine. Emma jones met some of the Londoners competing. joeljoyce is already a Commonwealth Games medallist, so Baku is about adding another gold to his collection.

A new elite training Centre hasjust been opened here, which is a perfect place for this woman to hold her skills. These games are a small step for her towards bigger things. games are a small step for her towards biggerthings. It towards bigger things. It is a real honour to be on the team and it is exciting to see what it is like at major championships that are run by the Olympic Association. For me it is going to be unlike anything I have done before and I am looking forward to it. British woman’s water poll has lost all its funding since the London 2012 Olympics, so for the team representing Team GB in Baku it is about putting the sport back in the spotlight. I love the game and I want to make it a high profile sport. I want to get people involved and make people excited about it. Someone medals, somewhat experience and recognition. They will be a part of the first-ever European games. Good luck to all of them. Better news today regarding Former England, Tottenham and Chelsea strikerjimmy Greaves. The 75-year-old has left hospital just over a month after suffering a stroke. Greaves was admitted to intensive care on the 3rd of May. Friends say his condition has "" improved considerably but that there is still a very long way to go"". Greaves will spend the next few weeks in a rehabilitation unit. That’s all from me, Victoria. He’s a busy Hollywood star whose work commitments mean that he has to spend a lot of time in the capital. But now Samuel Ljackson has used his charm and status to support a London-based charity promoting cancer awareness for men. Our entertainment correspondent, Brenda Emmanus, caught up with him to talk charity, film work and fish and chips! On screen and off Samuel has come to epitomise cool. Now he is using his charming for a good cause. He is a global ambassador for a charity based in London that will tonight present a celebrity fashion show, similar to this one last year. When you see cancer to a man he just thinks lung cancer. They do not realise they can get breast cancer. They do not realise that more men are diagnosed with cancer in the UK, but more men die from it. They want to find a way to get men to realise that they need to have more checkups and they need to talk to each other at the way that women talk to each other about cancer. I have trouble understanding you people sometimes. Is it true that during your time spent in London and the UK you have developed a love for fish and chips and London fashion? I have always liked fish and chips and I have always liked fashion. It is an interesting place. I started coming here in 1980 and at that time I realised there is a sense of individual style here that I don’t find in a lot of different places when I travel.

The ball that kicks off men’s Fashion Week is this event and then it will continue for a month. The idea is to get men the information they need to tackle cancer head-on. Now, the weather with Peter Gibbs. Today was the warmest day of the year. However, with heat and humidity often comes rain. This may happen later this evening. We have a severe weather warning in force this evening and overnight. There will be rain west of London. Here come the thunderstorms into Kent and East Sussex. They are moving towards the capital.

Eleanor Hawkins pleaded guilty to a public nuisance offence and was sentenced to three days in prison, which she’s already served. Concerns are growing in Greece tonight about how to cope with thousands of migrants arriving by boat from countries across the Middle East. Many are in desperate need, without food, shelter or medicines. Meanwhile, the Australian government says Europe should learn Network Rail is to be investigated over huge numbers of late trains on some of London’s busiest commuter routes. Tens of thousands of passengers have endured months of disrupted journeys caused by a massive rebuilding programme at London Bridge.

(IN ALEX’S VOICE) And Alexjones. Tonight’s guest is a comedian who’s turned lip syncing - the art of moving your lips so it’s looks like you’re saying someone else’s words - into a global phenomenon. It’s genius! Please welcome the man with the nasty pants, Stephen Merchant! Thank you. Well, Stephen. Loving the moves. I thought this was a family show, I’m surprised you could show that! It’s pretty punchy. Not as raw as Christina’s. It was good, though. That was your performance on hit US TV show Lip Sync Battle, which you co-created. Where did the idea come from? Why do you think people love I’ve done a number of things over the years like The Office and I’m known for one stupid thing I did once. I know how Oj Simpson feels. People forget he was a sportsman and an actor! You get involved in one double homicide murder trial... an actor! You get involved in one double homicide murdertrial... ! Yes, I was driving along with a couple of friends of mine, a married couple, and we were lip syncing in the car to songs on the radio. And john was talking about being on a talk show in the US and I said, we should do this. He came up with the idea of a contest, a rap style battle. People love it, I’m obsessed with it, we watch it online. Such is important idea. One of those things. It’s because it’s so simple. If you see Robbie Williams on stage you know you can’t do that but if you are singing in the shower, miming to him, you can do that. It seems very easy and everyone has probably done a vision of it. Not even as difficult as karaoke. I think it probably has an appeal. Inspired by the show, Patrick and I ",,

In Greece, six times more migrants than last year are reaching their shores. For some, Europe is not the sanctuary they hoped for. I,v e I’ve been through it, it’s not easy, trust me.

And a new Mayorfor Tower Hamlets two months after let fur Rahman was removed for electoral fraud. Good evening. As Europe tries to find a way to stop the increasing number of migrants risking their lives to get here, we have two sides of the story tonight - the holiday islands of Greece struggling to cope with the people who wash up on their beaches, and the hardline approach of Australia, which has effectively outsourced its migrant problem to another country. So far this year 105,000 migrants have arrived in Europe. Nearly 2,000 are known to have died or gone missing. At least 48,000 have arrived in Greece by sea this year, more than six times the number during the same period last year. Right now 2,500 people are waiting on the island to be processed. From there our correspondent, Paul Wood, sent this report. A cross section of global conflict on the quayside in Lesbos. Syrians and Somalis, Afghans and Iraqis. 5,000 came to this Greek island in April, 7,000 in May. Even higher numbers are expected here this month and the month after. This is one fraction of a huge movement of people that is the epic story of our time. They have risked everything in pursuit of a better life. The island is idyllic but the waters around it dangerous. Every morning a British resident, Eric concern sob, waits Every morning a British resident, Eric Kempson, waits for the boats and tries to help. Last Wednesday was a bad one, it really was. He’s witnessed people drowning out here. The thing is about the last three boats, and especially the last boat, it is mainly women and children. Sorry. Europe at last. Some were smuggled thousands of miles over land before they reached the sea. They were packed into tiny boats and left to pilot them alone. They were shaking with fear as they stepped on to land. But it’s a good day for the refugees and a lucrative one for the people smugglers. Each of these people has paid $1,000 for the last five miles of the journey into European water, across the water from Turkey. That’s $50,000 to $40,000 a boat. With those kind of immense profits for the smugglers, who are sending many boats a day, it is almost impossible for the Greek authorities to stop. Sheer relief. Now they’re off to start their new life. First though already exhausted they have to walk Ao miles over the mountains to the Refugee Centre. There’s no official help for them until they register. But they’re glad to do it. They can’t quite believe they’ve made it. It is very dangerous, please do not play with your life. People may say to you it’s very easy and all that. I’ve been through it and it is not easy, trust me. It’s not worth paying that money. That’s all I have to say. The refugees will leave for Germany, Sweden, Britain if they are able to. Some on Lesbos offered help, they say. Others abuse. The island is bitterly divided over whether to welcome them or turn them away. That’s the question for the rest of Europe too. In Australia, the Government’s solution is to intercept migrants who arrive by boat and send them to another country, which it pays to take them in. The Australian Prime Minister says it’s a tactic Europe could learn from. The migrants come from some of Asia’s poorest countries, including Bangladesh, Indonesia and Myanmar. The Australian Navy sends them to Papua New Guinea in the Pacific, where they live in a holding camp. There have been recent allegations of violence and mistreatment. And that’s where they stay. They never get to Australia. Our correspondent, jon Donnison, sent this report from Manus Island. Head by boat to Australia, end up in Papua New Guinea. We’re trying to reach Australia’s notorious offshore Manus island detention camp, home to around 1,000 asylum seekers. This is the place Australia does not want the world to see. Dubbed by some the Guantanamo of the Pacific. You can see the camp there on the beach. This is about as close as we dare get, because it is pretty heavily guarded. It looks pretty calm but it’s been an entirely different story inside. Over the past year Manus has been at boiling point. It is impossible to film inside, but these pictures were smuggled out on mobile phones. Frustrated asylum seekers locked um, seemingly indefinitely. Hundreds have been on hunger strike. Some stitched their lips together. This man, we were told, swallowed razor blades. We managed to get a local to sneak our camera past Australian officials and reach the camp. Asylum seekers locked up here for almost two years. People are scared to talk, but we spoke to one Middle Eastern man who spent 18 months in detention before being moved to a more open prison on Manus. My situation in detention was very, very, very terrible. We were living in one room two metres squared. Four people. It is unfair. The Australian Government broke the majority of our human rights. Five years ago hundreds were drowning trying to reach Australia. But tough policies intercepting boats have seen the number attempting the journey drop to virtually zero. Today Australia refused to deny reports that it had even paid people smugglers if they agreed to turn their boats back. Papua New Guinea is poor, but Australia gave t Government over £200 million, not only to house the detention centre but also to resettle refugees. And Australia has repeatedly said Europe should follow its lead. There’s a lesson for other countries in how to do the right thing by everyone. Do the right thing by our people, and ultimately do the right thing by poor misguided people who for all sorts of reasons want a better life, but who very often end up dead. If they succumb to the lure of the people smugglers. E people smugglers. Australia’s message is simple - smugglers. Australia’s message is simple - asylum seekers looking for new lives in Sydney or Melbourne, no matter how desperate, will find themselves stuck in places like Manus. Cruelto themselves stuck in places like Manus. Cruel to be kind, themselves stuck in places like Manus. Cruelto be kind, orjust cruel? The mother who’s been missing with her three-year-old son for more than two weeks has told a national newspaper she’ll hand herself in to police. Rebecca Minnock said she’d made the decision after both her mother and a family friend were jailed for contempt for lying about her disappearance. She said her son Ethan needs to return to his friends and his routine. Duncan Kennedy’s report contains flash photography from the start. The first words and the first site of Rebecca Minnock and her son Ethan in 17 days. Three-year-old Ethan looks happy and sounds well. The interview with the Daily Mail takes place at an unknown location. Rebecca Minnock said she was preparing to hand herself in to the police. What’s made my mind up is Ethan’s been asking to see my family. He wants to go back to his own bed at home. I’ve seen the amount of support I’ve had from neighbours, family and friends and I’m just hoping that somebody will be able to help us to get this case looked into again. Rebecca Minnock said she hadn’t planned to go into hiding, it was a spur of the moment decision on the day she was supposed to hand Ethan over after losing a cost ky battle. It was a huge decision and I did feel trapped at the time. I looked at my son on that morning and didn’t hand him over. I just felt that was all I could do at the time was run away with him. It was the end of May Rebecca Minnock took Ethan into hiding. There’ve been repeated calls for her to come back, including one from the judge in the case, who said Ethan’s relationship with both parents was important. Today Rebecca’s mother, Louise and her former partner, Andrew Butt, were jailed for lying to the court. But lawyers said they simply wanted her and Ethan to come home. We’ve made our point, we’ve got our support. Come home. Tonight Rebecca Minnock said she hoped the legal system will be sympathetic to her. I’m not sure whether they would like to make an example of me for going against the court order, but I’m hoping and praying they’ve seen the support I’ve had from various people and they know I’m a good mum and they will possibly relook into this case and look at all of the facts. There’s been no response yet from Roger Williams, facts. There’s been no response yet from RogerWilliams, Ethan’s from Roger Williams, Ethan’s father, but it is known he’s been under enormous stress. Tonight it seems Ethan and his mother are well but still with many questions over their future. The Daily Mail is reporting that Rebecca has handed herself into police but we have not had confirmation of that. It is not clear what will happen to Rebecca Minnock. It is assumed Ethan will be reunited with his father. It is not clear whether the Father knows about the sequence of events tonight, but this whole extraordinary drama does now appear to be coming to an end. The British student who posed topless with other tourists on top of Malaysia’s highest mountain has been fined and is due to return to the UK. Although 23-year-old Eleanor Hawkins and three other Westerners were given a short jail sentence, the court ordered they be released because of the time they had already spent behind bars. Their prank had caused local outrage because the mountain is considered sacred by local tribes. jennifer Pak’s report contains flash photography. They came to Malaysia for a holiday but ended up as criminals. The world’s media jostled for a glimpse of the four tourists accused of public indecency. Among them was Eleanor Hawkins from Derby. She arrived at the majestic peak of Mount Kinabalu with nine other Western tourists at the end of May. Only she and three others were charged. The court says the foreigners challenged each other to strip, to see who could withstand the cold while taking pictures. The defence lawyer says Eleanor, seen here hiding herface in the maroon shirt, and the other three, brought shame and ridicule upon themselves and their native countries. They received three days injail, backdated to Tuesday, and a fine. Today, her family gave this reaction back home in Derby. We think the sentence is appropriate and fair for the offence committed. I’m grateful the Malaysian authorities reached this decision. Eleanor knows what she did was wrong and disrespectful and she is deeply sorry for any offence she’s caused to the Malaysian people. An earthquake struck days after the naked stunt. Some Malaysians do believe the nude tourists and the earthquake are related. Quite in awe that they have the guts to do so, knowing it is a sacred place for the locals. Many indigenous groups believe that their souls rest here at Mount Kinabalu when they die. The judge in the case said the tourists committed a foolish act, but because all four of them pleaded guilty, to save the prosecution and court time, was an indication of their remorse. It’s not known if Eleanor Hawkins is still being held tonight, but her lawyers say she will soon be heading home soon. The authorities are still looking for six others involved in the mountain incident. jennifer Pak, BBC News. Mental health services in England are often ""completely unacceptable"" for people in crisis. That’s the view of the health service watchdog, the Care Quality Commission. It found that in many cases the police offer better help than hospital staff and that problems affect large numbers of patients. Nearly 500,000 people are registered with a GP for a serious mental illness, with nearly 3 million registered for depression. Hugh Pym has more details. Deary me. At times, they can enjoy the sunshine and life in the countryside, but for Amy Evans, nothing can take away the memories of her mother Fiona’s mental health crisis a year ago. Fiona has a history of depression. Things got so bad they were sent to A&E and had to wait 14 hours there. Amy recorded some of her mother’s breakdown and they gave us permission to hear it. INCOHERENT SOBBING I feel let down. Sometimes I feel it’s me. It is me that’s got the problem, but I don’t think there is an answer. If she was sitting there with a broken leg and was making such noise and in so much pain physically, she would have been seen within a couple of hours, I am sure. But because it is a mental pain, they haven’t got the right people, haven’t got the right staff, it’s not our fault. Someone is coming. I heard every excuse under the sun. The report by the Care Quality Commission found that some aspects of emergency care are unsafe and unacceptable for patients in England with mental health problems. It said the system could fail to meet needs and a survey found just 35% of patients said they received the help they needed in A&E. It holds a mirror up so we can see the experiences people are having. Sometimes until you are shown that, you don’t realise you have to change. We have seen that now, we know we have to change and we are putting in place the wherewithal to make those changes happen. The report does highlight areas where there is said to be good practice, including here in the London Borough of Lambeth. Mental health patients in crisis, it said, are treated in a timely manner with a joined up approach by local care services. The South London and Maudsley Trust runs a scheme where psychiatrists work closely with police. There is also a clubhouse where mental health patients can learn new skills in a safe environment. But Amy and Fiona’s experience shows just how varied the care of patients in crisis can be. For them, the system failed and they are worried it could happen again. Hugh Pym, BBC News. The funeral of the former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has taken place near his home in the Highlands. Family, friends, Nick Clegg and other leading political figures attended the service. Mr Kennedy died last week after suffering a haemorrhage as a result of his battle with alcoholism. He was 55 and had been an MP for 32 years. Mo Farah’s coach, Alberto Salazar, is facing fresh questions tonight about the nature of his relationship with an Olympic athlete who failed a drug test in 1996. Farah said on Saturday that Salazar told him he wasn’t coaching the American runner Mary Slaney when she tested positive for a performance enhancing drug. But the BBC has uncovered interviews suggesting they were still working together at the time. Alberto Salazar is subject to wider allegations relating to the use of banned substances, specifically that he doped Olympian Galen Rupp in 2002. Salazar and Rupp deny the allegations. There is no suggestion of any wrong doing by Mo Farah. Andy Swiss reports. In the hills above Portland, Alberto Salazar is keeping a low profile. At his house, the blinds drawn, his family declining to comment. I don’t think any of us have any comment. But Salazar is preparing to have his say, against claims he was involved in doping with his athlete Galen Rupp, claims they both deny. Salazar is also coach to Mo Farah, but there is no suggestion Farah has broken any rules. The allegations against Salazar came from some of his ex-athletes and staff, but another former colleague, coach Bob Williams, gave me a different view. Is he a man who you think would break the rules? No, he would not. Did you see him give anyone drugs? No, never. Did you see him break any doping rules? No, ever. Is he a man you would trust implicitly? Absolutely, and his athletes do trust him. This is where Alberto Salazar trains his athletes here in Portland and where he has built his reputation as one of sport’s most successful coaches. He says his accusers have knowingly made false statements, but now more questions are emerging about his past. Most notably, was he the coach of the American runner Mary Slaney when she failed a drugs test in 1996? Last weekend, Mo Farah said he had been assured he wasn’t. That’s a serious question and that’s a question I asked before, and Alberto said no, he wasn’t coaching her at the time she failed a drugs test. But some pictures and quotes at the time suggest Salazar was coaching Slaney. Today Slaney said she still disputed the tests and the findings but didn’t clarify her relationship with Salazar. It all raises more uncertainty, and even here in Oregon, where he used to compete, support for Salazar is wavering. If it turns out there is some real hard evidence it is clearly damaging to the sport, but at this point there isn’t. And I choose to believe in Alberto, rather than his accusers. How confident are you that he hasn’t done anything wrong? I don’t know. I suspect he probably has, let’s face it. Salazar insists that’s not the case, but his hopes of clearing his name and his reputation face yet another obstacle. Andy Swiss, BBC News, Portland. Wales have taken a giant step towards qualifying for their first major tournament since 1958. Tonight they beat Belgium, ranked the second best team in the world, 1-0, to go top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group. Natalie Pirks was watching the game for us. They have come close before but not since 1958 have the terraces reverberated to the music of the valleys at a major tournament. It was Belgium who stood in the way of their drive towards next summer’s euros. The sense of occasion was tangible. Billed as the biggest game in more than a decade, calm heads were called for, and who better than Gareth Bale to pounce on a moment of defensive madness. The take, turning, the shot, a fitting way to celebrate his 50th appearance in the national shirt. Tales were up, the atmosphere was electric and Belgium were starting to panic. Wales new Belgium would come at them in the 2nd half, but in truth, the red Devils were rather tame, as the heavens opened. Gareth Bale departed, but the volume only increased. Wales edged closer. Spirit, plus talent, plus confidence has made for an irresistible combination here. Wales are on top of the group and they feel on top of the world. All day the fans have been telling me how confident they were, and tonight, Wales rewarded that belief. While Belgium were largely anonymous, the Welsh stars rose to the occasion. Keep this up and the Welsh fans will have to dust off the passports for a trip to France next summer. In the meantime, Cardiff will be pretty lively tonight. The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to the veterans of D-Day. Prince Charles said their ""indomitable spirit"" had been captured in 12 portraits he commissioned of men who fought in the campaign. He was talking to Nicholas Witchell at Oueen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace, where the portraits have gone on public display. They are in their 90s and getting a little frail, but 71 years ago they were young soldiers involved in one of the most significant military operations of the Second World War, D-Day. The landings which led to the liberation of Europe. In tribute to what they and their colleagues did, 12 D-Day veterans have had their pictures painted by some of Britain’s leading portrait artists. The work has taken a number of months. Today in the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace, the Prince of Wales, whose idea it was to commission the paintings, joined the veterans to view the pictures and to hear their memories. In 1944, Ericjohnson, in the centre, was part of a tank crew fighting in Normandy. He lost a good many friends. I feel we are representing so many of us. It was a brilliant idea. History should be remembered. Prince Charles told me the idea to commission the paintings had occurred to him when he attended the 70th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy last year. It suddenly struck me, of course, that they were getting so old, we were down to a very few. We probably wouldn’t see many again. I suddenly thought it would be so wonderful to try and capture these wonderful old boys in paint. They literally went through hell for us. They are absolutely fantastic, particularly with their berets on and their medals. Meeting the veterans and seeing the portraits struck a particular chord for the Duchess of Cornwall, whose late father fought in the war. They are all my father’s age. He died eight years ago. But he had that same spirit. They never complained. Theyjust got on with it. They didn’t whinge, a stiff upper lip. ",,

That’s all from us. On BBC Two now Newsnight examines the case of the American black rights activist whose parents say she is white. Now, time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Victoria Hollins. Network Rail is to be investigated over huge numbers of late trains and unreliable services on some of London’s busiest commuter routes. Tens of thousands of passengers have endured months of dreadfuljourneys, especially those using Thameslink, caused by a massive rebuilding programme at London Bridge. On Southern services, track and signalling failures have created a good deal of disruption too. Here’s our transport correspondent, Tom Edwards. It has been a tough year for some of the capital’s commuters, particularly those that use Thameslink and Southern. Work at London Bridge by Network Rail has caused disruption, and that’s meant commuters sometimes taking drastic action to get to their trains. My service is always delayed. There’s always something or another happening, some sort of signalling problem. The overcrowding on the trains at the moment is really ridiculous. Many people later on in the line as you come towards town simply aren’t getting on. They are always late and when they do come they are overcrowded. The Rail Regulators target is for 92% of trains to arrive on time. On some lines it has improved but on Thameslinkjust 85% of trains arrived on time, and Southern was even worse, at 83%. An investigation’s trying to find out if Network Rail has done all it can to reduce the impact it’s work has on operators. It is really important now that if there are more delays, more disruption, that passengers are kept very well informed, so that we can plan ourjourneys to enable us to make informed decisions if there is disruption. Network Rail says it is working hard to improve following decades of underinvestment. London Bridge is being rebuilt, but it’s notjust there where Bridge is being rebuilt, but it’s not just there where there are problems. In the renewal programme 7% of all track replacement is delayed, as well as 63% of signalling upgrades, and 7% of overhead power lines are behind schedule. In front of the committee this week Network Rail admitted there could still be problems ahead. We are trying to prevent things from failing. If I could predict when the next asset would fail I would fix it. Wherever we are developing London Bridge we are always going to have a vulnerability, but we are in much better control now. The concern for commuters will be there are still many years to go of Network Rail trying to balance upgrades with providing a reliable service. A primary school trust has been criticised for banning Muslim pupils from fasting during Ramadan. Barclay Primary School, in Leyton in east London, sent a letter to parents saying children shouldn’t be deprived of sustenance and water. But some Muslim groups say it’s for parents to decide what’s best for their children - not the school. ~ I think Ithink in trying to act from the best welfare for children. However, we feel the way it has been dealt with, which is enforcing that children should not fast, is probably seen as more like an authoritarian type of way when rather they should have probably approached a more supportive and advisory role with the parents. Tower Hamlets has a new Mayor, two months after the previous one, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office. Rahman was found guilty of electoral fraud in April. The new man in charge is Labour’sjohn Biggs, who says the borough now needs to move forward from its recent controversies. There’s flash photography in this report from our Political Correspondent Karl Mercer. Hand-shakes and applause for the winner, only this was two hours before Labour’sjohn Biggs was officially declared as new Mayor of Tower Hamlets. Are you confident? I think you might be in the top one. His confidence wasn’t misplaced as he ran out the winner by nearly 6,000 votes. Watching on the woman he beat, Rabina Khan. Lutfur Rahman was kicked out of office for election fraud. It is fundamental that in the first year one has to go out into the community, meet people, talk to people, understand the challenges and rebuild the way the council reaches decisions. It is about building confidence. Yesterday’s election saw police officers at every polling station. No-go zones for canvassers marked on the street to prevent intimidation of voters. I will be proud to deliver a number of progressive left initiative which is should have been delivered many years back. A consolation speech. For Andy Earlham a sense of victory. Labour won, fair and square. If it was a result of my work, my work was to bring back democracy to Tower Hamlets. That’s been achieved. Questions still remain over future police investigations at Tower Hamlets, and the borough is also being partly run by four commissioners sent in by central Government. There are many challenges ahead, because although olive branches were put out, there must be police inquiries and full investigation into what actually went on in the last five years. We need the clean the stables out. There are massive challenges for areas like this around jobs and housing, and I’m really keen that we focus on the issues that matter to people here in the East End and up and down the country as well. Despite the smiles, john Biggs will know that tough times may lie ahead in Tower Hamlets. That’s it for now from me, but let’s find out what the weather’s up to with Phil Avery. ~ I was left in charge of the washing on the line and a daughter’s Tea Party to organise in the garden. This warning goes through until 9 o’clock tomorrow. Yes, there’s still the spotlight of the odd thunderstorm. Not everybody seeing those. And things gradually easing down for the south of oury.

News forthe weekend, the rain for the weekend, the rain is too close to call to the north of us. The lightning could be further south.

A family of a six-month-old boy claim his ashes were never returned by Enfield crematorium. And up close to London’s digital innovations, as London Technology Week kicks off. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. People in Dewsbury have been speaking of their shock after a teenager from the town was reported to have carried out a suicide bombing in Iraq for Islamic State. 17-year-old Talha Asmal is believed to be Britain’s youngest suicide bomber. He’s thought to have carried out an attack on an oil refinery in the north of the country on Saturday. His family say he was groomed online, and described it as a ""tragedy."" This report is from our correspondent Danny Savage. Ta hla Tahla Asmal, a 17-year-old, who should still be at school in Yorkshire. Instead, it is believed, he was briefed this weekend on how to carry out a suicide bombing in Iraq. A mission he went on to complete with three others, killing at least 11 people. The crude bomb is in the passenger seat next to him here. At his family home in Dewsbury, mourners came and went today. They are heartbroken and say the naive teenager was groomed over the internet. I have talked to one sixth form who knew him for years. He simply does not believe he was groomed anonymously on the internet. He thinks somebody close to him, in his life, in his community here, pushed him in the direction of IS. If that is true, say locals, the community would have done something about it. If there is somebody like that, we would like to know who it is. I am certain if we found out there was somebody who was planting these sorts of ideas into the minds of young people, converting them into terrorist activity, we would want to into terrorist activity, we would wa nt to confront want to confront them and challenge them. An ITV documentary tonight looks at this very issue. just how our young British Muslims convinced to die for IS? This man should know, he used to do it. join them into conversations on Twitter or Facebook, all the social media available. He might have had a strong or keen sense of how to bring aboutjustice or fight for the about justice or fight for the oppressed. He aboutjustice or fight for the oppressed. He might have had his head turned by Hassan, seen on the left, who he travelled to Syria with. Also from Dewsbury, his brother wasjailed for with. Also from Dewsbury, his brother was jailed for terror offences. Mosque leaders said they are doing everything they can to discourage teenagers from joining IS. You may neverfind out before discourage teenagers from joining IS. You may never find out before a person leaves this country, or their parents would not let them go, none of the members of the community or anyone, would let them go and cross the borders. Whatever the wise and wherefores, West Yorkshire family has been left in turmoil. How could the son of a peace loving family kill himself at the age of 17 and murder others? Our correspondent, Orla Guerin, is in Baghdad. Despite all the warnings, the lure of Islamic State still seems to be strong for some young people from the West. Yes. The evidence is that young people are continuing to be recruited. That is a matter of concern for Muslim community leaders and the security services. Estimates are that around 700 Britons have gone to the battlefields in Iraq and Syria, about half of them are thought to have returned home. As many as 30 are believed to have been killed fighting. If this track attributed to Tahla Asmal is confirmed, it is thought he would be the sixth Britons who have carried out a suicide bombing. The counterterrorism think tank has spoken of waiting list of willing suicide bombers, of a queue of young people who are competing for the opportunity to carry out this kind of attack. His family have spoken about how they believe he was recruited, in a very calculated and sophisticated way, over the internet. We knowjihadi groups have used the web as an effective recruiting tool. Any confirmation from authorities in Baghdad that it was Talha Asmal? Nothing further on that. We have spoken this morning to a senior security official. He says he is aware of media reports that has no information at this time. Worth remembering the authorities here are dealing with a steady stream of foreign fighters an ending series of suicide bombings. The Iraqi Prime Minister has said 1+0 foreign suicide bombers are entering this country every month. That gives a sense of the scale of the problem they are facing. The reality is the authorities may have to focus on where the next bomb is coming from Rather than working at the nationality or some of the previous ones. -- bomber. And in Kenya, a British man is thought to be among 11 fighters from the militant group Al Shabab to have been killed after an attack on a military base. Thomas Evans, who was 25 and from Buckinghamshire, converted to Islam, changed his name to Abdul Hakim, and told his family three years ago that he had joined the Islamist group. Let’s join our correspondent, Karen Allen, who’s in Nairobi. Karen, what more can you tell us about what happened? Forensics teams are expected to identify one of two white attackers who are killed in the attack as being Thomas Evans, an ordinary man from Bucks. Up until the age of 19, he converted to Islam. In 2012, hejoined Al Shabab. The attack we have been talking about happened yesterday, about 56 kilometres away from a popular holiday destination. It was a small village with an attack on a military base. There was a firefight in which two Kenyan soldiers died, 11 militants were also killed. What do we know more about him? We do know that his mother was very critical of the British anti-terrorist police. In 2011 they stopped her son from travelling to Kenya. He was on a watchlist after he declared he wanted to join an Islamist group. watchlist after he declared he wanted tojoin an Islamist group. He subsequently was able to go to Esvpfs subsequently was able to go to Egypt’s and then, in 2012, declared to his mother he had joined Al Shabab. We are expecting final confirmation in the next few hours. The family have said they want their privacy and are awaiting confirmation. They have asked for privacy at this difficult time. The Hillsborough inquests have been hearing evidence about two teenage girls who died in the football disaster in 1989. 19-year-old Sarah and her 15-year-old sister Victoria Hicks were among the 96 people who were killed at the FA Cup semi-final in April. judith Moritz is in Warrington. Yes, you will know the start of this process was to hear evidence about the Hillsborough disaster as a whole. These inquests have turned a corner into hearing individual evidence about each of the 96 people who died at Hillsborough. This week it is the turn of teenagers Sarah and Victoria Hicks. We heard that the parents would like Victoria to be referred to as the key. The girl 's parents have become very well-known. They have spent many years campaigning for the rights of the families bereaved at Hillsborough. As they arrived at court, I asked them how they were feeling, given that these are the second set of inquest to happen, 25 years after the first and there is so much more information available to them now. I would have to bring a carfull of... A wheel barrow, probably, to bring the files to court. An awful lot of preparation by the lawyers and everybody else. We are dealing with probably 20 times the facts we have had before. I can deal all day with the accountability issues and every other issue but then it comes to personal stuff and it is very difficult. The court has been shown a range of material, video footage and photographs, including CCTV footage, black and white footage, of the family as they arrived at the Hillsborough ground. They were annotated so the jury could see where they were. Painstaking work has gone into looking at all of this footage so it can be analysed. The court also saw graphic footage of the girls inside the pens of the terraces. Too graphic to show on television. We heard from witnesses who came to the court today, who talked about what they saw of the girls, how Vicky fell unconscious at one point and her sister, Sarah, tried to pull her up. We heard the description of how Sarah was crying, asking people to help. One man tried to pull Sarah out of the crowd but lost his grip. We heard that Sarah Hicks had a look of total terror on herface. These inquests will continue. Forthe herface. These inquests will continue. For the Hicks parents it will take a few days. We’re hoping to hear evidence from them as part of this process. Planning officers in Lancashire have recommended that energy firm Cuadrilla should be allowed to carry out the controversial process of fracking at one site in the county. If final approval is given by councillors next week, it will be the first since a ban on the process was lifted in 2012. But the proposal for drilling at a second site has been rejected. Our Industry Correspondent, john Moylan, is in Preston for us now. Yes, we are about five miles from Blackpool. If you look behind me, in the distance, this is the location planning have recommended fracking tank officials -- planning have recommended fracking tank officials -- planning officials have recommended fracking can take place. They have recommended one refusal and a pass on Preston. This news was met by stunned silence from anti-fracking activists. They stood outside Lancashire County Council and disappointment was palpable. I am very disappointed. If they get one, Lancashire had it. Both should have been refused. I am disappointed. People do not want this to go ahead. It is bad for the environment and will impact on climate change and it will be bad for the UK as a whole. There will be no end to it. They will start to drill over the UK. This area is known for agriculture and tourism. The bill has to be approved by the council next week. If it is, this site will be transformed beyond recognition. Why the autumn now be a 50 metre drilling rig here and, by next summer, fracking will begin. -- there will be a 50 metre drilling rig here. Fracking involves injecting water and such like into the rocks. There will be monitoring of air and the rocks. There will be monitoring ofairand water of air and water quality. Cuadrilla accepts it caused Earth tremors in 2011. Those living nearby are not convinced. We are trapped because we cannot sell our houses. Nobody wants to buy them. I feel it will set a precedent. It worries me that it will change. The Government wants the UK to go all out for is shale. Today, in Lancashire, that prospect looks much more likely. -- Today, in Lancashire, that prospect looks much more likely. -- it out for shale. Today’s recommendation needs to be endorsed. If they do, that will set a precedent which could kick-start fracking in the UK. The French President, Francois Hollande, has urged a restart of talks between Greece and its creditors after negotiations in Brussels collapsed at the weekend. In a message to the Greek government he said there was no time to waste. Our Europe Correspondent, Chris Morris, is in Brussels. It feels like deadlock. What chance of a solution before the deadline for Greece to repay at the end of the month? They used to call that the $61+,000I It is the 320 billion euro question! That is the amount of money Greece has in debt. Much of it is owed to other countries in the eurozone. If Greece were to walk away from its debts, those countries would be faced with huge bills, so politicians in those countries, however annoyed they are with Greece, do have an interest in finding a deal. Similarly, for Greece, it could well be facing bankruptcy. If it went bankrupt, who knows what that would mean for the Greek economy? It would mean a considerable amount of pain. The Greek Prime Minister has an interest in finding a deal. Because of that, however difficult it seems, there are still people who feel some kind of deal could be done in the next couple of weeks. We have had a statement from the Greek Prime Minister saying this isn’t about being stubborn, it is about stepping UP being stubborn, it is about stepping up support for his people after five years of brutal policy from Europe. There is no sign that he is backing down. Thank you. Our top story this lunchtime: Reports of a British teenager’s death in a suicide bombing in Iraq - people from his home town of Dewsbury speak out. Andy Murray begins his preparations for Wimbledon - at Queen’s Club - where play is now under way. Later on BBC London: People living on a site near the Thames - where the Magna Carta was signed - take their battle to court to be allowed to stay. And fresh from victory in Germany this weekend, Rafael Nadal heads to Oueen’s to warm up for Wimbledon. The Queen and senior members of the Royal Family have attended a ceremony to mark the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, the document that introduced some of the key rights enjoyed in modern democracies. The event took place in the meadow at Runnymede, close to the River Thames, where it was sealed by King john in 1215. Our Royal correspondent, Nick Witchell, is there. Yes, the Magna Carta, 1215, that is one of those dates we learnt as children. This was a date and an event which had real lasting historical significance. It’s been described as the place where human rights began, Runnymede, by the River Thames at Windsor, where this document, Magna Carta, was sealed by King john 800 years ago. Within these words, in medieval Latin, were guarantees which shaped many of the rules by which we live today. So, what exactly was it that happened 800 years ago? A question for a historian. The beginning of our politics, which I think is a really good thing. Politics is out of fashion. There’s only one alternative to politics and that is civil war. All politics is about resolving conflict. Here we learn to do it peacefully. Magna Carta influenced justice as well as politics. Prince William was shown a new sculpture consisting of 12 bronze chairs entitled The jurors, in recognition of the impact Magna Carta had on the basic principles which attempt to guarantee a fair trial. The Queen attended briefly. She heard the Prime Minister pay tribute to the medieval barons who’d curbed the power of the Crown 800 years ago. And the Prime Minister also called for a renewal of Britain’s approach to the ideals of Magna Carta. Here, in Britain, ironically the place where those ideas were first set out, the good name of human rights has sometimes become distorted and devalued. So, it falls to us in this generation to restore the reputation of those rights and their critical underpinning of our legal system. It’s our duty to safeguard the legacy, the idea, the momentous achievement of those barons. It wasn’t just this country which was influenced by Magna Carta. The principles, which it enshrined of liberty and equality, were embraced by the founding fathers of many other nations, including the United States. A great charter, sealed at Runnymede 800 years ago, whose historic resonance was marked today. Incidentally, the Red Arrows flew over at precisely 12.15pm, so there is no excuse for forgetting the date now! Many thanks. The actions of a mother who ran away with her three-year-old son after a custody battle were ""utterly irresponsible"", a judge has said. Rebecca Minnock handed herself and her son Ethan into police on Friday - after more than two weeks in hiding. jon Kay was in court and he joins us now. What else did the judge have to say? Well, this wasjust What else did the judge have to say? Well, this was just a short procedural hearing, really, after Miss Minnock and her little boy were handed into the authorities at the weekend. Thejudge handed into the authorities at the weekend. The judge took the opportunity with her sitting in front of him in the court to make some comments about the fact that she had taken the little boy on the run for more than a fortnight. The judge said that he had been told by a family friend that Rebecca Minnock had done this as a publicity stunt. Thejudge said that had done this as a publicity stunt. The judge said that that was completely unacceptable, utterly com pletely u na cce pta ble, utterly irresponsible completely unacceptable, utterly irresponsible to ignore the courts but to play the press in this way. He said it would always backfire. As for the little boy at the heart of all this, Ethan, he’s now back in the care of his dad, as the court ordered. Thejudge made no comment about what would happen next. He did say that he wanted Ethan to have an effective relationship with both his parents into the future. Thank you. A Church of England vicar who married his same-sex partner is taking his bishop to an employment tribunal after a job offer as an NHS chaplain was withdrawn when the bishop refused him the necessary licence. The vicar, Canonjeremy Pemberton, argues that the bishop unlawfully discriminated against him in refusing the licence, without which he could not take up the job. Our Religious Affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt, reports. Arriving at the tribunal today, Canon jeremy Pemberton who made history last year when he became the first Church of England vicar to marry his same-sex partner, Lawrence Cunnington. It was a wedding to cost him his newjob as chaplain to the NHS in Nottingham. That was because, lastjune, acting bishop for Southwell and Nottingham, Richard Inwood, revoked Mr Pemberton’s permission to officiate as a priest in that dioceses. He then wrote to the NHS Trust, saying he would not give Mr Pemberton a licence for the newjob. The NHS withdrew its offer. At the tribunal, witnesses for the bishop will argue the church’s doctrine makes clear those in holy orders cannot enter into a same-sex marriage because the church still sees marriage as solely between a man and a woman, arguing that the clergy must live out the church’s teaching. I hope the tribunal will settle the point that when you become someone who works for a church, you abide by its teaching. But gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell says the church should not be able to claim religious opt outs from equality law. I don’t understand why the church should be above the law. That is the essence of this case. The church is pleading exemptions from the equality laws that apply to everyone else and that surely cannot be right. The issue of same-sex marriage is one that risks splitting the church. Traditionalists argue the doctrine on marriage should not be changed. One thing that does concern me is the idea that somehow the church could be put under pressure by the courts to change its doctrines, to change its understanding of marriage and who it takes on and licences as a minister. This tribunal is a real test case for the Church of England and will be closely watched by all sides of the debate on same-sex marriage. It will sit for the rest of this week and give its ruling at a later date. The deadline for nominations in the Labour leadership contest has closed. Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham all have enough MPs backing them in the race to succeed Ed Miliband. And a short while ago, it was confirmed that the final contender, the left-winger, jeremy Corbyn, also has enough support to stand. Let’sjoin our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith. Norman, jeremy Corbyn has been given support to get on to the ballot paper by people who don’t want him to win? It’s been something like out of Whacky Races here today, with jeremy Corbyn gasping over the finishing line before the noon deadline, with his supporters pleading with Labour MPs to give him the last few votes. He made it, not because people back his left-wing views, but people think there ought to be a broader range of views represented in this leadership contest, which tells us of a lingering unease about this contest, an unease that they are plunging into it before they have sat down and worked out what went wrong and where they ought to go next. An unease, too, frankly, about the calibre of the four candidates, which is why some Labour MPs are pressing for a rule change to make it easier to get shot of another Labour Leader because their fear is, they could be landed with someone who just isn’t up to the job, so they want a rule change which will mean 30 Labour MPs have to sign a letter and that can trigger a contest, so they are not stuck, as some think they were stuck with Ed Miliband and Gordon Brown. One final thing - Miliband and Gordon Brown. One final thing - the hope is, having this broader range of contenders, it might inject some energy and excitement into a contest which has been a little bit lacklustre, in fact the most exciting thing so far has beenjeremy Corbyn minus Mutley making it on to the finishing line! Health researchers are calling for the upper age limit for screening for cervical cancer to be raised. They say figures show the cancer is not just a young woman’s disease, after research found one in five new cases is diagnosed in the over-65s. An official day of mourning is taking place in Georgia for at least 12 people killed in flash floods in the capital Tbilisi. Up to 21+ people are still missing, and dozens more have been left homeless. Many animals - including hippos, lions, and tigers - have been roaming the streets after the floodwaters destroyed their enclosures at a zoo. Sarah Rainsford reports. The floodwater devastated Tbilisi. Cars, trees and people were all swept up in the deadly torrent. And these images show how widespread the damage is - whole areas coated in filth and debris after a small city stream burst its banks. Rescuers are still searching for missing residents. And there’s a new danger now on these streets. It’s thought dozens of wild animals escaped when the zoo flooded - majestic, but dangerous creatures, spotted right in the city centre. Like this bear, left clinging when the water level fell. Some have been tranquillised safely. But there’s anger that others were shot and killed. Residents accuse police of going on safari. The zoo’s director said people have been phoning a hotline after sighting more animals, but nothing’s been confirmed yet and no-one has been hurt. It is possible that many of the animals simply drowned. Their enclosures are still deep underwater. Hundreds died, but dozens remain unaccounted for. A worrying thought, perhaps, for the volunteers pitching in for the massive clean-up. For this hippo, it’s already home time. But it’s thought lions, tigers and even bears could still be on the loose. Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow. Andy Murray begins his preparations for Wimbledon at Queen’s Club - where play is now under way. The British number one is the top seed ahead of new French Open Champion Stan Wawrinka. Rafael Nadal is also competing, and arrives at Queen’s having just won his first grass-court title since 2010. This morning, he met local schoolchildren to try to encourage new British players on to court. Time for a look at the weather. Here’sjohn Hammond. It should be fine through this afternoon for Queen’s. We have many other sporting outdoor events over the next few days. By and large, a lot of useable weather. The weather is behaving itself for a time. There will be some rain, but there will be a good deal of dry weather as well. There will be some rain for some through this week. High pressure is ridging across the country right now which means it’s a lovely day out there. It was a cloudy start across some southern counties. A little bit of puffy fairweather cloud, but it won’t spoil things at all. That sunshine is strong.

The rising cost of living in the capital as rents reach a new all time high. And stabbed to death while walking to work - a neighbour stands trial for murder. Good evening and welcome to the BBC’s News At Six. The mother of a British man killed last night in Kenya after going there to fight with Islamic extremists has told the BBC how her world fell apart when she heard the news. In an exclusive interview, Sally Evans says she had not heard from her 25-year-old son Thomas, who converted to Islam, since December. She’s spoken of her anger at members of the local community in Buckinghamshire, who she blames for radicalising him. Thomas Evans, a 25-year-old from high Wycombe, who died fighting for al-Shabab in Kenyon. Today, his mother and brother told me how they confirmed his death for themselves last night by seeing a picture on social media. I looked on Twitter, and the first thing I found was a picture of his body. That is how you found out? Yes, there was no doubt. Thomas became increasingly distant from his family after he converted to Islam. His family blame his subsequent shift to extremism on people in the local community. Without a doubt, people within the area. I think it must have been online as well. Not initially. It was not initially. It might have been towards the end, but initially it was people he was mixing with. He ended up fighting with al-Shabab, the group involved in the attack on the Westgate shopping centre. He tried tojoin the group in 2011 but was stopped by police. His family want to know why he was not then stopped from taking another route if you months later. They had concerned about him, why could they not take his passport? Why did they not speak to us? We could have said... I would have taken his passport. These are the weapons he used as they launched an attack on an army camp in Kenya yesterday. His family know this is how others will remember him. It is hard, because we remember him for being my brother, your son, but to everybody else he is a terrorist, they do not have the good memories we have. No. The question again, white and other young Briton has gone out to fight and to die. The police and Muslim community leaders are trying to find out what led a 17-year-old boy from Dewsbury to join Islamic State and apparently blow himself up in Iraq. 11 people were killed when he and three others blew up vehicles at an oil refinery at the weekend. Talha Asmal is believed to be Britain’s youngest suicide bomber. His family say they are devastated by his death. Talha Asmal, a 17-year-old who should be taking his A-levels in a Yorkshire school. He is believed to have become a suicide bomber. This is him being briefed about the attack which killed at least 11 people. He looks calm and under no duress, even sat next to the crude bomb on the passenger seat. At his family home in Dewsbury, mourners came and went today. They believe he was a naive teenager groomed over the internet tojoin IS. The idea that he would kill himself in this way is a terrible shock. Everybody was hoping and praying that he would come back safely. Obviously, face the law. But this has shattered the family in a way that is hard for them to comprehend. His school is refusing to comment until his death is confirmed, but I have talked to one sixth former who knew him for years who simply does not believe that he was groomed anonymously on the internet. He thinks that somebody close to him in his life, in his community here, pushed him in the direction of IS. But if that is true, say locals, the community would have done something about it. I am certain that if we found out that there was somebody who was planting these ideas into the minds of young people, converting them into these terrorist activities, we would want to confront them and challenge them. But whether it was the internet or a more-direct approach, what has happened has left other parents here frightened. Every night, I sleep with the fear that maybe my child would do the same thing. You always fear for your children, because you never know, the next minute, where they end up. Was it Hassan Munshi, the next-door neighbour whom he disappeared with, who influenced him? Nothing has been heard from him, compounding the misery in this Yorkshire street. Well, tonight police in Yorkshire have confirmed that they are investigating the whereabouts of 12 people from the same family, most of them children, who’ve gone missing after a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia last month. What more do we know about them? This is a family who went on a family who went on April Gummidge to Saudi Arabia last month, they were due back here last week, but they failed to return. There relatives have become increasingly concerned. A three sisters in 30s and their nine children, aged between five and 15. The authorities began an investigation. They traced the majority of the family on a flight from Saudi Arabia last Tuesday to Istanbul, when their mobile phones were switched off. Nothing has been heard of them since. The Turkish authorities have no trace of them. The concern is that they have perhaps travelled from Turkey to the neighbouring country of Syria, and thatis neighbouring country of Syria, and that is one line of investigation. West Yorkshire Police are extreme concern for the safety of the family, and theirfamily are gravely worried, they want them home. The enquirer is in the hands of the foreign authorities at the moment, but there is a big question, why did they not return, why did they go to Turkey, and if they have gone to severe, what has caused them to go there? It is something I am sure we will hear more about in the next few hours. The parents of two teenage girls who were crushed to death at the Hillsborough disaster have been hearing details of their last moments at an inquest into the deaths. 19-year-old Sarah and her 15-year-old sister Victoria Hicks were among the 96 people who were killed at the FA Cup semi-final in April in 1989. These inquests have already spent many months hearing evidence about Hillsborough, including testimony from those who were in charge on the day. But now the court here has begun the process of hearing individual inquests for each of the 96 people who died. There is some close and personal detail being heard, and today it was the turn of the two teenage sisters whose deaths destroyed a family. This is the last time the family were together, their images painstakingly picked out on Blu-ray CCTV, amongst thousands of others arriving at Hillsborough. Today, all that Trevor and jenny Higgs have left is a quest to know everything possible about the tragedy in which both of their children died. This is where it gets personal. A tough three days. The accountability issues, every other issue, but then it comes down to the personal stuff and it is difficult. Sarah was studying chemistry at university, her sister Vicky dream of being a sports reporter. This footage was taken by BBC cameras and captures their last-minute alive. What their last- minute alive. What followed their last-minute alive. What followed this is too distressing to broadcast. As the crush worsens, Sarah clung on to Vicky with a look of terror on her face, sobbing, can somebody help my sister? one witness said he found the 15-year-old unconscious with her arms outstretched like jesus on the cross. Trevor and jenny have spent more than a quarter of a century fighting to know every detail of what happened to their daughters. They have attended inquests, Inquiries Act and investigations, but none of that experience can have made today any easier to bear, and tomorrow Trevor will give the jury his own account of the last time he saw his children. A judge has strongly criticised a woman who went on the run with her three-year-old son for more than two weeks after a bitter custody battle. Rebecca Minnock, from Highbridge in Somerset, handed herself and her son Ethan into the authorities on Friday. The judge at Bristol Crown Court accused her of being utterly irresponsible and said she had staged a publicity stunt. Who’s going to be the next leader of the Labour Party? Well, today we came a step closer to finding out when the names of the four candidates who have secured enough nominations to go on the ballot paper were confirmed. Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham and jeremy Corbyn are all in with a chance of replacing Ed Miliband. Our Political Editor Nick Robinson looks at who could become Labour’s new leader in September. They call it the blink test, take a look, then blink, then see if you can imagine him as your next Prime Minister. Orwhat can imagine him as your next Prime Minister. Or what about her? Will she ever be seen on the steps of number ten? she ever be seen on the steps of numberten? Finally, what she ever be seen on the steps of number ten? Finally, what about him? Is the next Labour leader is to have any chance of walking up Downing Street as Prime Minister, they will have to face up to the fact that their party lost to elections, not one. Decimated by the SNP in Scotland, but also well defeated by the Tories in England. The early favourite is Andy Burnham, Health Secretary under Gordon Brown, the working class football loving boy from Liverpool, he led the campaign forjustice for the victims of Hillsborough. He claims he can reconnect Labour with its beating heart. That is what I am, a Labour man through and through, and those values are what have guided me through my life, and we need to bring them forward for the 21st century. What made you say that this manifesto, the losing manifesto, of the best you had ever stored on? For people on zero hours contract or in part-time work or freedom get enough hours so they can bring home enough pay, it had feel things to say, and we must not throw that away. Yvette Cooper’s pitch, she is the credible alternative Prime Minister, having been a minister for more than a dozen years. Ending up as Gordon Brown’s Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. And economist who got a first at Oxford before studying at Harvard and the LSE, she married Ed Balls soon after she became an MP. If she is the first woman to be elected as leader, she will be the famous one. You keep warning the party not to swallow the Tory manifesto, Tory myth. Who is doing that and what are the myths? We were too narrow, we have got to reach out, but if we think that moving a narrow party a bit to the left or a bit to the right is going to solve our problems, it will not, we have to reach out to every corner of the country, win back the Tory voters we have lost and the Ukip voters we have lost and the SNP voters. The woman she has in her site is Liz Kendall, she has never been a minister, she was not in Ed Miliband’s top team. She says what counts is her experience in the real world. She was a young political adviser in the Tony Blair years, but she is the only one not afraid to speak up as an unashamed Blairite. While other candidates were ministers, I was running a big charity, it was helping new parents and babies get the best start in life, and I have run a big NHS organisation representing Anne Boleyn services. Do you think being at Watford Liz is part of your bill? Watford is the sort of seat really to back, I represent Leicester West, the kind of seat we need to hold. We need to build a broad coalition of support. Last on the list, a veteran of protest about Iraq and austerity and much more besides. jeremy Corbyn was nominated today by many MPs who do not agree with him, do not even wanting to be leader, simply, they said, to the debate. I recognise that my views on austerity, nuclear weapons, a number of other issues, they are not in the majority of the parliamentary Labour Party. I entered on the urging of some colleagues, just to ensure there is that discussion, that debate. Believe it or not, on the day we got the short list, moves are growing to change the rules to ditch the next Labour leader if they are not up to the job. Our top story this evening... ' , SEVEFIS, B Later on BBC London. A fire rips through a row of shops in east London - we’re live in Hackney with the latest. And capturing the capital on camera over seven decades - the photographer who started out at the age ofjust eight. Bush launches his campaign. Coming UP Bush launches his campaign.

Coming up in Sportsday - Aston Villa say they will speak to jack Grealish after images appeared to show the 19-year-old lying in the road whilst on holiday in Tenerife. It’s a whilst controversial process that has divided communities, Now, plans to use fracking to extract shale gas have moved a major step closer. Planning officers in Lancashire have recommended that the energy firm Cuadrilla should be allowed to begin fracking at one site near Blackpool. But councillors have to give their final approval next week. Our industry correspondent john Moylan is in the village of Little Plumpton for us now. Yes, we are in between Preston and Blackpool. You mayjust be able to see Blackpool Tower in the distance. There are said to be huge volumes of the gas underground here. just a few metres behind me is where fracking could get under way in Britain. It is an ordinary field in Lancashire, in a region known for agriculture and tourism. But it is now in the fracking front line. Protesters gathering outside Lancashire County Council had hoped plans would be rejected. The news that one could still go ahead was met with dismay. If one of them had it, both of them should have been refused. I am disappointed. It is bad for the environment, for climate change, and bad for the UK. If they start it in Lancashire, they will be doing it all over the UK. The recommendation still has to be approved by the council next week, but if it is, this farmland will start to be completely transformed into what the industry calls a fracking pad. In the autumn, exploration will begin. The rig will be erected and they will drill to a depth of about two miles to start identifying where the best rocks are, and by next summer, fracking could begin. There could be UP fracking could begin. There could be up to 100 sites in the years to come. They have spoken of up to 100 sites across the Lancashire area. That is across the Lancashire area. The total surface area would be approximately two kilometres square taken up. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into shale rocks deep underground. That releases gas which has been held inside for millions of years. At the site, there will be independent monitoring of air and water quality and any seismic movement. Cuadrilla accepts it likely caused earth tremors when it fracked in the area in 2011. But those living nearby are not convinced. ~ I think because this industry is so untried and untested, and it is self regulated, you do not want to take those kind of risks. We are trapped because we cannot sell our houses. Nobody wants to buy them. The Government wants the UK to go all out for shale. Today, in Lancashire, that prospect looks much more likely. One of the victims of child sex abuse in Rotherham has spoken for the first time about how she was abandoned by the authorities. The girl, who became pregnant at the age of 12, says at one stage a police officer found her in locked in a flat. She’d been left there for two days. But after freeing her, the police never investigated what had happened. The BBC can also reveal that a report outlining the scale of abuse across the town was distributed to several senior police officers but nothing was done. Alison Holt has this exclusive report. Lisa is in her 20s now. Her story demonstrates the extent of the failure to protect a voluble children in the South Yorkshire town of Rotherham. It also raises questions for us all. At 12 she was being sexually exploited by a group of men. Her mother tried unsuccessfully to get help from police and social services. This flat now has different owners, but 14 years ago, Lisa, whose identity we have disguised, was locked in here for two days by her abusers. It was just like dirty here for two days by her abusers. It wasjust like dirty and was just like dirty and really damp and disgusting. The police officer walked in and shone a torch because there was no electric... Speaking for the first time, she told panorama how her mum found her and asked a policeman to get her out - but there was no further investigation. Hejust asked if but there was no further investigation. He just asked if we wanted a lift home. Weimann said no. You then asked my mum if you wanted to do a statement, and because she was working the next morning, she said she could not do it their own then, and he said he would get back to her about it, and he never did. Two complaints have been made about the police officer, and he subsequently died after being hit by a car earlier this year in what was described as a tragic accident. South Yorkshire Police is not commenting on the case. Hannah Rama has also learned a key report written in 2006 by a former police analyst warning of the scale of exploitation in Rotherham was sent to about 90 people, including high-ranking police officers. It was sent to each of the district commanders in the six districts in South Yorkshire Police. They were in Sheffield and Rotherham. It went to senior officers within the senior command team as well. Force says it is in a very different position now, with 74 officers currently working on 198 live investigations into child sexual exploitation. It was notjust child sexual exploitation. It was not just Rotherham where child sexual exploitation. It was notjust Rotherham where people did not ask the right questions. Lisa’s story made national headlines when she became pregnant aged 12. She named five men. There were arrests, but the debate was about sex education, not abuse. They were trying to make me look like I am an adult. Why would a 12-year-old be having five lovers? The challenge for us all is to make sure that in future we do ask the right questions.

His father and his brother were both Presidents of the United States. Now the former Florida governor jeb Bush is hoping to follow in their footsteps. Today he is launching his bid to become the Republican Party’s presidential candidate. But he’s up against at least 10 other hopefuls. Our North America editor, jon Sopel, is in Miami. Thank you very much. Welcome to Miami, this community college weeing the biggest academic institution in Florida, and also the most ethnically diverse. jeb Bush’s pitch is going to be that he will be the champion of the dispossessed, the marginalised, the people who have been left behind. But look at the slogan. No mention of the family surname. He got himself into real knots about the most obvious question of all, about his brother, when he was asked, knowing what we know now, was it right to invade Iraq? Initially he said yes, which prompted outcry. He then screeched to do a U-turn, leaving rubber on the road, and then he said no. The other problem he has had is that he was hoping just by name recognition, he would attract so much money that it would deter other Republican candidates from entering the race. That has not happened. A few months ago they said this would be a shoo-in forjeb Huish, but they are not saying that today. The Queen and thousands of guests have marked the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta - the document which established that the monarch, like everyone else, was subject to the rule of law. The event took place in the meadow at Runnymede, close to the River Thames, where the Magna Carta was sealed by King john in 1215. Our royal correspondent Nick Witchell is there. It’s been described as the place where human rights began. Runnymede, by the River Thames at Windsor, where this document, Magna Carta, was sealed by King john 800 years ago. Within these words, in medieval Latin, were guarantees which shaped many of the rules by which we live today. So, what exactly was it that happened 800 years ago? A question for a historian. The beginning of our politics - which I think is a really good thing. Politics is out of fashion. There’s only one alternative to politics - and that is civil war. All politics is about resolving conflict. Here, we learn to do it peacefully. Magna Carta influenced justice as well as politics. Prince William was shown a new sculpture, consisting of 12 bronze chairs, entitled The jurors, in recognition of the impact Magna Carta had on the basic principles which attempt to guarantee a fair trial. The Queen attended briefly. She heard the Prime Minister pay tribute to the medieval barons who had curbed the power of the Crown 800 years ago. And the Prime Minister also called for a renewal of Britain’s approach to the ideals of Magna Carta. Here in Britain, ironically, the place where those ideas were first set out, the good name of human rights has sometimes become distorted and devalued. So, it falls to us in this generation to restore the reputation of those rights and their critical underpinning of our legal system. It is our duty to safeguard the legacy, the idea, the momentous achievement of those barons. It wasn’t just this country which was influenced by Magna Carta. Its principles were embraced by the founding fathers of several other nations. It was the Magna Carta and its declaration about the rights of the individual which helped shape the constitution of the United States of America. It was quoted by Mahatma Gandhi in India and Nelson Mandela in South Africa, among others. The great charter, sealed at Runnymede 800 years ago, whose historic resonance was marked today. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Darren Bett. Nice day to day and it looks quite promising for tomorrow, and indeed, for the week ahead. It will feel quite pleasant and temperatures will peak for some of us around the middle of the week. Not without some rain, mind you. There will be some damp weather coming into Scotland and Northern Ireland overnight tonight. But crucially for these areas, there will be more cloud in last night, it will be an awful lot milder. Prospects of more sunshine to come tomorrow. A good-looking day for England and Wales. Western Scotland and Northern Ireland hanging on to a bit more cloud. Probably staying dry for Northern Ireland, not much sunshine here. Some sunshine from time to time for northern England, and across the rest of England and Wales, it looks like we should see some decent spells of sunshine tomorrow. The sunshine will be every bit as strong as today, and it may be feeling a bit warmer. For the tennis tomorrow, it looks fine and dry. Temperatures climbing even higher on Wednesday. A bit cooler and fresher further north and west. The best of the sunshine may be across the the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east of England, and this is where we have got the high temperatures on Wednesday. After this front, a slightly cooler north-westerly breeze. That is all. It is goodbye from me. The cost of renting in the capital reaches an all time high. ~ Iam I am trapped in the renting system.

We start tonight with the latest on the increasing cost of living in the capital. For the first time ever the average rent in London has surpassed £1,50O a month. And a separate report reveals that house prices have reached another all time high with the average asking price now in excess of £600,000. Alpa Patel has more. It’s perhaps no surprise to Londoners that they are paying the highest rents in the country but the reason these figures are so headline grabbing is because for the first time average rent in London has broken the £1,50O per month mark. Rents have increased on average across the country also. Behind the rise is a familiar story. Rising demand and a lack of supply. This person lives in Islington. Like so many of her friends she has no choice but to share her home. And the fear that her rent may go up is never far from her mind. Flatshare is completely normal. Friends in other places like Manchester are looking to buy houses. That is not a possibility for me. I have a job and a decent wage but I am trapped in the renting system. I have had to leave places before because they have put the rent up and have priced me out of the house that I was living in. You just feel unstable and insecure. There is nothing you can do about it. That is the rental market for you. Many of us would like to buy. But there is not good news on that front either. The average price of a home in Greater London is now more than £600,000. That is a record high and a rise of more than £30,000. What is driving the demand and how long will it last? There is a strong economic backdrop. Particularly in London which is the strongest economic performer in the country. A lot of immigration is coming in so demand is starting to go up. Coupled with that we have very few homes for sale in the capital. People are not putting their homes up for sale because it is a good asset to hold on to. We have got a few buyers completing for properties and it is driving up prices. I want to leave you with one last figure. London’s population is expected to rise to 10 million over the next 15 years. The fear is unless more affordable housing is made available thousands will struggle to pay the rent and face being priced out of London altogether. Coming up later in the programme: The row over people camping out on a site near to where the Magna Carta was signed - the landowner takes legal action to evict them. The family of a six month-old baby boy who was cremated in Enfield in the 1990s, claim his ashes were never returned to them. It follows an inquiry into a crematorium in Shrewsbury, which found parents were denied their children’s remains over a 15 year period. Let’s cross to Alex Bushill who’s been following this story, and has got more details. The mother has described how she lost her baby boy in 1994. She describes her heartache at losing her son and at never being able to very heaven. That is because the crematorium never returned the burnt ashes. -- crematorium never returned the burnt ashes. -- never being able to bury him. A two-year investigation by the BBC has uncovered more concerns about other crematoria where a similar situation may have occurred. What have the council and the crematorium said? crematorium said ? The council was crematorium said? The council was running this crematorium in 1984. They have declined to comment. In 2012 this crematorium was taken over by the company Dignity. They have said that they have made a substantial development to install new equipment. spoke to the lead on our campaign. We need a change in the law and practices. We need the installation of a National Inspectorate of crematoria. And we need a national investigation. An enquiry has recommended a national court of practice. We await the formal response of the Government. A former Conservative councillor who pretended to be a qualified barrister after failing law school three times has been spared jail. Monika juneja who was a senior member of Guilford Council repeatedly lied about her degree and law qualifications to gain social status. She’s been given a 14-month suspended sentence and ordered to serve 200 hours community service. It’s the fastest growing sector in London with around 250,000 people working in the tech and digital industries. Today, that was celebrated at the start of London Tech Week, but there were calls for further financial support and better connectivity to keep the capital at the forefront of digital development. Victoria Hollins reports. Need a place to park in London? This can help. You can search. It gives you the restricted hours. You can see where it is silly to park. London has been an incredible test-bed for these products. We can expand out. Some of the rising stars came together this morning. The aim is to drive the best ideas. You can capture images of your eardrum and send that to doctors and specialists. But there are still challenges. Funding is the biggest concern for most start-ups. There has been great progress with the appetite for risk amongst investors. But that needs to improve. Now it is here and it is here to stay. And what about the future? There have been more projects in London in recent years. The sector is worth £18 billion per year. The challenge is to infuse the next generation. What we want to see is London companies going from being modestly sized perfectly formed entities to that kind of billion pound giants. Computing is on the school curriculum but many special centres like this have had to close. Children are being these skills. They use computers and mobile phones at home. At school they use pen and paper. They need access to technology. The capital is not Silicon Valley yet, but this event proves that you do not have to look across the Atlantic to find the innovators of the future. More now on the man from Buckinghamshire who’s believed to have been killed while fighting for al-Shabab in Kenya. Thomas Evans converted to Islam while growing up near High Wycombe. Speaking exclusively to BBC London a former friend who introduced him to the religion, says he became brainwashed and cut off from those who tried to challenge his views. Our Home Affairs Correpondent Nick Beake reports. From a schoolboy to an Islamic militant. He did Thomas Evans embark on this deadly path? one of his former friends spoke to the BBC. It is scary how they can go off on that direction. The friend asked us to protect his identity. He said he met Thomas Evans in 2008 when they helped keep young people out of trouble. He was very confident. He likes to get involved. After a few months Thomas Evans became interested in his friend’s religion. He asked questions. He likes the answers to the questions. He found himself attracted to Islam. What went wrong? He isolated himself and maybe went to the internet for information. And then he ended up finding stuff that was more hardline than what was initially spoken about. You saw him doing that? Ifound initially spoken about. You saw him doing that? I found some stuff on his computer and I said, what are you doing listening to him? From that point he did not spend much time with me. Thomas Evans later left the UK and joint Islamic militants. On Sunday he was killed in tenure. He is misguided but I do not doubt he was sincere. This is the danger. There are a lot of sincere youths who do not have the knowledge to back up their intentions. They are doing things that are not great in the name of something that is right. If you see injustice in the world you do not become part of the injustice. You try to figure out how you can reduce that situation and stop it becoming an injustice. It is an insight into our young man born in Britain, radicalised in a village, and who died fighting with militants hundreds of miles from home. Alison Morrison was stabbed to death on a street in Harrow last December on her way to work. Today a neighbour has gone on trial accused of her murder. Trevor Gibbons denies the charge, but admits manslaughter. Tarah Welsh is outside at the old Bailey and has been following the case. Alison Morrison died one week before Christmas last year. The prosecution says that she was murdered by an angry man that killed his neighbour out of revenge. The day before she was killed Trevor Gibbon has pleaded guilty to have lasting her and her family and was beat the subject of a restraining order. This goes back to 2011 when Alison Morrison and her family moved in. Her neighbour complained about the noise. Name Mac made every opportunity to escalate things -- made every opportunity to escalate things -- Trevor Gibbon to every opportunity. The prosecution said it was no confidence that he was armed with two knives and it was not a spur of the moment decision. after the attack and that the victim said that he did that to her as she lay dying. Trevor Gibbon Adam Smith to manslaughter but denied murder-- Trevor Gibbon admitted. The prosecution rejects the plea of manslaughter. The prosecution said he did nothing to try to bring his own life to an end. Trevor Gibbon denies murder and the trial continues. More than 70 firefighters have been tackling a blaze in a row of shops in Hackney. One man was taken to hospital suffering from burns and smoke inhalation. Marc Ashdown is there for us now. Marc. Things are more or less under control. But it was a different picture this afternoon. It is believed the fire broke out in a joinery shop. I have been told by witnesses that a member of staff was working on a large piece of kit and an extractor fan exploded. One man suffered from burns and smoke inhalation. He is recovering well. 70 firefighters tackle this. It is more or less under control. Firefighters will be here until the early hours. At the moment it is thought to have been caused by an accident. There have been no serious injuries. Still to come: I will be talking to one of the greatest tennis players of all time. And he discovered a camera at the age of eight and he has been taking photographs of London for seven decades. We will talk about his passion for photography and the capital. The Queen and thousands of guests have marked the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta at a ceremony in Runnymede. The event took place as efforts were underway to evict a group of people living in a settlement in nearby woods. The land owner claims they’re trespassing but the group say their human rights are being violated. Gareth Furby reports. Ina few In a few hundred yards away from the site of today’s Magna Carta event is a very different scene. A settlement will out of scrap timber. Some of these people have been squatting here for three years. This is my house. This person says it took her nine months to build. She used to live in Chiswick but sees life here is better stop this is the kitchen and living area. I was living next to a busy road and I could hear the traffic. I had enough. But this settlement now has a problem. The land owner wants to build a new development on top of the hill to D one a possession order saying that these people are trespassing. Some people here are now planning an appeal to the High Court. This man, a gardener, has lived here for 11 months. The people are on the land trying to use land that was not being used. Today police were keeping a close watch on this site. just over this hilltop... The argument in court was that the Magna Carta gives them the right to live in the woods. The Forest Charter gave people the right to subsist in the forest. But at court this afternoon that argument was rejected. People in this settlement is described it as a travesty of justice but unless there is a successful appeal the land owner will now take possession of these woods. He’s widely regarded as one of the best tennis players of all time. And less than 24 hours after winning a tournament in Germany Rafael Nadal arrived in London today to compete at Queens - the traditional warm-up event for Wimbledon. But as Chris Slegg reports - before heading to the courts he stopped off to surprise some London schoolchildren. Victory yesterday afternoon for Rafael Nadal, his first grass court title since winning Wimbledon in 2010. This morning on the practice courts at Queen’s Club they youngsters from an Academy had no idea about the surprise that had been laid on. Rafael Nadal. I was speechless. I could not believe that he was walking in. These youngsters are meeting a true sporting great. Yesterday ‘s triumph was his 66th title. He has won 14 grand slams. His only triumph at Queens team in 2008 and he has not played here for four years. 2008 and he has not played here for fouryears. But four years. But on the occasions that he has he has reached the Wimbledon final every time. What is it about this venue that helps with Wimbledon preparation? This is an historic event. Everybody is happy when you are playing. It is a tournament that makes me feel great, especially when the sunshine is beer. You saw the surprise on the faces of the youngsters. What did you say to them? The most important thing is to enjoy the sport. He is my hero. He was an expert. He taught as trucks. He might have a feud new supporters. # A feud new supporters. He picked up his first camera at the age ofjust eight years old and has been clicking away ever since. Seven decades on and Londoner Colin 0’Brien has collected a unique photographic record of our changing city and the communities that live here. Our Arts Correspondent Brenda Emmanus met him at his home in Hackney ahead of his latest exhibition. Sitting with a couple of friends with a camera that he found lying around at home. For nearly 70 years he has been photographing the life of Londoners. When you discovered this camera who were your subject? Those closest to me like my mother. And my father. Then my friends. From taking pictures of family and friends he graduated to documenting the lives of his local community and beyond. Did you travel around? Initially I stuck to the area I was brought up in. After that I travelled further afield. I used to take pictures with -- pictures of the city. He sold itjust to Fleet Street and then took a job at the College of printing. He has never stopped taking photographs. What is the difference in the 1960s compared to now? People are more suspicious now. People think you are trying to get something out of them. His images reflect the journey Londoners have travelled. The exhibition is on until August. Let’s see how the weather’s shaping up this week. Wendy’s got the forecast for us. For most it will be a lovely week. It will be almost entirely dry. There will also be some sunshine. Here is the temperature trend. A fine evening at the moment. Tomorrow we’ll start with closed in the sky. -- Tomorrow we’ll start with closed in the sky. -- cloud. Temperatures will pick up nicely. As we go through Wednesday there will be cloud drifting. It will be warmer. On Thursday this cold front will go through. It will freshen things up towards the end of the week. High-pressure still dominating. Here is the week ahead. Fine sunny spells and lasting through the end of the week. As we get is towards next weekend it might be a repeat of the one we have just had. More cloud and occasional showers. Now the main headlines. The mother of a British man believed killed in Kenya after going to fight with Islamic extremists has spoken to the BBC.

Good evening. 12 members of the same family from Bradford are missing after they failed to return from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. The three sisters and their nine children, aged between three and 15, were supposed to fly home four days ago. A lawyer representing the women’s husbands says ""the most probable of the possibilities"" is that they have travelled to Syria to join Islamic State. Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, reports. Three Bradford sisters, their nine children, missing, feared to be trying to head to Syria. The smiling faces, the youngestjust trying to head to Syria. The smiling faces, the youngest just a few years old, now a real concern about where they are. The family’s lawyer met tonight with the three fathers who have been left behind and says they are distressed. There has been no contact with them since the 9th of june. Unfortunately, we can only fear the worst. This is the house that one of the sisters lived in. Neighbours say they moved out last year. Relatives say they feel helpless that there are extremely worried about what is happening to them, the group has been out of contact for nearly a week. From the streets of Bradford to possible danger, it is thought they could have followed the brother of the three women who has been in Syria. And time.

Those who know the family say he was a nice lad. Bayer reveres the devastated with the news that they have heard. They are very emotional and upset. -- they are obviously devastated. My heart goes out to the family. Did they have any idea that he was being radicalised? No. There were no signs or symptoms. The family are clear that so-called Islamic State does not represent Islam. He was a really good person. Are you worried for the other children in the community? Yes, I am so worried about other families, other sons. What are you telling your sons? What other communities owing to the sons? Stopped you know, everything should stop -- Stopped you know, everything should stop -- what other community is saying to sons. He travelled with his next-door neighbour whose brother had been convicted of terrorist offences. As a family grieves for their son and fathers worry for their missing children, the steady flow of Britons to Syria shows little sign of slowing. Well, there’s growing pressure to do more to stop young Britons joining Islamic extremists. The mother of a 25-year-old British man killed last night in Kenya, fighting for Al Shabab, has told the BBC that her world fell apart when she heard the news. In an exclusive interview, Sally Evans says she had not heard from her son, Thomas, who converted to Islam since December. And she spoke of her anger at members of the local community who she blames for radicalising him. Here’s our security correspondent, Gordon Corera. Thomas Evans, a 25-year-old from High Wycombe, who died fighting for the terrorist group Al-Shabab in Kenya. Today, the bodies were put on this way by the army, along with what they said were the weapons. Back in the suburban streets of high Wycombe where he grew up, his mother and younger brother told me how they learned of his death last night by seeing a photograph on social media. I looked on Twitter, and the first thing I found was a picture of his body. And that is how you found out? Yes. We knew it was him. Thomas Evans became increasingly distant from his family after he converted to Islam. His family blame his subsequent shift to extremism on the local community. Without a doubt, it was people in the area. I think it must have been online as well. Not initially. It might have been a little bit towards the end, but initially, it was people he was mixing with. Al-Shabab of Al-Sha bab of Somalia behind the devastating attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Kenya. Evans tried to go out to join them in 2011, but was stopped by police. His family want to know why he was not stopped when he made another attempt a few months later. They had concerns about him. Why didn’t they take his passport? Why didn’t they speak to us? We could have said... If I had known, I would have taken his passport. But when they let him fly to Egypt, I thought there was nothing to worry about, they have let him go. An Army spokesperson announced the death of Thomas Evans and the other fighters on Kenyan TV today. His family say thatis on Kenyan TV today. His family say that is not how they will remember him. It’s hard, because we remember him for being my brother, your son. But to everyone else, he’sjust a terrorist. They don’t have the good memories that we have. No. And we will always have them. But we just won’t have him any more. Gordon is with me now. Why are Britons still heading to fight? Every very different cases tonight. All the talk about the Internet, it is offered personal contacts that lead to people going out. We talk of the local community, some people in high Wycombe, but also in the Bradford case when a brother has come out. The law of this jihadist ideology remains very strong. Does Max Lu. Around 50 Britons are thought to have gone to Somalia. One of the problems is that the government hasn’t really found a way of countering that ideology. The romantic appeal in some parts of the Muslim community to go out there. What’s more, I heard from Sally Evans. There is criticism from families that they don’t always know who to turn to and how to stop people at risk of travelling. There is a problem here in spotting the people at risk of travelling, disrupting the recruiters, working with the families, and countering the jihadist ideology. And this is all something that I think government and police are still really struggling with. For that reason, the numbers are going up, and I think they are set to continue to go up. The four contenders for the leadership of the Labour Party have been confirmed, with the left-winger, jeremy Corbyn, securing enough support from MPs to join the contest moments before the nominations closed. His name will now appear on the ballot paper alongside the Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham; the Shadow Home Scretary, Yvette Cooper and the Shadow Health Minister, Liz Kendall. The four will appear in a series of public and televised hustings before the winner is announced in September. This report from our political editor, Nick Robinson, contains some flash photography. They call it the blink test. Take a look, then blink and then see if you can imagine him as your next Prime Minister. Or what about her? Will she ever be seen on the steps of Number Ten? And finally what about him? If the next Labour leader is to have any chance of walking up Downing Street as Prime Minister, they’ll have to face up to the fact their party lost, in effect, two elections, not one. Decimated by the SNP in Scotland but well defeated by the Tories in England as well. The early favourite is Andy Burnham, Health Secretary under Gordon Brown. The working-class, football-loving boy from Liverpool led the campaign forjustice for the victims of hills Hillsborough. He claims he can reconnect Labour with its beating heart. That’s what I am, a Labour man through and through. Those values are what have guided me all through my life and we need to bring them forward into the 21st century. What in the losing manifesto was the best you ever stood on? For people on zero-hours contracts or in part-time work or who don’t get enough hours at work so they can bring home enough pay. We mustn’t throw all that away. Yvette Cooper’s pitch is that she’s the credible alternative Prime Minister, having been a minister for more than a dozen years, ending up as Gordon Brown’s Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. An economist who got a first at Oxford before studying at Harvard and the LSE, she married Ed Balls soon after she became an MP. If she’s the first woman elected to become Labour leader, it is her who will be the famous one. You keep warning Labour not to swallow the Tory manifesto, not to swallow Tory myths. Who is doing that and what are the myths? Well, I think we were too narrow and we have got to reach out. If we think moving a narrow party a bit to the left or a bit to the right is going to solve Labour’s problems, it won’t. We have to grow in all directions. Reach out to every corner of the country. Win back the Tory voters we’ve lost, but also the Ukip voters we’ve lost and the SNP voters in Scotland. The woman she has in her sights is Liz Kendall, who has never been a minister and was not even in Ed Miliband’s top team. What counts, Kendall says, is her experience in the real world. Like the other two, she was a young political adviser in the Blair years. But she’s the only one not afraid to speak up as an unashamed Blairite. I grew up in Watford, which is the sort of seat we need to win back and I represent Leicester West, which is the kind of seat we need to hold. We need to build a broad coalition of support. Yvette Cooper has warned Labour not to swallow the Tory manifesto. What she calls Tory myths. She means you, doesn’t she? Look, people will use all sorts of different labels in this campaign. I’m not interested in the strategy about where we are in September this year. I am interested in what we need to do to change our party to win the 2020. Last on the list is a veteran of protests about Iraq and austerity and much more besides. jeremy Corbyn was nominated today by many MPs who don’t agree with him and don’t even want him to be leader. Simply, they said, to widen the debate. I recognise that my views on austerity, on nuclear weapons, on a number of other issues are not in the majority of the parliamentary Labour Party. I entered this whole issue on the urging of some colleagues in Parliament and urging of others inside Parliamentjust to ensure there is that discussion, there is that debate. Believe it or not, on the very day we got the short list moods are growing to change the rules, to ditch the next Labour leader if they are not up to the job. Nick Robinson, BBC News, Westminster. The parents of two teenage girls who were crushed to death at the Hillsborough disaster have been hearing details of their last moments at an inquest into the deaths. 19-year-old Sarah and her 15-year-old sister Vicki Hicks were among the 96 people who were killed at the FA Cup semi-final in April in 1989. judith Moritz sent this report from the inquest in Warrington. This is the last time the Hicks family were together, a football match after a family picnic. Their arrival at Hillsborough picked out on blurry CCTV amongst thousands of others. And this was Trevor and jenny Hicks today, 26 years on, no longer a family and still searching for answers about how their two daughters died. Obviously this is when it gets very personal, so a tough three days for us. I can deal all day with the accountability issues, and every other issue, but when it comes to the personal stuff and it is very difficult. 15-year-old Vicky Hicks dream and of being a sports reporter. Her older sister Sarah, who was 19, was studying chemistry at university. This footage was taken by BBC cameras at Hillsborough and captures their last minutes of live. What followed this is too distressing to broadcast. As the crush worsened, Sarah clung onto Vicky with a look of terror on her face sobbing, ""Can someone help my sister?"" One witness says he found the 15-year-old unconscious with her arms outstretched like jesus on the cross. Trevor and jenny Hicks have spent more than a quarter of a century fighting to know every detail of what happened to their daughters. They’ve attended inquests and inquiries and have long campaigned on behalf of families bereaved by Hillsborough. None of that experience can have made listening to today’s harrowing evidence any easier to bear, and tomorrow Trevor Hicks will have to relive what happened as he steps into the witness box to tell the jury about the last time he saw his children. judith Moritz, BBC News, Warrington. Thousands of Syrians have fled fighting in the north of the country as Islamic State fighters struggled to hold a key town on the border with Turkey. It’s the latest in a series of setbacks for the jihadis in northern Syria. Kurdish forces, supported by US airstrikes, closed in on the town of Tal Abyad from the west and east, cutting off a vital supply line to the extremists stronghold of Raqqa. The latest reports from the Kurdish forces claim they have now taken the key border town. Our correspondent, Paul Wood, sent this report from the border. Syria’s war washes right up against the Turkish border. Or rather, its victims do. These people are fleeing the success of Western policy, the defeat of the so-called Islamic State in northern Syria. Their town was ruled by the jihadis. But now, Kurdish forces are closing in on it, backed by American bombing. As the battle got closer, they were stuck in no man’s land. IS fighters tried to force them back. For several days, the Turkish security forces would not let them cross. It is very hot, he says, they left people to die on the gates. Like most here, almost all Arabs, he is angry about the Kurds. They are doing every bad thing you can imagine, he says. This man says he doesn’t much like the Islamic State either. His wife disagrees. At least they won’t try to force us from our homes, she says. For shame, they shout at foreign journalists. They accuse the West of helping in ethnic cleansing. These people are fleeing from an Islamic State territory that is steadily shrinking. The jihadist have lost as many as 200 villagers. The combination of American air power and Kurdish fighters on the ground have simply warm them down. But IS is far from defeated. It has made gains elsewhere in Syria and in Iraq. It remains strong in its heartland. This man infiltrated IS as a spy for a rivaljihadi group. Many times, he watched orders being given to kill innocent people. IS will do anything to stay in power. But their current success is temporary, he tells me. You can’t rule by fear forever. It can conquer areas quickly, but it won’t keep them. Islamic State has lost this place. The Kurds deny they are forcing Arabs out to build a new state. The truth of that will determine whether these, the latest of Syria’s 3 million refugees, will be able to return to their homes. His father and his brother were both Presidents of the United States - now the former Florida governor jeb Bush - is hoping to follow in their footsteps. Tonight he’s launched his bid to become the Republican Party’s presidential candidate - but he’s up against at least ten other hopefuls. Our North America Editor, jon Sopel, is in Miami - jon. jeb Bush finished speaking about half an hour ago, a speech in which he sought to betray himself as the man for the dispossessed and those left behind -- man for the dispossessed and those left behind -- portray himself. He said nobody deserved the job of president based on their CV or their family background. May I present you the next President of the United States of America: jeb Bush. Stopping to give a kiss to his 90-year-old mother Barbara, he took to the stage for the announcement the audience had come for. Our country is on a very bad course. The question is, what are we going to do about it? The question for me is, what am I going to do about it? And I have decided, I am a candidate for President of the United States. He rounded on the failures of the Obama administration, Washington’s paralysis. He’s both about record of as Florida Governor of a man who got things done and the things he would achieve at the White House. We do not need another president who merely holds the top spot amongst the pampered elites of Washington. We need a president to disrupt the whole culture in our nation’s capital, and I will be that President. The campaign is up and running. jeb 2016. No mention of the Bush family name, because he is walking a tightrope, he wants to put distance between his older brother George, but wants to stay plugged into the formidable political network and the fundraising power it gives. The first thing you do is... Change presidents. The well fronted campaign was designed to frighten his opponents out of the race. He hoped to raise so much money that they would shy away. But that hasn’t happened, because they think that jeb is vulnerable and eatable. He is very rusty. I think the game has changed over the last 13 years since he last ran. You have Twitter and Facebook and social media, you have the 2l+-hour campaign where anything you say anything you do can be used against you the court of public opinion. On Saturday, we had Hillary Clinton the’s campaign launch, where she was supported by her husband and ex-hazard and Bill Clinton. The dynastic family on the Democratic side. -- dynastic family on the Democratic side. -- ex-president. Today it is the other Bush entering the race. The bushes are the nearest American thing to royalty. But this is not royal family and there is no automatic right of succession. jeb has got his work cut out. The President of Sudan has defied an attempt to bring him before the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide. Omar al-Bashir was attending an African Union summit in johannesburg when a South African court ruled that he should be prevented from leaving the country. But the Sudanese leader ignored them and has flown home. Our Africa correspondent Andrew Harding is here. So what now? It has not been a great day for internationaljustice. President Bashir is wanted on serious charges. He is accused of orchestrating a scorched earth campaign in Darvel. 300,000 people, mostly is the billions, were killed. 1.1+ million people were forced from their homes. The ICC Sea has been after him with that arrest warrant for six years. African leaders used to support the court, some still do, but the mood is changing. Not least because the court has only ever gone after Africans. There is the feeling that bias is there, perhaps races. They may well have a point, but there is also a bigger point. This is about a small club of African leaders innocents protecting each other. Tonight President Bashir is back in Sudan. The court has clearly had its credibility challenged. As for Africa, this agency... Country has held itself up as the moral compass of the continent. The government has openly and contemptuously challenged its own judiciary and setting a pretty awkward example to the rest of the continent. It’s a controversial process that has divided communities - now plans to use fracking to extract shale gas have moved a major step closer. Planning officers in Lancashire have recommended that the energy firm Cuadrilla should be allowed to begin fracking at one site near Blackpool. But councillors have to give their final approval next week. Our Industry Correspondent john Moylan reports from Lancashire. It is an ordinarily field in Lancashire in a region known for agriculture and tourism. But it is now the new fracking front line. They have refused Roseacre Wood and the new road. Protesters gathering outside the County Council today claim people in the region are being treated like guinea pigs by the fracking industry. The news that one site could go ahead was meant by stony silence and dismay. Both of them should be refused. It is bad for the environment, them should be refused. It is bad forthe environment, it for the environment, it is going to impact on climate change, and it is bad for the UK. They are going to start drilling all over the UK. This recommendation still has to be approved by the council next week. If it is, this farmland will be completely transformed into what the industry calls it fracking pad. Then in the autumn, exploration will begin. Rick will be erected here, they will drill to a depth of around two miles. Will be identifying exactly where the best shell rocks are, and fracking will begin. There could be up to 100 such sites in the years to come. We have spoken of between 80 and 100 sites across the entire Lancashire licence area. This is 1100 square kilometres. The totals of his area would be approximately two square government is. Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into shell rocks deep underground. That releases gas which has been inside for millions of years. There will be independent monitoring of air and water quality at the site and any seismic movement. Cuadrilla except it likely caused earth tremors when it fractured in the area in 2011. Those living nearby are not convinced. I think it is too close to residential places. This industry is untried and untested, and it is self regulated. We don’t want to take those kind of risks. We are trapped here because we can’t sell our houses. Nobody wants to buy them. The government wants the UK to go all out for shale. Today in Lancashire, that prospect looks much more likely. The 800th anniversary of Magna Carta has been celebrated by the Queen and thousands of guests beside the Thames in the river sorry. It originated as a peace treaty between King john and his barons. It was sealed at Runnymede where today’s ceremony took place. Monarchs were subject to the rule of law. It is widely recognised as the first charter protecting human rights and freedom. Nicholas Witchell was at the ceremony and sent this report. Not far from Windsor Castle, the centuries-old symbol of the Marnoch’s power, is the place where that power was curbed and the concept of human rights began. Its Runnymede, where this document, Magna Carta, was sealed by King john 800 years ago. Within these sentences were the guarantees which shaped many of the laws and basic rights by which we live today. Members of the Royal family were there to help celebrate the concessions forced out of an unpopular medieval predecessor. William Quist schoolchildren about their history. Have you learned lots about Magna Carta as well? Yes. Has that been quite interesting? And the Queen heard the Prime Minister said that Britain needed to regain control over human rights, a sideswipe perhaps at Europe. Here in Britain, ironically the place where those ideas were first set out, the good name of human rights has sometimes become distorted and devalued. It falls to us in this generation to restore the reputation of those rights and their critical underpinning of our legal system. But of course it wasn’t just this country which was influenced by Magna Carta. Its principles were embraced by the founding fathers of several other nations. It was the Magna Carta and its declaration about the rights of the individual which helped to shape the Constitution of the United States. It is a debt US leaders are aware of. While the hands that wrote the Magna Carta have long been stilled, the principles they carved out of the struggles of their day, of the struggles of the human condition.

Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. New figures reveal that for the first time ever, the average cost of renting in the capital has surpassed £1,500 a month. With demand for homes continuing to exceed supply, house prices in the London have also reached an all-time high, with the average asking price now more than £600. asking price now more than £600,000. Alpa Patel reports. Caroline lives in Islington. Like so many of her friends she has no choice but to share her home. And the fear that her rent may go up is never far from her mind. I’m 26, I live in a flat share, but that is completely normal. I talk to my friends who live in other places, like Manchester, and they are all looking to buy houses now and that’s not even a possibility for me. And I have a job and I earn a decent wage, but I am trapped in the renting system. I’ve had to leave places before because they’ve put the rent up and kind of priced me out of the house I was living in. You just feel unstable and insecure. And there’s nothing you can do about it. It is perhaps of no surprise to Londoners that that they are paying the highest rents in the country. The reason why these figures are so head-line grabbing is because the average rent in London has broken £1,500 a month mark. Rents have increased across the country too. On average a tenant now pays £935 a month. The factors behind the rise are familiar to us - rising demand and a lack of supply. Like Caroline, many of us would like to buy. There’s not good news on that front either. According to the property website Rightmove, the average price of a home in Greater London is now more than £600,000. That’s a record high and a rise of more than £30,000. So what is driving the demand and how long will it last? There’s a very strong economic backdrop, particularly in London, which is the strongest performing region in the country. We have a lot of immigration coming in, so demand is going up. Coupled with that, we’ve got very few homes actually for sale in the capital. People are not putting their homes up for sale because it is a good asset to hold on to. So, we have few buyers competing for not many properties. It is driving up prices. London’s population is expected to rise to 10 million over the next 15 years. The fear is, unless more affordable housing is made available, thousands like Caroline will not only struggle to pay the rent but face being priced out of London all together. More than 70 firefighters have been tackling a blaze in a row of shops in Hackney. The fire, believed to be caused by a freak accident, broke out in a wood joiners this afternoon and quickly engulfed the shop and flats above. Nine people were safely evacuated from the building. One man was taken to hospital suffering from burns and smoke inhalation. It’s the fastest growing sector in London and employs around 200,000 people. Some of the rising stars in the digital technology industry are being celebrated during London Tech Week - which got underway today. There are also calls for further financial support and better connectivity to keep the capital at the forefront of digital development. Victoria Hollins reports. Need a place to park in London? This man, well, his app can help. So imagine you turn up on the location and then you sort of can search around, so it tells you the rules on single yellow lines and the restricted hours. You can see areas where it is free to park. He’s part of a growing number of start-up digital tech companies in the capital. London is a test-bed for this product. There’s nowhere else as complex as London. We track London and we can expand out. Some of the rising stars of London’s tech scene came together at the digital centre on the Eastern Road this morning. The aim is to drive the country’s best ideas. You need to click it on to the back of the smartphone and using the app you can stick it in your ear and capture images and videos of your ear drum and send that purely through our remote platform to doctors and specialists. But there are challenges for tech’s bright young things here. Most start-ups would say that funding is the biggest concern. I think there’s been great progress with investors’ appetite for risk and investing in early-stage companies. Think they needs to improve. The London technology class has become a de facto thing for London. It is not something which is happening in East London and let’s try and boost it. It is here and here to stay. What for the future? There’ve been more technology investment projects in London than anywhere else in recent years, contributing to a sector worth £18 billion a year to the economy. The challenge is to enthuse the next generation. What do you want to do? That fell to the mayor at a teaching centre in Camden this morning, learning to code. What we want to see is London companies going from being just, you know, modestly sized, perfectly-formed entities to the kind of billion-pound giants that the Americans have. Computing is now on the school curriculum. Many specialist centres like this one have had to close. That could undermine London’s desire to become a tech-sector leader. When your children go to school they are being deskilled. They use computers at home and mobile phones. When they get to school, they use a pen and paper. We think it is really important that children have the access to technology, use it the best way possible. The capital is not quite Silicon Valley yet. London Technology Week does prove you don’t have to look across the Atlantic to find the innovators of the future. That’s it from me, so I’ll say goodnight. And leave you with Wendy Hurrell with a look at the weather. Not too bad this week. A lot of people will be happy unless you are trying to grow things because there will be a lot of people taking water cans about this week because it will be very dry. This is how the temperature trend is looking. Not too bad tomorrow. We willjohn Majortop 25-26 Celsius somewhere on Wednesday, before it settles down towards the end of the week and to start the weekend. That is because we have a cold front going through on Thursday.

Northumbria Police say they were called to a house early this morning, after reports that a newborn boy had been bitten by a terrier. Our correspondent, Danny Savage, is there. Yes, it was just after first light this morning when we understand the baby’s mother found this morning when we understand the baby’s motherfound her badly injured son as she carried out a routine night-time check. Everyone we have spoken to said, the dog involved had a good temperament. It is quite obviously did not and now a young family is mourning the loss of a newborn baby. This is three-week-old baby Reggie, found badly injured in the early hours of this morning after being attacked by his family’s pet dog. Police were called to his home in Sunderland shortly after loam. Shocked neighbours have been leaving flowers here throughout the afternoon. They had all met with the new arrival in the street in recent days. A really bonny lad. She was showing us him at the beginning of last week. He was a lovely bairn, really was. What do you make of what happened? It is a shock. It is a shock more than anything else. I can’t get over it. Police have spent the day examining the home and garden. The dog involved is described as being a small terrier, which detectives have taken away and is being kept in kennels. A relative of the little boy told us the dog was usually kept in a brick outhouse in the back garden and he cannot understand why it was in the house last night. He did say the animal has always had a good temperament and was always well- behaved around the other children in the home. The dog is a terrier type - a small terrier type - family pet. Not a dog you would associate with being a dangerous animal. Family members have briefly visited the home this afternoon as investigations continue. A 30-year-old man, understood to be the baby’s father, has been arrested and is being questioned by detectives following this shocking death. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in London to protest against austerity. It’s the first large-scale demonstration since the General Election. Our correspondent Tom Symonds has been following the march. They’ve filled the streets from the Bank of England. Organisers claimed 250,000 protesters were there, some had to queue up to March. There were thousands of placards, thousands of opinions, and one key demand, an end to posterity. We have to balance our books but to the detriment of our people? No. They should support people who are disabled and deaf people. We should have equal rights and that is why we are here today. This is the largest protest since the election result with austerities very much part of the campaign. People are here for a variety of reasons, many of them public-sector workers. They say it is a battle against austerity which will go on for a generation. Austerity is unnecessary and we’re not going to have it. A watching supporter did not doubt what he called the earnestness of the protesters. But... We need to crack on with it. We are spending more than we bring in full yesterday, figures had us at £1.5 trillion in debt. Some came in black, masked, and with fireworks. At one point, they broke away from the main march and tried to block roads. Policing was light and there was little trouble. Protesters accepted that, however well supported, accepted that, however well supported, marchers rarely -- marches rarely change policies but they promised there would be more. And in Glasgow, thousands of people have also attended a rally to protest against austerity. The Scotland United Against Austerity event took place in George Square. The organisers said the vast majority of the people in Scotland did not vote for the Conservative government- and they questioned the legitimacy of its cuts. Fresh photographs have emerged that appear to show the gunman accused of shooting dead nine people in an church in Charleston in the United States. The pictures from a website appear to show 21-year-old Dylann Roof holding a gun and a confederate flag and burning the American stars and stripes. BBC News has learned that the British man killed fighting for the terrorist group Al-Shabab in Kenya was one of the leaders of an attack on a military base. Thomas Evans, from High Wycombe, was the group’s cameraman, and filmed the raid in which he died. Our East Africa Correspondent, Karen Allen, reports from Mpeketoni in Northern Kenya. Apparently pictured in this Al-Shabab video, Thomas Evans, the British fighter, in hisjungle hideout. These images capture him before he was killed in a thwarted attack on Sunday. But we now know he spent time on the other side of the lens. He was Al-Shabab’s cameraman. Filming and firing his weapon until the moment he died. He was commanding, ""Shoot this one, don’t use that firearm. Use the other one."" The video was on. Taking any movement and action. And the shooting of soldiers. The grim task of identifying bodies under way. Thomas Evans was among 11 Al-Shabab fighters killed, as they tried to storm a military base. The Briton was said to be the second-in-command. That camera and Thomas Evans’ high-calibre machine gun are now in the hands of the intelligence services as investigators try to build up a profile of Britain’s first-ever Al-Shabab fighter to be killed here in Kenya. They will want to know whether he had contact with other foreign fighters, where his networks were, and who he took orders from. Police here suspect Thomas Evans had actually struck before, after he slipped into Kenya unnoticed last year. This is the aftermath of an Al-Shabab killing spree in which more than 70 people died. Survivors described seeing a light-skinned man among the gunmen. This local barber caught a glimpse of him meters away from a rooftop. This guy was standing close to a pick-up. There was a pick-up behind. He was standing behind that. He had a gun on his back. But he has this, do you call it a laptop? He had a laptop. He had not even covered his hair. What colour was his hair? I would say brown, like your hair. Thomas Evans may be the first British Al-Shabab fighter to be killed in Kenya. With about 100 other known recruits it is feared he will not be the last. Two members of the Red Devils parachute stunt team have had a lucky escape after their parachutes became entangled - in mid-air - during a display in Cumbria. Both men plunged into water at a marina, unharmed. Today they have been talking about their experience, as joe Lynam reports. A routine stunt that went wrong. This is a moment two red Devils collided with each other. The two men seemed out of control. Years of training and quick thinking saved the day. One sky driver but in the other Posner parachute, they guided each other into the nearby harbour. I looked up. Straightaway we realised it was not how we planned to do it. Then the training kicked in. We’re always trained for every eventuality. We implemented a plan we always have in the back of our minds. On the ground, things looked quite serious for a few heart stopping moments. You could see them wrestling to get control. One has is to have an incredible piece of skill. It was about 700 metres from the original drop son. It was breathtaking to watch. Everyone expected a tragedy. They pulled it off and it was incredible. This is what the spectators at the Whitehaven show were hoping to see. Skydivers from The Parachute Regiment stacked on top of each other in a spectacular display. Will this put them off? We have a full season ahead of us. Fortunately, no 1 was injured and the red Devils will be back in action tomorrow. For now, one para says he owes the other a drink. A pint of beer, maybe. That’s it for now. Now on BBC1, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE A three-week-old baby has died after being attacked by a dog. The little boy was bitten by a terrier at home in Sunderland. New pictures emerge of the man charged with shooting dead nine black worshippers at a church in South Carolina. Tens of thousands march against government plans for billions of pounds of cuts. And the luck of the devil. How two of the Army’s elite parachute team escaped this mid-air entanglement. I looked up, seen the parachute was a little bit wrapped around, so pretty much straightaway you realise it’s not exactly how we planned to do it. Good evening. A three-week-old baby has died after being attacked by a dog in Sunderland. Northumbria Police say they were called to a house early this morning after reports that a newborn boy had been bitten by a terrier. Danny Savage reports. This is three-week-old baby Reggie Young, found badly injured in the early hours of this morning after being attacked by his family’s pet dog. Police were called to his home in Sunderland shortly after loam. Shocked neighbours have been leaving flowers here throughout the afternoon. They had all met the new arrival in their street in recent days. A really bonny little lad, cos we seen him, they showed us him at the beginning of last week. He’s a lovely bairn. Well, he was. What do you make of what happened? It’s a shock. It is, it’s a shock more than anything else. You can’t get over it. Police have spent the day examining the home and gardens. The dog involved is described as being a small terrier which detectives have taken away. This evening a relative of the family told us the dog was usually kept in a brick outhouse in the back garden at night and he couldn’t understand why it was in the house. He was too upset to be interviewed but he also said, as far as he was aware, the dog was always well-behaved around children. The dog is a small terrier-type family pet. It was the family pet from the home. So not a dog you would associate with being a dangerous animal. Family members have briefly visited the home this afternoon as investigations continue. A 30-year-old man understood to be the baby’s father has been arrested and is being questioned by detectives following the shocking death. New photographs have emerged of the white gunman accused of killing nine black worshippers at a church in Charleston in the United States. The pictures from a website show 21-year-old Dylann Roof posing with firearms and burning the American flag. Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from Charleston. New images of Dylann Roof paint a chilling picture of the 21-year-old. He’s seen here brandishing a gun, a Glock A5, the same type police say was used in this week’s attack. These images show him at sites in and around Charleston associated with this area’s history of slavery and its divided racial past. When he was here, he’d just... He’d be sleeping right here. Roof’s friends showed me around the trailer a few hours from Charleston, where he’d been staying in the run-up to the shooting. They told me he’d talked about attacking the university the week before but they never believed he’d go through with it. He told us the church wasn’t his primary target. That’s why my heart goes out to those families because you guys weren’t the targets. What does that mean? He wanted to shoot the school up UCA, Charleston. He just stopped talking about it. He never said anything else about it. He wasjust, like, they’ve all got seven days to live. A week later, charged with nine counts of murder, Roof appeared before a judge by video link. He is now in solitary confinement as he awaits trial. Tonight floral tributes continue to arrive. The police tape has now been removed from outside the church. Some things remain untouched, like this sign advertising Sunday service led by the reverend, one of the victims. Tomorrow, the church will reopen for a small private service in honour of those who lost their lives. Tens of thousands of people have taken part in anti-austerity marches in London and Glasgow. They’ve called for the Government to halt planned cuts to public services, which ministers say are needed to reduce the deficit. But to Nike Iain Duncan Smith and George Osborne have repeated their intention to reduce benefits by thousands each year. -- intention to reduce benefits by thousands each year. -- but to night. Our correspondent Tom Symonds has the details. They filled the streets from the Bank of England, the City’s financial heart, towards Westminster, the centre of political power. The police no longer estimate protest numbers. The organisers claimed 250,000. Some had to queue up to march. There were thousands of placards, thousands of opinions, and one key demand - an end to austerity. We have to balance our books, but at the detriment of the people, no. There’s got to be some way around it. We’re here to support people who are disabled, and deaf people, we want equal rights. That’s why we’re here today. I think a lot of people have given up. It’s not that they want austerity, it’s that they’ve given up fighting it. This is the largest protest since the election result, with austerity very much part of the campaign. People are here for a variety of reasons, many of them public-sector workers. But they say that this is a battle against austerity that will go on for a generation. Austerity is not the only option. It’s unnecessary, it’s unethical, and we’re not going to have it. A watching supporter of austerity didn’t doubt what he called the earnestness of the protesters, but... The honest truth is we need to crack on with it. We’re still spending £75 billion a year more than we bring in. just yesterday new figures had us at more than ÂI.5 trillion in debt. Some came in black, masked and with fireworks. At one point, they broke away from the main march and tried to block roads, but policing was light, there was little trouble. Protesters accepted that however well supported, marches rarely change policies, but they promised there will be more. Tom Symonds, BBC News, Westminster.

Greece has said it will offer new concessions to its creditors in a last-minute attempt to unlock billions of euros desperately needed by the country. The announcement comes ahead of an emergency EU summit on Monday. As Greece teeters on the edge, our correspondent james Reynolds reports on the mood amongst the people. The safest assets in Greece may also be its most unaffordable. It is 55,000 euros for this. Celia’s family has run this jewellery shop for four generations. She’s learned how to negotiate for a deal. She fears that her government has not. I wouldn’t do it like this. You wouldn’t do it? No, I would like to be more safe, more, you know... Stability? Stability, yes. I don’t like to gamble and to be so tough. ""Safety first"" works for many other Greeks as well. This week account holders have withdrawn several billion euros from the country’s banks. The cash withdrawals are dramatic and the warnings about leaving the euro are now increasingly real. But Greece has still found a way of getting on with normal life. After half a decade living with constant crisis, this country has developed a certain apocalypse fatigue. So where better to take a short break? This lunchtime, this beach south of Athens was full. The sun may have influenced the mood. TRANSLATION: I don’t worry because everything will work out, as always. We’re optimistic. Greece always makes it.

The husbands of two of the women from Bradford, who are thought to have taken their young children to Syria, have made an emotional appeal for their return. Akhtar Iqbal and Mohammed Shoaib broke down in tears as they pleaded with their wives to come home. There’s been no news of the three women, who are all sisters, and their nine children for almost a week. They’d taken the children, aged between three and 15, to Saudi Arabia on a pilgrimage. But instead of coming home, they flew to Turkey. Danny Savage is in Bradford. It would be a hard-hearted person not to sit through this afternoon’s news conference and feel compassion for the men. They believe their wives and children are in Syria, a world away from life in Bradford. They made a direct appeal to the wives today to bring the children home. My report contains flash photography. Playing on a swing in a park in Bradford, children enjoying time with their father. But when will he see them again? These are three of the nine youngsters who it is feared have been taken to Syria by their mothers.

Some of the children were pictured at Manchester Airport on the day they left, looking excited about the trip as children do. They were off to Saudi Arabia apparently with no idea about the ultimate destination and who was paying for it. The trip abroad would not have taken place had they known that anything like this would have taken place. There are grave concerns about how they managed to purchase the tickets to Istanbul.

Everybody I have spoken to today is shocked about what this family appears to have done. How can three mothers take their children from a stable community and country to a war zone? It is not the right place for anyone to be. What about the mums taking their children? You hear it all of the time what the people... It is a hellhole. I miss you. It has been too many days. I don’t know where you are. Please, please come back home. There are suggestions police were in contact with the families of the children because their uncle had gone to Syria. If they are there, it will be virtually impossible to get them back. The elephant in the room is the brother of the three mothers who it is believed is in Syria. Was he the reason they went? Did he financed the trip for them to join him? It is a sensitive subject and the family did not want to be drawn on it today. All the fathers would say today is they had no contact with the brother-in-law. They have had not had anything to do with him for a long time. There is no trace of the family in Turkey. They do not know anybody there. The obvious conclusion to draw is they have travelled from Istanbul to the Syrian border and crossed there. If thatis Syrian border and crossed there. If that is the case, the fathers are in a helpless situation. Thank you. One of the victims of the Alton Towers rollercoaster crash has told the BBC that she thought she was going to die. 20-year-old Vicky Balch is still in hospital two weeks after the accident at the theme park in Staffordshire. She sustained such serious injuries that she may have to have one leg amputated. She has described the excruciating pain she suffered as she was trapped on the ride for more than four hours after the accident. Her words are spoken by an actor. It felt like slow motion. We banged into the car in front. I felt the bar going to my knees. The car went into us again. I passed out. Vicky Balch was on the front row with her boyfriend. Everyone was screaming and I was in excruciating pain. I could see blood all over. The bars were in my right knee. My only thought for the hours we were stuck was that we were going to die. If I was going to survive, I would never walk again, that was certain. I thought it was never going to end. Vicky has some very nasty leg injuries and it is fair to say she is fighting as we speak to survive with one of the legs, to avoid amputation. She potentially could also lose a leg? Regrettably, she could. 17-year-old Alia Washington was also in the front row. Her left leg has been amputated above the knee. Herfatherwatched leg has been amputated above the knee. Her father watched the rescue attempts on television -- knee. Her father watched the rescue attempts on television -- Leah. One of the parents was watching on television, knowing their child was on the ride. They could see the child on the ride. That is very difficult for them to live with. They are still coping with that image. Leah’s boyfriend said they had been forced to get off the right twice before it began so that staff could carry out checks. He said that the carriage stopped held on one of the loops for around 20 minutes. When it finally set off again, it collided with an empty carriage. The lawyer says it has been a nightmare for the families but he has been humbled by their response. Stunned, initially. And good, initially, that this could happen in a fiend Park -- angered, initially, that this could happen in a theme park. They want answers. It may depend on what the answers are and the investigation. It is very well to say that we must move on with our lives. But if it reveals holes in terms of training, people being flippant with safety, I think that anger will reignite. Paul Paxton, the lawyer for many of the Alton Towers victims, speaking to me earlier. Six students from Ireland have died after a balcony collapsed at a block of flats in California. It’s thought they were at a party in the American university town of Berkley when it came away from the side of the building and crashed to the ground. Eight people were injured. From California, David Willis reports. The 21st birthday celebration was under way when shortly before 1am in the morning, the fourth floor balcony of this apartment building collapsed and landed on the balcony below. Six people were killed, seven others seriously injured. All of the dead were from Ireland, students it is thought in the Californian coUege is thought in the Californian college city for the summer. Fellow Irish students here are in shock. We knew someone who was there, they are OK. Everyone is pretty shocked. Our thoughts are with the families back home. It isjust thoughts are with the families back home. It is just a tragedy, horrible. I came out at midnight and Isil all of the rubble on the ground -- and I saw. People in tears. I would also like to send my condolences to everyone back home. Addressing the Irish Parliament, the Taoiseach said he was heartbroken. I confirm a number of young Irish citizens have lost their lives while a number of others have been seriously injured. It is truly terrible to have such a serious and sad incident take place at the beginning of a summer of adventure and opportunity. Of the 13 people on the balcony at the time of the collapse, all of them were Irish. Of the seven in hospital, several are thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries. The Irish president has said a message of condolence to the families of those involved. Michael Martin also paid tribute to those whose lives have been taken from them in what he called the beauty of an American summer. The former deputy editor of the News of the World has denied that he knew about the phone hacking activities of the paper’s royal editor, Clive Goodman. Neil Wallis is giving evidence for the first time at his trial for conspiracy to hack voicemail messages. He told the Old Bailey he was receiving treatment for depression. New figures show that inflation has returned to the British economy after a short period of falling prices in April saw it fall to minus 0.1% in April- its lowest level since for 55 years. One of the biggest factors pushing up inflation in May was the price of petrol which has bounced back since its low point earlier this year. Our economics correspondent, Andy Verity, reports. It was petrol that drove inflation below zero and it is petrol that is making it take off again. The Bank of England told us to enjoy deflation while it lasted. Blink and you missed it. If you want to know about the price of petrol, ask someone who really cares. This 1930s sports car, shown off at the Brooklands Motor Museum in Surrey, now costs nearly £600 to fill up - £60 more than in February. Nice when it came down. I hope it doesn’t go back up as high as it was before, but I’m sure it will. If I can avoid thinking about it at all, because I use quite a lot of it. I have a business that relies on me doing some milage and I stopped doing things because it got so high. Unleaded petrol has jumped 11p from its low point, to £1.17 a litre. That was one of the biggest factors pushing the Consumer Prices Index up by 0.1%. Stripping out food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, core inflation is up 0.9%. Throughout the time since these cars were built, the Bank of England almost always wanted less inflation. Now it thinks we need more of it, not least because of our debts. If you borrowed £1,000 in 1962 to buy this car new, that would have seemed like a big debt. But by 1980, it didn’t seem like so much because prices and earnings had gone up with inflation, but the amount you borrowed hadn’t. Inflation shrinks your debts, but if you don’t have enough inflation, that goes into reverse and your debts hang around. Inflation is in many ways a jekyll and Hyde character. It diminishes the value of money which is bad news for savers. But for borrowers, it also diminishes the value of debt. For the government, it erodes public debt. So, pI’oS and COIâ1S. A little bit of inflation is good for the economy because it means the economy is growing. Petrol is still cheaper than it was a year ago, but that is unlikely to be the case by the end of the year. Expect inflation gently to accelerate. The time is Almost 6. 15pm: Our top story this evening.

EU ministers have EU ministers are holding talks on how to respond to the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean. So far this year, more than a 100,000 people have made it from North Africa to Europe. Most of them have landed in Italy and Greece, but they say it’s unfair that they’re having to shoulder the burden of the crisis. The EU is planning to distribute asylum seekers more evenly among member states. But a row between Italy and France - over the fate of more than 200 Africans, stranded on the border- showsjust how difficult it is to resolve. Lucy Williamson reports from the Italian town of Ventimiglia. failed to reach agreement Having reached the shores of Europe, these migrants have found the gateway blocked, the French border isjust a few meters away, but they’re not being allowed across. A punch in the face of Europe. Italy has called it. With numbers here building today the Italian police began to move the migrants back further inland. It’s not what Italy or the migrants want. The Italian police had their orders to clear some of the campsjust here by the French border. You can hear the kind of resistance they’re up against. Women and children now being loaded onto buses to take them back into Italy. Among them was this 19-year-old with his family. Clinging to his mother and 10-year-old sister to resist the eviction. They are acting with us like terrorist, animals, like we come from another planet. There are no human rights here. Italy says its being left to shoulder this burden alone. EU ministers met today to discuss sharing Europe’s migrants people them but the idea has met stiff resistance and Britain has said it will opt-out. Migrants are frog marched back into Italy by French police. Italy’s borders are open. 20 minutes later we see the same group marched across the border again by the same French police.

The father of two teenagers who died at the Hillsborough football stadium disaster has told an inquest how he battled to save their lives as they lay on the pitch. Trevor Hicks said he moved back and forth between Sarah who was 19, and her 15-year-old sister Vicki as he tried to revive them. judith Moritz reports. They used to be in a family of four, but Hillsborough took both of their children from them. Today, Trevor Hicks came to court with his former wife, jenny, to tell the jury about the day their daughters died. You know, it’s 26 years, but we’re still coming to terms with it. I’ve said before, I’m a chipped cup and I’ll always be a chipped cup and that will never change, regardless of what happens here. The family watched the match from different parts of the ground. This photograph shows Trevor shouting for help when he realised that a crush was developing in the area where 15-year-old Vicki was standing with Sarah, who was 19. Both girls were pulled out of the crowd and laid on the pitch where their father found them. BBC cameras captured Trevor Hicks as he went backwards and forwards giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to both of his daughters. He lifted Vicki into this ambulance and turned to put Sarah in too, but before he could another casualty was put into the last space. Trevor was faced with an awful decision, whether to leave with Vicki or stay with Sarah. He said today, ""I felt dreadful. I had no choice, I appreciate that, but it doesn’t stop you feeling dreadful about it."" The girls’ father went with Vicki thinking Sarah would quickly follow in anotherambulance, he later learnt that she had died. Despite the efforts of medics at hospital Vicki was also pronounced dead. How difficult is it to relive that? To put yourself back there? Well, I’ve relived that hundreds of times. I’m just voicing it this time. It goes on in my head regularly. As you know I had PTSD for quite a while. Sometimes, when you wake up in the morning, or you’re trying to get to sleep at night it always comes back. Trevor Hicks has spent years campaigning for those bereaved by Hillsborough, now the jury has heard about his own personal tragedy. Trevor Hicks painted a vivid picture of the anxiety he faced as a father at Hillsborough. The jury will also hear a mother’s perspective as jenny Hicks prepares to give her own evidence to these inquests. judith Moritz, BBC News, Warrington. Tory eurosceptic MPs have won fresh concessions from the Government over rules for the EU referendum due to be held in 2017 at the latest. The Government has reassured them there will be limits on what ministers can do to back a Yes vote. Our deputy political editor, james Landale is at Westminster. james. Now, David Cameron wants to lift the usual restrictions and allowed the Government to campaign hard for one side of the argument. Some MPs think that might be unfair, potentially leading voters to question the legitimacy of the result. There has been a standoff. Today the Government have made some kind of concessions. They have promised the Government won’t get involved in mass mail shots, emails and advertising campaigns, things like that. They have said the referendum will not take place on May 5th next year where it would clash with a whole load of other elections. That is not enough for some MPs. They are voting against the Government, as we speak, trying to get the Government to change its mind. The Government won’t be defeated, but this might sound technical, not necessarily that exciting, it does matter. That’s because this is the first real battle of wills between David Cameron and his backbenchers. If the rebellion is large, then there is trouble ahead for Number Ten. If the rebellion is modest it might reveal that David Cameron’s opponents are quite not so numerous and perhaps so well organised as some have claimed before. james, thank you. The American businessman, Donald Trump - whose fortune is valued at $9 billion dollars - has announced he will seek the Republican presidential nomination. In a speech delivered from his skyscraper Trump Towers in New York, he promised to make the United States great again and said he was the only candidate who could fix the country. 12 republicans have now announced they’re running for the election in November 2016. Al-Qaeda in Yemen has said its war on the United States will continue after its leader was killed in an American airstrike. In a video a spokesman confirmed that Nasser al-Wuhayshi died in a drone attack last week along with two other militants. The Yemeni branch of Al-Qaeda was behind the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris injanuary and an attempt to blow up an American passengerjet on Christmas Day in 2009. The Greek Prime Minister has accused international leaders of trying to humiliate his government and the people of Greece. He told members of parliament in Athens that demands for further deep spending cuts were politically motivated. European officials have been meeting to try to resolve the crisis. America’s First Lady, Michelle Obama, has visited a school in East London as part of a two-day tour to promote education for girls. During the day she also met Prince Harry at Kensington Palace to discuss support for military families and she had tea with the Prime Minister in Downing Street. Reeta Chakra barti reports. It’s not every day the US First Lady comes to visit, it’s not every day she gets a reception like this. # No matter, ‘cause there’s Something inside so strong.# Michelle Obama choose an East London girls school to come and promote her cause of education for all. It was a message that clearly everyone wanted to hear. Inside, in a speech strong on empathy, Mrs Obama told the packed hall that as a black woman from a humble background she and her young audience had a lot in common. In so many ways, your story is my story. For those of you who may not know much about my background, I grew up in a working-class neighbourhood on the south side of Chicago. A neighbourhood a lot like this one. Where people work hard to make ends meet, but where families are tight-knit with strong values. Her official theme was a multi-million-pound partnership between the UK and the US to support teenage girls’ education globally, but she also had a personal message for the largely Muslim pupils. Maybe you read the news and hear what folks are saying about your religion, and you wonder if people will ever see beyond your headscarf to who you really are instead of being blinded by the fears and misperceptions in their own minds. Her husband’s had his political ups and downs, but that’s not stopped Michelle Obama from using her profile, her influence and her undoubted charisma to highlight the issues close to her heart. At the end the woman recently nicknamed the hugger-in-chief lived up to her reputation. These pupils got to meet her and got hugged too. Meeting Michelle Obama was amazing. I mean, we could relate to her so much and sometimes there is that distance, and today that distance was bridged. It’s very difficult sometimes to see ourselves in positions of power later in our lives, but she represents that how far that hard work and determination can take you in life. From the East End to the West End where another warm welcome awaited the First Lady, even if it was a little more sedate. Reeta Chakrabarti, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Darren Betts. A shame we were stuck indoors today. This was what we missed. This was the scene on the south coast, 19 degrees. It was warmer inland in London, some places could be warmer still tomorrow, not everywhere. The weather is changing. Very little cloud across England and Wales a different story for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Rain and drizzle will develop widely this evening in Scotland. As the rain sinks southwards overnight there will be little rain for Northern Ireland and northern England. Most will come into Cumbria. Low cloud to southern parts of the UK and it will be a warm night. The rain will move southwards tomorrow. It will be halted for a while across Northern Ireland. A wet start to the day, so too across southern Scotland, rain to the north-west of England. Not much crossing the Pennines. The rain will sink southwards, there will be sunshine towards the south-east. The rain will move southwards. It’s on that weather front. I put the temperatures on, behind the rain to the north, the rain clears away, there will be cloud, showers to the north-west, we are in the cooler, fresher air, top temperatures only 16 or 17. The fresher air, top temperatures only 16 or17. The rain 16 or 17. The rain not far away from Trent Bridge for the one-day international at Nottingham. The heat should building to the south after a slow start. Temperatures could be in the mid 20s. It will be cooler where we keep the cloud in Wales and parts of the south-west. The rain will slide southwards tomorrow evening, most of the rain peters out, we are left with a gentle north-westerly air flow for Wednesday. There will be more cloud in Scotland, drizzly showers to the north. Elsewhere, much more sunshine for Northern Ireland and across England and Wales. It will feel pleasant, not as warm in the south-east perhaps. A lovely day for Lady’s Day and dry weather for most of us as we head into Friday. The main stories.

It should come more from the parents, they should have more say. Teaching unions welcome any new support and training, but... We have been here before and there are more fundamental questions that need to be answered. If class sizes go up, that tends to link to worse behaviour. So, the education secretary also announced today more GCSE reforms. Every secondary people must study five core subjects and a good pass will be harder to achieve. This new behaviour in force will make sure kids get every chance to do that. Before becoming a teacher, Tom Bennett worked here as a nightclub bouncer will stop keeping the peace required good communication skills, a no-nonsense approach, and at times a pretty long views. Not so different from teaching a class full of children. When I started teaching, especially the older children, they looked terrifyingly tall. They look like aduh terrifyingly tall. They look like adult to me. If you are not used to standing upfor adult to me. If you are not used to standing up for yourself, if you are not used to being assertive with other assertive people, you can often find yourself in a submissive position. He wants to make sure that every teacher has the training and skills to deal with modern challenges. A working group will listen to views and recommend changes which he hopes will make this kind of behaviour a thing of the past. Plenty more to come, including: A council strikes back after a rise in Star Wars themed street entertainers. A couple from Essex who had their baby girl wrongly taken away from them say they’re still fighting forjustice. Thurrock Council took Misty Barnes into care in 2012 over concerns about her safety, but wrongly accused her father of being a suspected terrorist and a convicted armed robber. Misty was returned after a judge found social workers had made serious mistakes. Her parents have been speaking to Alpa Patel. What is that? She was only one-month-old when she was removed from her home by social services. Now two, Misty Barnes seems blissfully unaware of the battle had parents have fought to get her back. She spent ten months with foster parents, including her first Christmas. Ten months her parents say they can never get back. We missed everything. Her being our first... First smile, first roll over, first set up. We had to read in a contact book how she is doing, she hasjust started rolling over, she has just started she hasjust started rolling over, she hasjust started pulling herself up. We missed herfirst proper steps. We didn’t get to push her in a pushchair. Sorry. Money is silly... Misty Barnes was taken from her parents in 2012 after Thurrock council wrongly accused her father of being a terrorist. In some temper 2013 a judge ruled that there was no evidence that she was at risk. In October 2013, evidence that she was at risk. In October2013, Misty October 2013, Misty Barnes was reunited with her parents. The council have apologised to the couple in private, and offered them compensation. They declined an interview with us today, but said if the family are still not satisfied then they should approach their local government ombudsman. They stressed that their actions had always been in the interests of the child. In a statement, the couple’s MP said: The couple, although relieved to have their little girl back, say they will not stop until they get a public apology and a full public inquiry. The battle for City Hall will see Labour’s mayoral hopefuls setting out their vision for the capital tonight. They’re taking part in the first hustings since party chiefs approved the shortlist of six possible candidates at the weekend. Let’s get more from our Political Editor Tim Donovan who’s in Westminster. Yes, it will be. We have had the time trials, the practice laps, we have known who these candidates will be for some time, but this is the race starting properly. A think tank is holding these first hustings this evening, the first of several over the next few weeks. There are six key people on this short list. One is a former MP, Tessa Chow, regarded as the favourite at this stage. There are also existing MPs such as Diane Abbott and Gareth Thomas. There is another transport journalist making up the six. Quite a long short list, but they all got enough nominations from the local Labour parties in London to justify this selection. During this hustings in Westminster they will be focusing particularly on housing, which has emerged clearly as the number one issue for most of these candidates. They will have them a section on London and the rest of the UK. A burning issue here about tax revenues, how much is raised in London and how much is put into infrastructure. And then the issue of economy and welfare, and finally environment, and transport. Whilst we know the positions of a number of these individual candidates come what is interesting during a series of hustings is how they interact with each other. Now, of course, it looks as though the Conservatives will have a high-profile candidate of their own. Zac Goldsmith, yes, he looks like bringing a high-profile candidate to this contest. Next Tuesday will be when he confirms, and he will only do so if the people of Richmond Park say that they approve. There is polling suggesting today in the Evening Standard that Tessa Chow would defeat him, but if Siddique Khan was Labour’s candidate, it would be neck and neck. Tim, thank you. Scotland Yard is investigating A5 allegations of electoral malpractice following the recent mayoral election in Tower Hamlets. Voters went to the polls on 11th june after the previous Mayor, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office after being found guilty of corrupt and illegal practices. Police have released an image of a bogus landlord suspected of defrauding potential renters of £20,000. The man posed as the landlord of a flat in Islington in September 2014. Prospective tenants handed over large deposits, only realising that they had been the victims of a scam when they arrived on their moving date. A man from Lewisham has beenjailed for burglary after he was filmed on a camera installed by a BBC wildlife presenter. Nigel Batton was caught on a wildlife camera installed in a home in Herne Hill, set up to film urban animals. He was convicted of burglary and attempted burglary and jailed for 4.5 years. A former newspaper executive, on trial for phone hacking, has told the Old Bailey how he was ""very close to Scotland Yard"". Neil Wallis, who was Deputy Editor of the News Of The World, said he had good relationships with a number of former Met Commissioners. Richard Lister has sent this report from court. Today, the court heard details of a statement that Neil Wallis gave police in October 2013, and in that statement he claimed the police were being extraordinarily vindictive in continuing what he called a campaign of persecution against him. He described this as police payback for the campaign that Neil Wallis said he had led against what he called the Met’s abuse of the arrest process, and its campaign to shackle the British press to the intimidation ofjournalists. By this stage, when he was making this statement, NeilWallis stage, when he was making this statement, Neil Wallis had spent 19 months on police bail, a process he said had caused him irreparable harm. As he took the stand today, he was emotional as he recounted the impact that he said this process had had on him. In particular, the mental impact it had had on his wife and son. NeilWallis mental impact it had had on his wife and son. Neil Wallis that he had also been suffering depression as a result of the stressed that was caused during this period. The prosecution claims that Neil Wallis knew of and encouraged voice mail interception while he was at use of the world. Those points were not put to him directly today, but in his statement he dismissed them as lies, and he will continue giving evidence here tomorrow. You may have seen them around Trafalgar Square - suspended statues, many of them along a Star Wars theme. They’ve started to appear alongside the more traditional street performers that we’re used to seeing in London tourist spots. But recently the competition between them has got so intense that Westminster council has had to get involved. Gareth Furby explains. It is 6am in Trafalgar Square, and a man is already here to claim his place on the pavement in front of the National Gallery. TRANSLATION: I come here to occupy my place because there are about 15 human statues, and some of them whether same outfit. There are five that I know of, and yesterday they all came to claim a spot. By 7am it is starting to get each crowded. The trolleys carry the friend that they use. There were ten people doing this, and now there are 30, and even more at high season. Soon after 9am, the frames go up. Of course, there are other characters, but four of them on this day work Yodas. Most of the human statues come from one city in Romania. But some other street performance in Trafalgar Square say all this competition is now causing problems. It is shocking. It is very territorial. A lot of people become aggressive because it is their spot. When they disagree, they start fighting. While we were filming, a street artist was asked to move. Although we don’t know who buy. TRANSLATION: They want to control the square, they want to make the money. As some of the characters are from Star Wars, this may yet be dubbed Yoda Wars, but one man insists it is not serious. We only have fights with people coming to still our spot. Many tourists may enjoy this site. It is crazy that you cannot see his feet. Westminster Council says that over the next couple of weeks it is hoping to trial a system of kitsch cried and is, with the aim of striking a better balance for everybody. Still to come tonight: Selling silks for 140 years - now Liberty’s fabrics get their own exhibition. Will the warmth last until the weekend and the longest day of the year? As we’ve been hearing, it’s been a special day for a girls’ school in Tower Hamlets, who received a visit from America’s First Lady. Michelle Obama got a rapturous welcome. She was there to meet the staff and students as part of a two-day tour to promote education for girls, and paid tribute to the east London school. ~ I want to thank all of the students here, the smart, powerful, creative, accomplished young women of Mulberry School for Girls. You all look beautiful, and you’re welcome is touching. Well, two of the students from Mulberry School for Girls who met Michelle Obama join me now. Thazmeen Zanem and Nusrath Hassan, and with them, Deputy head teacher jill Tuffee. Lovely to meet you all, thank you so much for coming in. We heard just a short clip there, and she was certainly inspiring. What was she like for you? If I could sum up the day in three words, she is inspirational, motivational, and she made us all feel so valued. It is an experience I will never forget. For me, I was able to host the event with the first Lady. It was an experience that most students from the school will remember, not only students but the community as well. There was such emphasis on how it is important to have the committee together for students to reach their potential. You were lucky because we can see some footage again, and you were walking alongside her. Yes. That must have been quite an honour. It was. She is such an inspiration, and to have her here, it is a school that values women’s education, and looks up to such inspirational women to motivate us. To see that, we cannot let our limitations stop us from reaching our potential. What did she say to you when you were walking along? I remember she said she was so excited to get to know the students will stop that made me feel so valued. She already knew so much about our school already. She was so impressed with the students and the teachers. The enthusiasm is wonderful. When America’s first lady PHYS wonderful. When America’s first lady pays a visit to your school, it is no ordinary day, is it? No, what a huge honour it was for us to be hosting the first Lady of the United States at Mulberry School for Girls. She is one of the greatest inspirational women of our time, I think. I think her belief in the transformative nature of education is exactly what our school is about, and I am so proud to be here with two wonderful students of ours, who really are and example of our education. Why is Michelle Obama a role model for you? She has had to face some of the barriers that we face in our own lives, social and economic barriers, and when you see somebody like that, and you see they have gone so far and achieved so much, that gives you hope. If she can do it, I can do it. You look up to them as a role model. It is easy to see people on television or on radio, but to see them in real life is different, it is such an honour. Do you feel that you can relate to her in some way? I definitely think we can. In her speed she said she came from an ethnic minority background, she grew up in Chicago, and she is a female. It is something that most students can relate to. She did say that education for girls is the ultimate key to success. Do you know what career path you are both planning to take? I have got a fairly good idea. I plan to study geography at University, and then I would like a career in politics. I would like to study law at University and follow in the footsteps of Michelle Obama herself. I would like to practice law for a feud years, and then hopefully work in public service. It is certainly a special day. Thank you so much for coming in. Thank you. Thank you for having us. Next month, 7,000 sportsmen and women from around the world will gather in Los Angeles for the Special Olympics for athletes with learning disabilities. Among those going for gold is a 25-year-old dressage rider from Barnet, who was paid a surprise visit by her sporting idol before she sets off for the US. Chris Slegg has more. Meet Georgina and her training horse. Next month, she will represent Great Britain in dressage at the special Olympics in Los Angeles. For now, that means hours of hard work. Her equestrian skills have changed her life. My balance and ordination on the ground is not all that. But on a horse it is a sense of freedom. Natasha Baker is one of Great Britain’s most successful Paralympics of all times. She won two gold medals in London 2012, performances which saw her become an inspiration to many, including Georgina. What Georgina was not expecting was for Natasha to come and watch her train. Hello! How are you? A perfect opportunity to get some coaching tips. Good! That was really nice. If I canjust say one thing that is different or give her one piece of advice when she is UP her one piece of advice when she is up there riding and that takes her forward and she just gets one extra mark in that test, hopefully that could be a big difference between a medal or no medal. Georgina has been riding since she was four. Riding brings out the best in her. It has empowered her to be able to communicate. It has empowered her to have a very meaningful life. I am proud that she has achieved what she has achieved so far, and we just hope she goes out to LA and enjoys herself. A day to treasure for Georgina, and there could well be another in Los Angeles. It’s one of London’s best loved department stores, and for decades Liberty’s distinctive designs have set trends and influenced leading players in the fashion industry. Now, one of the largest private collections of its fabrics is to go on show in a major exhibition at London’s Fashion and Textile Museum. Here’s our Arts Correspondent, Brenda Emmanus. The outlook on clothes are the new generation throughout the Western world, Mary Quant... She was not only an instrumental figure in London fashion during the 1960s, but Mary Quant also made use of another London success story, Liberty department store. Their famous rings inspired her designs, as they did a host of fashion designers past and present. I think there are two strands to Liberty. There is the fabric side and the retail side, and they are closely linked. The key person was Arthur Lazenby Liberty. He must have been a mixed ordinary man, a huge energy. He started the shop withjust man, a huge energy. He started the shop with just three employees. 20 years later, key had 400. He had a clear vision for his central London store. He declared that he was determined not to follow existing fashion, but to create new ones. At the heart of the brand is the printed fabric, which has become a key source and originator of trends throughout fashion history. As they celebrate their 140th anniversary, a new exhibition will take days at the fashion and textile museum, which will chart the evolution of the brand, and reflect their strong relationship with designers from the 1800 to the present day. This is typical art nouveau import array, and this is a dress made by Mary Quant in the 1960s with their famous floral print. It is read the first exhibition looking just at the Liberty fashion, so either fashion that Liberty produced or sold, or influenced by other designers. It covers every decade. Artists and writers were all fans. We believe there is a resurgence of interest in making clothes, manufacturing, and we hope that Liberty will inspire a new generation of designers to engage with their traditional prints and create sets of designs for the 21st century. 140 years old, and as popular as ever, liberty and fashion opens in October. Now, the weather. A beautiful day today, glorious conditions. It was lovely and warm, but not too close and sticky. Tomorrow there will be a change to thing because it will become very warm and start to feel a little more humid. We go into this evening with those beautiful, fine conditions. There is a bit of cloud drifting around. As we go through the night, there will be a lot of clear sky, but it will be a fairly mild night. Temperatures will remain in double figures across the Home Counties, and we will feel the benefit of that tomorrow morning. Once again there will be bright skies, cloud from time to time, and some sunny spells. More of a breeze blowing in, but generally the air will be warmer and a bit more humid. Temperatures up to 23 degrees across the Home Counties. I think this 24 for London is conservative, and we could reach 96 Celsius. Rain heading in towards the evening. It is a cold front. What we have had through the last couple of days is high pressure, which is why this section of the UK is under those fine conditions. It is holding the cloud and rain back, but this cold front will come through and it will have a slight effect on the temperatures. So, 26 degrees for Celsius, and as it sweeps through it will freshen up a little bit to 23 degrees for Thursday. This is how it is looking towards the end of the week. We will have lovely sunny skies on Thursday. Slightly less humid as well. Then we knocked back a little bit on temperatures for Friday, but there is still some sunshine around. Average damages for the weekend, some cloud and rain. Wendy, thank you. Now the main headlines: The husbands of two sisters from Bradford who are believed to have taken their children to Syria tojoin Islamic State have asked them to return home. The two women, and a third sister, have disappeared with their nine children.

Tonight, the woman at the centre of the biggest storyline in Albert Square. She’s made her way up west from the East End to the One Show Studios. Please welcome actresss Samantha Womack. APPLAUSE You film it all completely out of sequence. Yes, we do. Do you watch EastEnders to keep up to date with what other characters are getting on with? I don’t watch anything I do now. I immerse in the experience and move on and don’t look back. It’s not really for me. It’s for everyone else. That’s a very good point. It’s a very health yay preach. We won’t give it all away. She’s trying to solve a mystery. Yes. There’s some CCTV cameras involved. As you do. Lovely. Normal. Ilike CCTV cameras involved. As you do. Lovely. Normal. I like them in my fridge. If I could put one anywhere, I would. My boys are like locusts. just a lock would work. She sets up cameras to find out if her husband is, now what’s the term, ""woulding"" -- wooing my sister. She’s trying to catch it on CCTV. just a hint. More mysteries solved tonight when we reveal the identity of this strange animal spreading confusion in the countryside. Any clues? Mike’s here and he wants to know, so if you have spotted an animal and have no idea what it is, send your photos to the usual address: Now, it’s that time of year that many parents dread. Exams are coming to an end and young people want to celebrate with a holiday or festival, without mum and dad. That can cause a bit of tension, let’s face it. Alex Riley’s been allowed out on his own to hear some stories on the streets of Glasgow. Going out clubbing, you might be having the time of your life. But spare a thought for your parents, they might be worried sick. Would you be OK with your daughter going to a music festival? Yeah, so long as I was with her! You’d be happy for her to go, as long as she took her mum with her? Yes. Do you think she’d like that? No. What sort of things really worry -- she’d like that? No. What sort of things really worry -- worried your parents? Going out too late, not coming home, maybe someone kidnapping you. They make up silly things. When you were going to the festivals, what did your parents think? At first, I suppose they were worried. But I can handle myself. Go with a big group of friends, it’s fine. What’s she up to, what on earth is she doing? I hope she’s behaving. Does she phone you to re-assure you everything is all right? Sometimes, she couldn’t get any worse than I could. I think to myself, she must be no bad. Had a bad experience, but... What happened? I wasn’t feeling well on the Sunday and had to go home. Mum, I’m not feeling very well, can you come and get me, please. Aye. You tell them the stories that they’re allowed to know. You don’t tell them what they can’t know. Would you follow in the shadows with a pair of binoculars? No, that’s a bit- you do give them a bit of space and a bit of a life. You a few years yet. You wouldn’t enjoy it if you went now. We always keep binoculars handy in case the Baker steps out of line. Edith is with us now. Nice to see you. You’ve written a bobbing all about British music festivals. -- written a book all about British music festivals. Do you think a festival is a good place for teens to experience independence for the first time? Ido. I didn’t have the luxury of festivals when I was a teenager. I came to them in my early 20s, when I was starting to work. My first experience at festivals was working at them. Especially things like Reading, it’s one of those festivals where kings phone up and get their GCSE results as they’re -- kids phone up and get their GCSE results when they’re going in the gates. You have a 14-year-old. 19-year-old -- gates. You have a 14-year-old. 19-year-old --19-year-old step son and a 14-year-old. You’re alienated from everything else, in social media. You’re in a bubble that is family, friends and music. It’s hard when you know what goes on. This programme has gone out about suspicious parents and what their offspring is getting up to. It’s that strange thing of you experiencing something and not wanting your children to go through the same hardship. I remember my mum, she was 19 when she had me. We’ve always been really close. She was always very encouraging to experience in life. That kind of thing you’ll learn from your mistakes, you’ll discover things as you go along. That kind of approach is a healthy way to be. Writing the book was like that. It reminded you of going, I had forgotten all about that. Why? Probably because I was having too good a time. That was a really good way of looking at when ",,

The group of 12 from Bradford were due to come back from a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia last Thursday. The children are aged between 3 and 15-years-old. Two of the fathers have now made an appeal for their safe return. I miss you, it’s been too many days. I don’t know where you are. Please, please come back home. We’ll have the latest from Bradford where the families are waiting for any response to the day’s appeals.

On BBC London: Dealing with disruptive pupils - a former teacher and bouncer is the Government’s new behaviour tsar. And Labour’s mayoral hopefuls set out their vision for the capital. Good evening. The husbands of two women from Bradford, who are thought to have taken their young children to Syria, have made an emotional appeal for their families to return home. Khadija, Sugra and Zohra Dawood - who are all sisters - and their nine children - aged 3 to 15 - have been missing for a week. They’d travelled to Saudi Arabia for a pilgrimage, but instead of coming home last week they flew to Turkey. Our special correspondent, Lucy Manning, is in Bradford tonight. We saw today two fathers who did not, in fact could not, hide their emotions. Heartbroken at the thought that their children are missing, possibly heading to Syria. They feel that they have lost everything. Their message - that they have lost everything. Their message - a simple one. Come home. This piece contains some flash photography. love you. All of you, I love you a lot. I can’t live without you. The young, happy faces of his children, a world away from Syria, from danger, and now from their father. I’m shaking and I miss you, it’s been too many days. I don’t know where you are. Please, please come back home. So we can live normal life. Please. Please come back home. Their young cousins are also missing. Their father racked with grief. Please come back. My son said, ""I miss you so much."" They are young kids, seven and five. And I love you so much. We had a lovely family. I don’t know what happened. The family’s missing after they didn’t return from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia last week, instead flying to Turkey. Sugra Dawood and her five children, Khadija and Zohra Dawood and neighbours can’t believe the two little ones might be in Syria. It is disgusting. They had a little house, they had a home, they had a life, they were happy little children. Why do that? Why uproot all the world and take them into a place where they are not safe? This is the Dawood’s main family home. There was also a brother who grew up here, who it is now believed is in Syria and the lawyer for the father’s appeal to him if the women and children are there, send them back home. It was in the knowledge of the authorities, if it was, that the brother was in Syria, then this family should have been monitored by the authorities. There were smiles then, where today there are only tears. Children supposed to be kept safe, potentially heading to a country thatis potentially heading to a country that is far from that. The BBC understands from sources here in Bradford that the brother who it is believed had gone to Syria some time ago is Ahmed Dawood. The lawyer for the fathers refused to deny there had been some police involvement with the family once the brother had gone to Syria, so that is a possibility. And also the fathers have questions about how their wives were able to afford to buy all the family tickets to Turkey, but that one big question that they have just where are their children. European Union member states have failed to reach agreement on a plan to get all EU nations to help deal with the thousands of asylum-seekers crossing the Mediterranean every week. So far this year, more than 100,000 people have made it from North Africa to Europe - and more than half of them have landed in Italy where the crisis is putting a huge strain on resources. Our correspondent, Lucy Williamson, sent this report from Ventimiglia on the Franco-Italian border. Getting here used to be the difficult bit. Now, leaving Italy is becoming just as hard. The French border isjust a few metres away. But these new arrivals aren’t being allowed across. A punch in the face of Europe, Italy has called it. With numbers here building, today the Italian police began to move the migrants back further inland. It’s not what Italy or the migrants want. The Italian police have their orders to clear some of the camps just here by the French border. You can hear the kind of resistance they are up against. Women and children are now being loaded on to buses to take them back into Italy. Among the targets today was this man, clinging to his mother and ten-year-old sister, to resist the eviction. They are treating us like terrorists, like animals, like we come from another planet. There is no human rights here. Migrants caught sneaking over the border are frogmarched back by French police. A game of ping-pong as one aid worker put it, with migrants as the balls. Upsetting, says Ventimiglia’s Mayor, because France has always been a friend. TRANSLATION: If we are all in the EU and the European Community, there needs to be solidarity and the ability to work together. This image can’t be the one we portray to the world today. This is notjust a matter for governments, we tend to blame governments, but it’s a question for the European populations. EU Ministers met to discuss sharing Europe’s migrants between them. But there’s resistance among some member states. Britain has already said it will opt out. And Italy fears being left to shoulder this burden alone. Unable to stem the flow of migrants in, or to offer them a route out, transit camps like this one now dot Italy from top to toe, in Sicily, Ventimiglia and in Rome. And today, hundreds more came tojoin them, rescued from a wooden barge and a dinghy off the Libyan coast. Among them, 90 women and children, each one saved from the Mediterranean Sea, a drop in Italy’s own ocean. Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Ventimiglia. Our correspondent, Damian Grammaticas, is in Luxembourg, where that meeting of EU Ministers took place earlier today. Was there any sign of progress at all today? A little bit. An agreement that all countries should help out Italy and Greece. The real difficulty is, what those Ministers were talking about today is a fundamental change to the way Europe deals with this issue. Instead of asylum-seekers being processed and housed in the first country they arrive in, for the first time they are talking about Europe taking those asylum-seekers and sharing them out. What you have is, particularly the newer, relatively poorer Eastern European countries - Poland, Hungary, the Baltic states - worried about the cost, worried about how migrants who don’t want to go to certain countries would assimilate and also worried they don’t want to be seen to having quotas forced on them. Thank you. In California, a fourth-floor balcony packed with partygoers has collapsed, killing six people and seriously injuring seven others. At least five of the dead were students from Ireland in the US on visas that allow young people to work and travel over the summer. The cause of the collapse is unknown. Our correspondent, David Willis, has the latest. A 21st birthday party was under way for one of the Irish students when the fourth floor balcony collapsed and landed on the balcony below. 13 people were celebrating when the structure broke loose and tipped forward, spilling victims on to the pavement beneath. Ireland is a small country. When you have the numbers that we had here today, very few of us have been left untouched by this tragedy. Five of the dead were 21-year-olds from Ireland. Fellow students are in shock. Our thoughts are with all the families back home, really. It is such a tragedy, like. It is horrible. I came out at midnight and I saw all the rubble on the ground and just Irish people crying, in tears. I would like to send my condolences back to everyone back home. Addressing the Irish Parliament, the Taoiseach said: I confirm a number of Irish citizens have lost their lives while a number of others have been seriously injured. It is truly terrible to have such a serious and sad incident take place at the beginning of a summer of adventure and opportunity. Of those taken to hospital, several are thought to have suffered life-threatening injuries. This woman paid tribute to the young people who lost their lives. 27 Conservative MPs have rebelled against the Government on the detailed plans for an EU Referendum. Euro-sceptic MPs had demanded safeguards to ensure that taxpayers’ money couldn’t be used to campaign for a ""yes"" vote in the final stages of a referendum campaign. Ministers won tonight’s vote in the Commons, but they had to rely on opposition MPs. Our Deputy Political Editor, james Landale, is at Westminster. What did today’s events tell us? Today was the first parliamentary smirmish between David Cameron and his MPs in the new session. I think what we saw was the Prime Minister arguing that he wants to suspend the usual rules for the referendum, so that the Government can campaign for one side of the argument at the end. Some of his MPs and other parties think that will make the referendum unfair. What happened was that the Prime Minister threw all the stops att Prime Minister threw all the stops at t ensured there were concessions and in the end kept the rebellion down to a baremy mum. Significantly none of the new MPs voted guest the Government. Doer bare minimum. But if Labour had voted with the rebels, Parliament would have lost. David Cameron might have a proper mandate for the first time, but it will be constrained by Parliament. Thank you very much. One of the victims of the rollercoaster crash earlier this month at Alton Towers theme park has been telling the BBC about the moment the accident happened. Vicky Balch, a 20-year-old dancer and student, is among five people being treated for serious injuries. Her leg may now have to be amputated. That’s according to lawyers. Sophie Raworth has spoken to the lawyer I’âpI’âSâI’ItiI’Ig SOITIE of the victims. Captured on camera, the momentsjust after the two carriages collided. Writing from her hospital bed, Vicky Balch described for the first time what happened. Her words are spoken by an actor. It felt like slow motion. We banged into the car in front. I felt the bars go into my knees. We moved backwards and the car went into us again and I passed out. Vicky was in the front row of the carriage with her boyfriend, Daniel Thorpe. Everyone was screaming and I was in excruciating pain. I looked down and I could see blood all over. The bars were in my right knee. The only thought that was going through my mind for the hours and hours that we were stuck was that we were going to die. If I was going to survive, I would never walk again, that was certain. I thought it was never going to end. Ijust wanted to die. Vicky has some very nasty leg injuries and I think it is fair to say that she is fighting, as we speak, to survive with one of the legs to avoid an amputation. So she potentially could also lose a leg as a result of this accident? Regrettably, she could. 17-year-old Leah Washington was also in the front row. Her left leg has been amputated above the knee. Her father watched the rescue attempts on television. One of the parents was watching on television as well, which added to the trauma and, for sure. Knowing that their child was on that ride? Knowing, they could see their child because of the clothing on the ride. Now, that is very difficult for them to live with and I think they are still coping with that image. Leah’s boyfriend, joe Pugh, said they’d been forced to get off the ride twice before it began, so staff could carry out safety checks and during the ride he said their carriage stopped, held on one of the loops for around 20 minutes. When it finally set off again, it collided with an empty carriage. Their lawyer says it has been a nightmare for the families but he has been humbled by their response. Stunned initially, angered initially, that this could happen in a theme park, designed for pleasure. But, thereafter, yes, as I say, they do want to know answers and actually it may depend on what those answers are in the investigation, because it is all very well to say - now we must move on with our lives, but if the investigation reveals great holes in terms of training process, people being flippant with their children’s safety, I think that anger will reignite. Merlin Entertainment, which owns Alton Towers, said the crash was the first accident in the company’s history and they have assured all those involved that they will receive compensation. The television and radio presenter Chris Evans has been named as one of the new presenters of Top Gear, following the departure ofjeremy Clarkson. Chris Evans - who’s signed a three-year deal to present the show - said he was ""thrilled"" and that Top Gear was his ""favourite programme of all time"". The BBC hasn’t yet named the other members of the presenting team. The latest official figures show there’s been a return to inflation after a short period of falling prices in April. More expensive air fares made the Consumer Price Index rise very slightly to 0.1% in May. Our correspondent, Andy Verity, has more details. It was petrol that drove inflation below zero. And it’s petrol that’s making it take off again. The Bank of England told us to enjoy deflation while it lasted. Blink and you missed it. This 1930s sports car, shown off at the Brooklands Motor Museum in Surrey, now costs nearly £600 to fill up, £60 more than in February. Nice when it came down. I hope it doesn’t go back up as high as it was before. I’m sure it will. If I can avoid thinking about it at all because I use quite a lot of it. My business relies on me doing some mileage. I stopped doing things because it got so high. Unleaded petrol has jumped 11p from its low point to £1.17 a litre. That was one of the biggest factors pushing the Consumer Prices Index up by 0.1%. Stripping out food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, core inflation is up 0.9%. Throughout the time since these cars were built, the Bank of England almost always wanted less inflation. Now it thinks we need more of it, not least because of our debts. If you borrowed £1,000 in 1960 to buy this car new, that would have seemed like a big debt, but by 1980, it didn’t seem like so much because prices and earnings had gone up with inflation, but the amount you borrow hadn’t. Inflation shrinks your debts, but if you don’t have enough inflation, that goes into reverse and your debts hang around. Inflation is, in many ways, a jekyll and Hyde character, so it diminishes the value of money, which is bad news for savers, but for borrowers it also diminishes the value of debt and for the Government it erodes public debt. Petrol’s still cheaper than it was a year ago, but that’s unlikely to be the case by the end of this year. Expect inflation gently to accelerate. Andy Verity, BBC News, Weybridge. The father of two girls who lost their lives in the Hillsborough football disaster in 1989 has been telling the inquests how he tried to save them. Trevor Hicks, who’s been a prominent campaigner for the victims’ families, described how he’d tried to save his daughters’ lives as they lay on the pitch. Our correspondent, judith Moritz, reports from the inquests in Warrington. They used to be in a family of four, but Hillsborough took both of their children from them. Today, Trevor Hicks came to court with his former wife, jenny, to tell the jury about the day their daughters died. It is 26 years but we are still coming to terms with it. I said before I’m a chipped cup and I’ll always be a chipped cup and that will never change, regardless of what happens here. This photograph shows Trevor shouting for help, when he realised that a crush was developing in the part of the terrace where teenagers Vicki and Sarah were standing. Both girls were pulled out of the crowd and laid on the pitch where their father found them. Trevor Hicks went backwards and forwards between his daughters, trying to resuscitate them both. He lifted Vicki into this ambulance and turned to put Sarah in too, but there was no room. The father of two was faced with an awful decision, whether to leave with Vicki or stay with Sarah. He said today: Trevor Hicks went with Vicki, thinking Sarah would quickly follow in anotherambulance. He later learned she had died and despite the efforts of medics, Vicki was also pronounced dead. How difficult is it to relive that, to put yourself back there? Well, I have relived that hundreds of times. I’m just voicing it this time. It goes on in my head regularly. As you know, I had PTSD for quite a while. Sometimes when you wake up in a morning or trying to get to sleep at night, it comes back. Trevor Hicks has spent years campaigning for those bereaved by Hillsborough. Today he told his own story. Trevor Hicks painted a vivid picture of the anxiety he faced as a father at Hillsborough and the jury will also hear a mother’s perspective, asjenny Hicks prepares to give her own evidence to these inquests. The prime minister of Greece, Alexis Tsipras, has accused international creditors of trying to ""humiliate"" Greece and its people by demanding new spending cuts and failing to agree on a renegotiation of Greece’s debt. The chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, said today she remained ""dedicated"" to do everything possible to keep Greece in the Euro. Our World Affairs Correspondent, james Reynolds, is in Athens. What is your reading to how close to agreement or collapse this is? I think they are stuck, Huw. The gap between Greece and its creditors is now being filled with accusations. The Prime Minister told Parliament earlier today the IMF’s fixation with cuts, as he called it, was most likely part of a political plan to humiliate an entire nation. Those words and the lack of progress at talks may lead some European leaders to now seriously consider the possibility that Greece may default on its loans and be forced to back UP on its loans and be forced to back up and leave the euro. But there are a number of meetings to go before we get to that point. Eurozone Finance Ministers will talk in Luxembourg on Thursday. EU heads of government will talk next week. The ultimate deadline is at the end of the month. So there is plenty of negotiating time left in the next few days. We are not quite at high noon yet but we are at high, late, late morning, waiting to see if anyone blinks. Thank you very much for bringing us up-to-date. America’s First Lady, Michelle Obama, has met Prince Harry and David Cameron on the first day of her visit to the UK to promote her charity work. Earlier today she visited a school in east London, where she encouraged girls to have ambition and said her own background was very similar to theirs. Reeta Chakrabarti was there. It’s not every day the US First Lady comes to visit, it’s not every day she gets a reception like this. # No matter, ‘cause there’s something inside so strong # Michelle Obama choose an East London girls’ school to come and promote her cause of education for all. It was a message that clearly everyone wanted to hear. Inside, in a speech strong on empathy, Mrs Obama told the packed hall that as a black woman from a humble background she and her young audience had a lot in common. In so many ways, your story is my story. For those of you who may not know much about my background, I grew up in a working-class neighbourhood on the south side of Chicago. A neighbourhood a lot like this one. Where people work hard to make ends meet, but where families are tight knit with strong values. Her official theme was a multi-million-pound partnership between the UK and the US to support teenage girls’ education globally, but she also had a personal message for the largely Muslim pupils. Maybe you read the news and hear what folks are saying about your religion, and you wonder if people will ever see beyond your headscarf to who you really are, instead of being blinded by the fears and misperceptions in their own minds. Her husband’s had his political ups and downs, but that’s not stopped Michelle Obama from using her profile, her influence and her undoubted charisma to highlight the issues close to her heart. At the end the woman recently nicknamed the hugger-in-chief lived up to her reputation. These pupils got to meet her and got hugged too. Meeting Michelle Obama was amazing. I mean, we could relate to her so much and sometimes there is that distance, and today that distance was bridged. It’s very difficult sometimes to see ourselves in positions of power later in our lives, but she represents that how far ",,
104,BBC1 London,16-jun-2015,BBC London News,22:25,10 mins,True,"Good evening, I’m Riz Lateef. The Government has appointed a new ‘behaviour tsar’ to help advise teachers on how best to deal with disruptive pupils - as too much lesson time is being lost to bad behaviour. Tom Bennett, who’s an east London teacher, was also a former Soho bouncer. Here’s our Education Reporter, Marc Ashdown. This BBC documentary is called Tough Young Teachers, and many in the profession will agree these days you need to be tough. The Government calls low-level bad behaviour the curse of the classroom. Now, this man has been drafted in to stamp it out. When a child refuses to obey an instruction in class, many teachers don’t know what to do. That’s a shocking state of affairs. Usually a teacher does not want, for example, to be mean or to be too tough with the child, but it is not being mean to set boundaries that will help them succeed in the future. These pupils are demonstrating the sort of behaviour he means - using their mobile phone in class, messing about on their chair, making silly noises or comments. It is estimated this costs an hour of lost teaching every day, or 38 entire days in the school year. Parents we spoke to are broadly in favour of zero tolerance. You don’t want the teacher to be standing for half an hour waiting for the lesson to begin. Sometimes you do have to have a nanny state stepping in. It should come more from the parents, they should have more say. Teaching unions welcome any new support and training, but... We have been here before and there are more fundamental questions that need to be answered. If class sizes go up, that tends to link to worse behaviour. If the curriculum isn’t engaging, that tends to lead to worse behaviour. So, the Education Secretary also announced today more GCSE reforms. Every secondary people must study five core subjects and a good pass will be harder to achieve. Her new behaviour enforcer will make sure kids get every chance to do that. Before becoming a teacher, Tom Bennett worked here as a nightclub bouncer. Keeping the peace required good communication skills, a no-nonsense approach, and at times a pretty long fuse. Not so different, he says, from teaching a class full of children. When I started teaching, especially the older children, they looked terrifyingly tall. They looked like adults to me. If you are not used to standing up for yourself, if you are not used to being assertive with other assertive people, you can often find yours elf in a submissive position. He wants to make sure that every teacher has the training and skills to deal with modern challenges. A working group will listen to views and recommend changes which he hopes will make this kind of behaviour a thing of the past. Marc Ashdown, BBC London News. A couple from Essex who had their baby wrongly taken into care say they’re still fighting for justice. Misty Barnes was removed by Thurrock Council after her father was falsely accused of being a terrorist. She’s now back with her parents who say they want a public inquiry. The council has apologised to the family. In the battle for City Hall- Labour’s six mayoral hopefuls have tonight been setting out their vision for London in the first hustings of the contest. Our Political Editor, Tim Donovan, was there. So, what did we learn this evening? Well, the main thing we learnt overall is that the key challenges is going to be differentiation, how do you show you have got that unique selling point without making unrealistic pledges which people don’t believe? It was the first time these six had appeared together. It is clear already that Tessa jowell and Sadiq Khan, the perceived front-runners, will come under particular pressure. There was a lot of focus on housing, Sadiq Khan promised 50% affordable in new developments and a new lettings agency. Tessa jowell said she would create a homes for London agency, bringing the top experts on housing together to deliver housing. Diane Abbott questioned the amount of affordable housing on the Olympic Park. David Lammy said he would consider building on the greenbelt and wanted to raise money through bonds for affordable housing. He accused Tessa jowell of showing a lack of ambition. The scale of my ambition is not too low. We need at least 40,000 homes. How? How? Well, there is enough brownfield land in London to build at least 250,000 homes. Tim, was Heathrow expansion mentioned at all? It was because Sadiq Khan today, or earlier on today, said that he would oppose a third runway at Heathrow whatever the Davis Commission recommends. It is expected at the end of this month. He said on environmental grounds. David Lammy took issue with that, saying this was not the position of Sadiq Khan a few years ago. Concerns around air quality, concerns around noise, concerns around whether the infrastructure can support it. My view is, the way to proceed is no third runway at Heathrow Airport, a better Heathrow, not a bigger one. He was for Heathrow expansion in 2008. He was for it when he was Transport Secretary in 2009. Zac Goldsmith’s announced he’s running and suddenly he’s against it. Gareth Thomas was very clear that he supported an extra runway at Heathrow and at Gatwick. It was about the jobs that were created. Christian Wolmar is going to be pitching his environmental credentials, he was against Heathrow, he wanted to see 20mph speed limits in London and so on. Diane Abbott, against Heathrow expansion, but also making a big play about devolution, taking over control of health spending. Thank you. That’s it from me, so I’ll say good night and hand you over to Wendy Hurrell for a look at the weather. Lovely today, wasn’t it? Really gorgeous conditions. It was quite fresh but warm enough. Tomorrow, it will start to feel a little bit different, very warm for some of us, and with that higher humidity as well. We go into tonight with plenty of clear skies. There will be a bit of cloud towards dawn. All in all, it will be quite a mild night, compared to what we have seen so far thisjune, with many of compared to what we have seen so far this june, with many of us thisjune, with many of us in double figures. We will feel the benefit of that first thing. We will start with a fair amount that first thing. We will start with a fairamount of a fair amount of cloud. There will be some sunshine getting through as the afternoon goes on. A little bit more of a breeze tomorrow, but temperatures will do very nicely, 22, 23 Celsius across the Home Counties, we might top 24 Celsius somewhere across London. You can see this rain showing up towards the end of the day. That will move through and freshen things up on Thursday. It is worth mentioning that tomorrow, across the South East, very high pollen levels. Let’s take a look at the outlook. Friday also looking like a fairly decent day with more cloud over the weekend. Hello. It was a lovely warm day for many of us today. It could get warmer tomorrow. many of us today. It could get warmertomorrow. But warmer tomorrow. But not everywhere. The weather is showing signs of change. The cloud very innocuous across England and Wales. We have seen more cloud spilling into Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here, we have seen some rain and drizzle. Not very much, the rain as it moves southwards will tend to peter out. A bit of rain for North West England. Increasingly, low cloud spilling into the southern areas, mist and hill fog will push its way through the Bristol Channel. This rain tomorrow moves southwards. The rain sets in for a while across Northern Ireland, southern Scotland, then moves down into Northern England, most of it across the North West, towards Wales. Ahead of it, we should get some breaks and sunshine. I’ll run that rain sequence again. The rain is on this weather front. Whilst the rain moves southwards, it clears away from Scotland and Northern Ireland by the afternoon. There will still be a lot of cloud. Here, we have some cooler, slightly fresher air so temperatures of 16 or 17 at best. The rain is not far away from Nottingham by late afternoon. The fourth one-day international takes place tomorrow. By late afternoon, we could start to see some rain. It will be warm ahead of that. The real warmth and humidity will be ahead of that across the Midlands, East Anglia, towards the South East, 26 degrees is possible. Where we keep low cloud, it will be quite a bit cooler. This is the weather front bringing the rain. That will move south tomorrow evening. Patchy rain, nothing very much. Then we have got this north-westerly airflow on Thursday. So, more cloud for Scotland, some showers for the north, but otherwise it will be dry. Much more sunshine for Northern Ireland, England and Wales. That sunshine will be strong. Maybe not as much sunshine on Friday. More cloud spilling in on a gentle north-westerly. The best of the sunshine towards the South West. Again, in the sunshine, it will feel pleasant. As we head towards the weekend, a lot of uncertainty, partly because of what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical Storm Bill is heading into Texas, bringing ten inches of rain. It will buckle the upper flow, buckling the jet stream, and that will have ",,
106,BBC1 London,17-jun-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,30 mins,True,"Wages go up at their fastest rate since the economic crisis, say official figures out today. On average, pay went up by 2.7% in the three months to April, compared with last year, and unemployment falls too. We’ll be asking whether people really are feeling better off. Also this lunchtime... RBS says around 600,000 payments have failed to enter its customers’ accounts, and the delay could last til Saturday. Swiss officials investigating Fifa say they are looking at 53 instances of possible money-laundering. The new presenter of Top Gear, Chris Evans, has been talking about his new role. It’s the biggest shadow ~ -- it’s the biggest television show in the world, it’s my favourite show of all time, you know how much of a fan I am of the show. I love British TV. So I said yes. And 200 years after Napoleon’s final defeat, Prince Charles commemorates the Battle of Waterloo. Later, on BBC London... And leading Conservatives launch their new campaign against expansion at Heathrow Airport. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Wages have risen by their fastest rate for six years. In the three months to April, pay went up by 2.7% compared with the previous year. And with inflation low, that should mean many people feeling better off. Today’s figures also showed the number of people out of work has fallen again. The jobless total now stands at 1.8 million. The Government says the figures show its economic plan is working, but Labour says too many young people are still out of work. Here is one Here is OFIE I’â8SOI’I Here is one reason for the biggest jump in earnings since 2009. It is getting harder to find the staff, especially those with skills like driving a heavy goods vehicle. Firms can’t meet demand from customers unless they’ve got people to do the job, so they have to pay more to attract them. That rise in average earnings of 2.7% hides big differences between the public and the private sector. In the public sector, pay went up by 1% to an average of ÂlI97 per week. In the private sector, it rose by 3.2% to an average of ÂlI90 per week. Private sector firms like hauliers only paid modest rises until recently because they could always find cheaper labour from Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Now even the supply of migrant workers who can drive a lorry is slowing down, driving pay up. As an industry we are seeing the average salaries increase by eight to 10%. That is not the root cause of the problem. The root cause of the problem is driver training and that cost of driver training and the fact that it costs between £3000 and £5,000 to get a young person trained and into the industry. Do the drivers feel better off? It has picked up, hasn’t it? Nico Green I earn minimum wage and I have to work lots of hours to earn a decent living. Bills are a bit more expensive and we have to work long hours. They can only offer pay rises if each worker becomes more productive and offers more money for them will stop if wages start writing much larger than productivity, that is not sustainable. Unless we see real increases in productivity, which we have not seen since the great recession, then those real wage increases are not going to be sustainable. You are not bringing in more for your firm if you are sat in one of these. Across the economy investment, public and private, is needed to ensure real pay rises can be sustained. Well, while wages overall have gone up, some unlucky customers of the Royal Bank of Scotland may not have received their money this week at all. A computer glitch at RBS means around 600,000 credit and direct debit payments have failed to go through and may not appear in people’s accounts until the weekend. Customers at NatWest, RBS, Ulster Bank and Coutts, which are all part of the same banking group, have been affected. Let’s speak to our Personal Finance correspondent, Simon Gompertz. Simon, first of all, what has happened? Early this morning a message appeared on the Internet, on Twitter, with RBS saying that some of its payments had gone missing and then later it emerged it was 600,000 payments. During the morning, people had been explaining how their wages, benefits such as child benefits and tax credits had not turned up, and that left them with just pennies in their account to be able to pay bills. They said phone a particular number to get a credit to cover it and some people were left hanging on the phone for an hour or so with the customer picking up the bill. RBS says no one will be left out of pocket as a result of this glitch. But it may not be sorted out for days? They say the problem itself has been sorted out so no one will be affected any more. But they say the payments that have gone astray may not be back in the right accounts until Saturday. This is the bank that two summers ago had a meltdown lasting weeks in which people were struggling to get money into their account. It is a further embarrassment and there will be more questions about the reliability of their systems. The mother of two teenage sisters who died in the Hillsborough disaster has been giving evidence at the inquests into their deaths. jenni Hicks lost her two daughters, Sarah and Victoria, in the 1989 tragedy. Our correspondent judith Moritz is in Warrington. judith, what did she have to say? It was a very moving day in court. It is more than 26 years since Hillsborough. Trevor Hicks has told me that he and his former wife are still trying to come to terms with it and you could see that in court this morning, jenni Hicks in tears. One witness, a former PC who tried to help their daughter Sarah, spoke to them both and said he had wanted them to know after all this time that Sarah had not been alone, in her last moment she was with someone who had cared and tried to help. They both said they were very touched to hear that. Lawyers representing Trevor and jenni Hicks have told them they want the witnesses to know how grateful they are. jenni Hicks herself came to the witness box to talk about her experience at Hillsborough and how she had waited, it was several hours before she was able to trace where they were that afternoon. She was eventually ta ken to they were that afternoon. She was eventually taken to see her daughters. 53 instances of possible money laundering are being investigated as part of the inquiry into claims of corruption at world football’s governing body, FIFA. The Swiss Attorney General, Michael Lauber, called the investigation ""huge and complex"", and told a news conference that he hadn’t ruled out speaking to the FIFA president, Sepp Blatter. Our Sports Correspondent, Richard Conway, was at that news conference. It is here at Switzerland’s parliament that the country’s Attorney General has been giving more detail about their inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Michael Lauber says this is a huge and a complex case and the scale of it is summed up by the fact that he says he has seized nine terrabytes of data so far. That is a huge amount of data, files and documents, that they will now have to go through in some detail. He also talked about how the country’s banks have flagged up 53 specific instances where they think potential money-laundering has taken place in relation to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process. That too will be a concern to those within world football and those who want to get to the bottom of that inquiry. Intriguingly, though, he would not be drawn on matters about the South African $10 million bribe that the US allege was paid in connection to them gaining the 2010 World Cup. He said he didn’t want to talk about the focus of his inquiry too much, he did not want to give away too much information at this stage. He also said that at some point jerome Valcke, Fifa’s general secretary, and its president, Sepp Blatter, could be questioned in relation to his inquiries. It seems that these matters for Fifa, spread across multiple jurisdictions, multiple countries, are going to go on for some time yet. David Cameron says he is fast losing patience with the delayed publication of the inquiry into the Iraq war. The chairman, Sirjohn Chilcot, has written to the prime minister saying that he can’t set a timetable for the release of the report, because he’s still waiting for a number of witnesses to respond to criticisms contained in it. Let’s speak to our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith. This is a delay that goes on and on? The fact that the Prime Minister has gone public with his frustrations underlines the anger here at how long Sirjohn is taking. His inquiry has gone now for six years, that is almost longer than British troops were involved in combat operations in Iraq. But the indications are that this report is not going to be published any time soon. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Sir john says he is still waiting to hear from john says he is still waiting to hearfrom some of john says he is still waiting to hear from some of those criticised in the report because they have a right to reply and he cannot produce a report since he gets those replies. Some of those who have written back to him have opened up new lines of inquiry which he has to evaluate. Others have new evidence he will have to secure the release of and then evaluate. In other words he cannot give a deadline for publishing this report, which has prompted calls for Sirjohn to be sacked, for him to be forced to published an interim report, for a deadline to be set. Sir Dominic Grieve, the former Attorney General, said that Sirjohn should ignore those who have not replied and public anyway. At the moment Downing Street is holding back, saying it is an independent inquiry, but the pressure is really mounting now not just on Sirjohn Butt on Downing Street to intervene. Chris Evans has been talking about his new role as the main presenter of Top Gear. The Radio 2 Breakfast Show host told listeners this morning that there was ""lot of work to do and serious focusing to be done."" His appointment follows the departure ofjeremy Clarkson in March after a fracas with one of the show’s producers. Our Arts Correspondent, Lizo Mzimba, reports. Top Gear’s past and Top Gear’s future. The news that Chris Evans was taking over as presenter of the show ended weeks of speculation. He was uncharacteristically tight-lipped as he arrived for his Radio 2 show this morning. But on air he explained his decision. What I do for a air he explained his decision. What Ido for a living is radio, television and a bit of writing. It’s the biggest television show in the world, my favourite television show of all time. You know how much of a fan I am of the show. I’ve loved producing TV and you know the kind of TV I love to produce. And so I said yes. Evans had long been tipped to replace jeremy Clarkson, sacked for punching a producer, despite consistently ruling himself out of the running, even as recently as last week. You’re not going to get my old job, just so you know. Don’t want it, I’ve ruled myself out. You haven’t been asked. Have you been asked? He says that was because he didn’t want to trigger speculation and that everything changed when it became clear that Clarkson’s co-presenters, Richard Hammond and james May, were not returning. It means there will be an all-new line-up for the show, all- new line-up for the show, although all-new line-up for the show, although the rest of the team is yet to be announced. Top Gear is of course one of the BBC’s most important programmes, bringing in huge numbers of viewers and millions of pounds. The loss of the team that has made the show such a success is, at the very least, a challenge. But the BBC is hoping that with Chris Evans in the driving seat, it will still prove to be a ratings hit in the UK and around the world. Our top story this lunchtime: Wages have risen at their fastest rate since the economic crisis. Pay went up by 2.7% and unemployment fell too. A new memorial at Westminster Abbey. We’ll be telling you who’s the latest to make it to the nation’s Poet’s Corner. Later, on BBC London: Are you one of the rail commuters failing to claim from a £56 million pot set aside for delays? And, a bird’s-eye view of Hyde Park - what’s in store for music fans here in the capital? 200 years ago, tens of thousands of troops were preparing to do battle outside the small Belgian town of Waterloo. In 12 hours of bloody fighting, allied forces under the Duke of Wellington defeated the army of Napoleon in a battle that would change the course of Europe’s history. Today, Prince Charles unveiled a memorial to those allied soldiers who died on the fields of Waterloo and our correspondent, Robert Hall, is there. Thanks to a seven-year ""Restoration"" Project, Hougoumont Farm looks as much as it did in 1815, when British soldiers held its gates for nine hours against a much-larger French force. The event that’s being held here is one of many stretching over several days which are drawing tens of thousands to the old battlefield to see history unfolding once more. Sights and sounds of a summer’s day which would change the face of Europe. Around the battlefield, two more armies are assembling here to re-create the hours which were to be Napoleon’s last stand. You can hear the horses whinnying and the bugles and it is really a great feeling of being back in those days. At Hougoumont Farm, defended by the British throughout the battle, a seven-year project has been completed, buildings restored and the first memorial to the British Army erected close to the gates which they famously held against repeated French attacks. It’s the best commission I have ever had. And it’s the most important for me. That is, to me, the best thing I have ever done in my life, I think. Away from Hougoumont, the best view of the battlefield is up the 200 steps of the Lion’s Mound, constructed in memory of the Dutch Prince of Orange, who fought at Waterloo. The monument erected to honour one man overlooks rolling farmland where between 30,000 and 60,000 men were killed or injured. Some historians estimate that 90 men were falling here every minute. It probably was one of the bloodiest12 hours ever. Proportionately, more people were killed in that single day, killed and wounded, than, I believe, at even any of those dreadful First World War battles. This giant painting captures the last great French cavalry charge. One descendant of their emperor argues that, for his country, and for Europe, this anniversary is a time to look forward rather than re-create the past. For most French people, Waterloo is a big defeat and we say, in every day words, that Waterloo is just something you have lost and you can’t get back. In the past hour, the Prince of Wales has been given his glimpse of the past on a brief tour of the battlefield. One visitor among the tens of thousands who will watch an unfolding story and wonder at its cost. The monument to be unveiled here represents all British soldiers who fought and died at Waterloo. This event will be followed by that re-creation of the battle itself, 5,000 soldiers, it promises to be a colourful spectacle. The relatives of the Irish students who died in a balcony collapse in California are on their way to the scene of the tragedy. It’s thought they might be given the first indications of the cause of the accident. Six students died and seven others are still being treated in hospital for their injuries, after they fell to the ground during a birthday party. Here’s our Ireland Correspondent, Chris Buckler. In the streets that were to be their home for the summer, lie tributes to Irish students killed in California. High above the flowers is the apartment where they were all attending a 21st birthday party and the little that remains of the balcony, which chanced throwing -- which collapsed throwing six people to their deaths. EimearWalsh, Lorcan Miller and Olivia Burke, Niccolai Schuster and Eoghan Culligan were 21. Also killed was 22-year-old Ashley Donohoe, who was Olivia’s cousin. The Irish have a tradition of travel and long links with America, like thousands of others the students were taking advantage of summer work visas, making this a grief that is shared between nations. Thousands of miles away, across the Atlantic, a vigil is being held here at a church in South Dublin. Prayers are being said for the students who have been seriously injured and messages of support offered for the families of those killed. I knew Eimear, he was lively, friendly, outgoing, bubbly, a sparkling sort of person. The parents are devastated. There is nothing you can say. Other than that we are here for them. Some of the students went here to University CoUege students went here to University College Dublin and today their friends have talked of their heartbreak. Some of the other young people who were injured remain in hospital and they are seriously ill. Some are said to have life-changing injuries. At buildings throughout Ireland, the Tricolor is flying at half- mast, Ireland, the Tricolor is flying at half-mast, a day of mourning in this nation, while the families of those killed and injured fly to another country where the investigation is still trying to discover what happened in Berkeley. Chris Buckler, BBC News. Police have told the BBC that contact has been made with one of the three sisters who it is thought may have followed their brother to Syria. Let’s speak to our correspondent, who is in Bradford for us. What more can you tell us? Yes, this looks like it is the worst possible news that the family could have expected. Yesterday, we had this emotional appeal by two of the husbands of the missing Bradford women, the three sisters. And the nine children. They were suspected of going to Syria. The North East Counter Terrorism Unit have said, ""We have received information that contact has been made with the family in the UK, which suggests one of the missing adults may be in Syria. Contact has been made by one of the missing women. There is an indication that they may have already crossed the border into Syria but this is uncorroborated."" So, this looks like it’s the news that the family hadn’t wished to hear and it is quite a concerning moment. We are not sure when this contact happened. We understood earlier this morning that there had been no contact from any of the three sisters following last night’s appeal, so it looks like this has happened very rapidly. Police are stressing they are very concerned about the safety of all the three Dawood sisters and the nine children. Thank you. The UK’s leading child protection charity, the NSPCC, says the number of offences against children in England and Wales has risen by a third. It says police recorded 31,000 cases in the year up to April last year. That’s an increase of 8,500 on the previous year. Most of the victims were aged between 12 and 17. Let’s speak to our Home Affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw. These figures look alarming, how do we interpret them? These figures are a tiny fraction of the overall number of offences that are committed against children because these are only the offences that are reported to police and recorded by police. Why are they going up? There’s three reasons. The first thing is, more people are coming forward, more people are emboldened to report what’s happened to them to the police. That’s a knock-on from the Savile scandal. Operation Yewtree. That is regarded as positive news. Police are taking these cases much more seriously. It is a national priority to tackle child sexual abuse, the way police record these offences has improved over the past couple of years. The third reason - over the past couple of years. The third reason - and this is the unknown quantity - third reason - and this is the unknown quantity - is the use of the Internet, the growing use of the Internet to groom children, to look at images, indecent images online and to live stream images of abuse. These are offences that couldn’t have been committed a few years ago. Chief Constable Simon Bailey says because of the Internet, there is a greater prevalence of child sexual abuse in England and Wales. And that raises concerns about the support available for victims and what we do to prevent these crimes from occurring in the first place. Thank you. Last year, 70 kidney patients of Asian origin died while waiting for an organ transplant. Part of the reason is many Muslims think their faith prohibits them from donating organs. But now a number of leading clerics have joined a campaign to reassure Muslims that Islam does allow organ donations to save lives and more people need to come forward to sign up as donors. Here’s our Religious Affairs correspondent, Caroline Wyatt. At her home in Essex, Saddia Karim is on kidney dialysis as she waits for a new kidney from a donor. You don’t have a normal life. Sorry. Saddia may be waiting some time. Often the best tissue match is from someone from a similar ethnic group, but many Muslims worry about donating organs, fearing their religion forbids it. Now, though, some Imams have started to make clear in their sermons that Islam does allow it. It will make a massive difference. They will be able to say yes, you can, it’s not wrong, you’re not going to be doing anything wrong, or you’re not going to be punished or whatever people believe. So, I think I’m really pleased that this is happening because it will make a massive difference in the Muslim community. Other patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham are in a similar position. Kidney specialist Adnan Sharif says waiting times for a good match for Muslim and black and minority ethnic recipients are longer than for white patients. Nearly a third of the waiting list now is made up of people from the black and Asian minority community. Less than 5% of deceased donors come from that community. The Muslim chaplain at the hospital, Rehannah Sadiq, is there to help families at what can be a very difficult time. And reassure them that Islam does not forbid donating or receiving BFI OFQBFI. If my intention is, that I now choose to be a donor and to leave a gift in order to save someone’s life - and that is my true intention - I have a belief that God will reward me for that in the next life. Dr Yassa Mustafa visits mosques to talk to worshippers and Imams about organ donation. The watershed moment for the British Muslim community will happen not when the Muslim religious leaders are actually issuing or providing bits of evidence or guidance to support organ donation, but rather the pivotal moment will happen when they are displaying their own organ donor cards for all to see. Until then, some patients will die waiting for a transplant. And doctors here hope that the current push will help EFICOUFBQE ITIOFE doI’IOI’S to sign up. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News. The poet Philip Larkin is to have a permanent memorial at Poet’s Corner in Westminster Abbey. He’s one of Britain’s most popular poets of the 20th century, although some critics accused him of being a bigot and a misogynist. The stone will be unveiled on December 2nd next year - the 31st anniversary of his death. Here’s our Arts Correspondent, Colin Paterson. Once I’m sure there’s nothing going on, I step inside letting the door thud shut. In his poem Church-going, Philip Larkin wrote about a time in the future when churches would have no use. Now he is to be honoured in one. The man often described as the greatest Poet Laureate Britain never had will be commemorated with a stone in Poet’s Corner in Westminster Abbey, the decision made solely by this man, the Dean of Westminster, who was not put off by Larkin’s views on Christianity. Philip Larkin is one of the great poets of the 20th Century in English and it’s been pressed on me by a number of his friends that it is the right time to memorialise him. Today’s announcement was made here in Philip Larkin’s home town of Hull in the actual office where he worked at the University Library for 30 years. This is his desk. That is his typewriter. These are his glasses. And it is one of his old colleagues who has led the campaign for this recognition. The reason he should be in Poet’s Corner is simply that he’s the most admired and respected poet of the 20th Century and popular, too. He turned down the chance to be Poet Laureate, are you sure he’d actually want to be commemorated in Westminster Abbey? actually want to be commemorated in WestminsterAbbey? He Westminster Abbey? He could see himself coming as an important man in the literary field and, therefore, although he was reticent about things, he would, I’m sure, have been delighted to know he was going to be in Poet’s Corner. Whether he would have liked it or not, 30 years after his death, Philip Larkin, a man who used to be embarrassed when people called him a poet, is to be honoured alongside some of the nation’s greatest. Let’s look at the weather now. If you remember yesterday, I was talking about Tropical Storm Bill. This is the effect which Bill has had, widespread flooding, we have had a lot of rain across this part of the world, so any extra rainfall was bound to cause this sort of extensive flooding and it is not over yet. extensive flooding and it is not overyet. Bill continues extensive flooding and it is not over yet. Bill continues to spiral its way inland. It is not the strength of the wind, it is these pulses of intense rainfall and there is a potential for tornadoes. The radar imagery across the UK is fairly modest, in comparison. On either side of that band of rain, a lot of dry weather. Infact, things improving nicely across northern parts of the country. Some showers across the north-west of Scotland. Elsewhere, things perking UP Scotland. Elsewhere, things perking up quite nicely. There is that weather front, up quite nicely. There is that weatherfront, bringing weather front, bringing some sporadic outbreaks of rain. It is not far away from Trent Bridge, so the start of the one-dayer could be interrupted. The heat is building across the South East. It is muggy. It is humid. Cloud, some sunshine, 24 Celsius. It feels quite oppressive. Tomorrow, same temperature, but a different feel. Much clearer air, same temperature, but a different feel. Much clearerair, blue feel. Much clearer air, blue skies and lower humidity. The sunshine will be strong. We are approaching the summer solstice, so if you are out in the sun, put on some sunscreen. SUFISCFEEFI. A sunscreen. A lot of sunshine on Thursday. Here, the best of the temperatures. Yes, once more, up into the low or mid 20s. Further north, more cloud, more breeze, it will feel cooler. Yes, the odd shower across the north of Scotland. Now, looking further ahead towards the weekend. Not straightforward. A ridge of high pressure, yes, but various weather systems are lined up out in the Atlantic. None of them are active, but they will complicate the weather over the next few days. On Friday, a lot of dry weather. Some sunshine, probably the best of that across the South West. Through this weekend, there will be some sharp showers around, but a lot of dry weather, too, and in any sunshine, it should feel pleasantly warm. Nowa reminder of our top story this lunchtime: Wages have risen at their fastest rate since the economic crisis. Pay went up by 2.7% and unemployment fell, too. And in the last few minutes, police have told the BBC that contact has been made with one of the three sisters who is thought to have followed their brother to Syria. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC London news. A top scientist has warned that Stephen Lawrence’s killers might have escaped justice if their cold case had been examined today, due to what he calls a crisis in criminal forensics. Gary Dobson was jailed after experts found a drop of Mr Lawrence’s blood on fibres in his coat. But a BBC London investigation has been told the number of forensic fibre experts has plummeted, which means some criminals may be slipping through the net. Alex Bushill reports. They are amongst our most highly skilled crime-fighters, on the very cutting edge of technology, who time and again provide the breakthrough, the evidence to jail our most dangerous criminals.

And a pregnant woman loses her baby after being kicked in a targeted attack in a street in Peckham. Good evening. It’s now known that three mothers from Bradford and their nine children who are thought to be in Syria had made a previous attempt to travel to the Middle East. The BBC has seen documents which show that they’d tried and failed to leave the UK back in March when they were held up by security checks. They were then able to book new flights last month. Police have said that one of the mothers has made contact, the suggestion is that the entire group is in Syria, as our correspondent Ed Thomas reports. Afamily A family missing from home, 3 sisters and nine children. Police say there has been contact an old 12 may in Syria. But for the 1st time, the BBC can reveal documents that they tried to travel months ago, and security checks meant they missed their flights. security checks meant they missed theirflights. It their flights. It left neighbours asking why they were allowed to leave the country at the 2nd attempt. The police need to do a betterjob. Are you angry? Of course I am. Why were they not questioning the 2nd time around as to why this family is travelling again? Tonight, the BBC uncovered these travel papers showing the 3 sisters and their nine children booked on a flight from Manchester to jeddah on March 19th. All 12 members of the family were stopped by the police and subsequently missed the flight. The trip was rebooked. On May 28th, they finally flew to jeddah on a Saudi Arabian airlines flight. A few days after arriving, the family changed their plans, moving hotels in Mecca. They were due to fly home onjune 11th but never boarded the flight. These documents shown to the BBC raised important questions. What convinced anti-terror police that this family was safe to leave the UK and what checks did the authorities do here after they had left the country? We tracked down the taxi firm that took them to the airport. They told us what happened. He was crying and in tears. He said one of our lads has gone to Syria. For that reason they are sending the family back. That lad is this man on the left. He is believed to be fighting in Syria. Still he’s three sisters and their nine children were allowed to leave the UK. We have seen other situations where people have absconded, people have been on watchlists and managed to sneak out. People have used fake passports. The difficulty is that you are dealing with people who are really quite determined and want to get to the their goal, which is to reach Syria and Iraq. If you have people who are determined to do that, they will find ways to do that. The BBCupstance one of the three missing sisters who contacted her family to say they were in Syria. Her estranged husband in Pakistan has spoken of his frustration. You tell me your wife and children go to Saudi Arabia and they disappear. Then I’m shocked. Where’s she got without my permission. The north-east counter terrorism unit confirmed the family were #1207d and questioned but cleared to travel. The fathers of the nine missing children face a desperate wait. Ed Thomas, BBC News Bradford. If the three sisters from Bradford and their nine children have crossed into that part of Syria where IS extremists are in control the chances of leaving again are said to be very slim. The border region between Turkey and Syria is increasingly dangerous and few people have been known to return. Our World Affairs Correspondent Paul Wood reports now from the border town of Killis. Turkey’s border with Syria looks a forbidding place, but there’s a steady flow of people crossing, many, perhaps most, without papers. Any alert for the Bradford families wouldn’t have been particularly effective. The smugglers tell us they take people through the wire for 20 Turkish lira each, less than £5. ""It’s not difficult"", he says, ""sometimes the price goes up a bit when there are more border guards, but it’s fine, the Turks take a cut."" On the other side, war. Refugees flee territory that IS lost on Monday. Islamic State’s taking bad losses in northern Syria. Some jihadis are disenchanted and want to leave too. Abu Ibrahim runs a secret network that helps them. Some 400 have been killed trying to escape, he tells me. Hundreds of women, half Westerners, are under house arrest. ""When they arrived they were true believers he says, ""but they were shocked by the reality of life in the caliphate. They know they must leave or die. "" For trapped families this is the future. IS indoctrinates the next generation of suicide bombers! ""Infidels"", he warns, ""we love death as much as you love life."" Of course, we don’t know yet if the Bradford families are now with IS. If you can’t go into Syria officially, sneaking inside isn’t that difficult. A smuggler is paid, a Turkish border guard is bribed, some wire is lifted and it’s a short walk into Syrian territory and then on into the so-called caliphate. But, once inside the land controlled by the Islamic State, it is much more difficult, much more dangerous to leave. The Bradford families might find they’ve bought a one-way ticket. Paul Wood, BBC News, the Turkish border with Syria. With me is our security correspondent. I suppose one of the main questions is, how they were able to book new flights, if they’d come to the attention of the authorities? I think that is right. This revelation does raise real questions. Firstly, what were those initial suspicions and how strong were they which led to those security checks at the first attempt to go out? No doubt due to the brother out there in Syria. Crucially, why were they able to travel out a few months later? Now, it may well have been that in between the sisters had contact with the police and persuaded them that they really were just going out on a religious pilgrimage. From the police point of view, it gets difficult to stop people again and again from travelling. Their powers are relatively limited especially if there is no evidence of terrorism or anyone committing an offence. The police may have been worried about seen to harassing people and stop them going on a religious pilgrimage. The question and that it went wrong, they weren’t going on a pilgrimage does raise real questions. The issue of how good the co-ordination has been with Turkey. With the bettal green schoolgirls there were issues about how much they were told and when. Here, when were the Turks told and how much co-operation was there. The Turkish embassy said there was good co-operation but didn’t have any more details about that. Thank you very much. In Greece, the central bank has warned that the country could be forced to leave the Eurozone if agreement on debt repayments isn’t reached very soon. Greece and its global creditors are blaming each other for the lack of agreement. The prime minister Alexis Tsipras says there’s no room for more cuts. Europe’s finance ministers are meeting again tomorrow, as our correspondent james Reynolds reports from Athens. This is what one half of Europe’s high stakes stairing contest looks like -- high stakes stairing contest looks like -- staring. Demonstrators came to central Athens to tell their government not to blink or giveway. Can you sense the defiance here. The protesters support a government which isn’t backing down. Greece is now playing a came of chicken with its creditors. Games are as old as the country itself. This afternoon, I watched Greeks make their own moves. Their country needs more than a good roll. Do they feel that politicians here and in Europe are gambling with their lives? The politicians... Greek, European politicians. .. Greek, European politicians? politicians... Greek, European politicians? Maybe all of them together. Is this stock broker has to gamble as he watches the Greek standoff with Europe. They call it a game, is that what it feels like in terms of two sides looking at each other? It does, it does a lot. Who wins? Most times the stronger. Who is the stronger? Ah, the European Union. IMF and the European Central Bank. This man has spent a lifetime working out the perfect move. It’s not a game that somebody will win. If we lose, everybody will lose. Maybe some others lose more than us. The game, if that’s the right word for the fate of a country, may be decided soon. The deadline for an agreement is the end ofjune. Tonight the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has spoken to the European Commission president, jean-Claude juncker, that is their first contact in days. From what we know they have yet to set a date for the start of formal talks. Finance ministers will be meeting in Luxembourg tomorrow and EU heads of government are ready to get involved. Huw. james Reynolds there for us in Athens. Average earnings are increasing at the fastest rate since the summer of 2011. Wages rose by 2.7% in the year to April, while unemployment has fallen again to 1.81 million. Our economics editor Robert Peston has been looking at the figures. Britain can’t get enough of these, apprentice bricklayers, learning the trade in Derby as the pay of brickies goes up and up. We are playing more to attract and keep bricklayers. It’s how it is at the moment, supply and demand. We will have to pay more to keep us building houses. It’s boom time out there for us at the moment we need to keep building. How balanced is a British labour market where unmroement has fallen again and almost back to pre-crash levels and where pay excludeing bonuses is rising at rates we haven’t seen for more than five years? You have to have sustainable productivity increases. If wages start rising faster than productivity that is not sustainable, inflation starts going UP sustainable, inflation starts going up and the Bank of England has to raise interest rates. Unless we see real increases of productivity, which we haven’t seen, since the great recession, then those real wage increases will not be sustainable. Impressive output per worker here in northern France. Well, actually, yes. We like to think of France as something of an economic (inaudible) an economy struggling to grow, unemployment read at 10.5%, twice what it is in Britain. There are so many people of working age out here drinking beer and coffee perhaps, it’s a tough life. Forthose in and coffee perhaps, it’s a tough life. For those in work, productivity output is much higher than in Britain. For those lucky enough to have a job, living standards are also higher. Here’s what is striking about France’s higher productivity, according to the owner and boss of an engineering company. You have an operation in Britain, an operation here, in Germany? Belgium. She has been forced to be more efficient than UK businesses because her workers are so expensive. Why do you think that productivity in France is so much better than in Britain? The cost of wages is much higher in France. There is a difference maybe between 20%-30%. I think there is a stronger incentive because of that to invest in order to increase the productivity. Not easy to get the balance between high-octane output in France and a free wheeling labour market as in Britain. It’s what the Chancellor says he wants to achieve in the next Budget. Many hope he won’t wobble. As many as 20 military personnel have been injured in a crash between three troop carriers on Salisbury Plain earlier this evening. Police say at least four people have been left with life-changing injuries. Our correspondent Duncan Kennedy is there. This news is breaking in the past hour, although as you said, the police are saying this happened at about 6:30 PM, involving 3 military personnel carriers in the middle of Salisbury Plain. They were said to be involved in military exercises at the time, although some reports suggest a lorry was involved as well. A lot of Salisbury Plain criss-crosses the countryside and they use civilian roads for those exercises from time to time. Reports that 20 people have been injured in this incident. According to the Southwest Ambulance Service, for all five have life-threatening injuries, life changing injuries I should say. -- four orfive. life changing injuries I should say. -- four or five. Two people with life-threatening injuries have been flown to Southampton hospital, I by the Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance Service, I by the Wiltshire Air Ambulance Service. They say that patients had been taken by road to Salisbury Hospital and others, walking wounded. A major incident taking place here on Salisbury Plain this evening. As a result of this exercise. A lot of military personnel in this area today, a big military pageant to welcome soldiers back to Salisbury Plain from places like Afghanistan and Germany, or it’s not clear who was involved in this incident this evening. Duncan, thank you. The mother of two teenage sisters who died in the Hillsborough football disaster in 1989 has been giving evidence at the inquests into their deaths. jenni Hicks described the moment she found the bodies of both of her children, 15-year-old Victoria and 19-year-old Sarah, in a temporary mortuary at the football stadium. A preliminary investigation suggests the balcony collapse that killed six college students in California was caused by rotten wooden beams. The crowded fifth-floor balcony broke off an apartment building during a 21st birthday party. Five of the dead were from Ireland. It’s thought the wooden beams were not sealed properly when the building was constructed. The London Mayor and MP Borisjohnson has been filmed swearing at a taxi driver. The altercation between the two men is thought to have happened about a week ago. The video was obtained by the Sun newspaper. A source close to the Mayor dismissed it as a fuss about nothing, and said the driver regularly heckled Mrjohnson at meetings. Many thousands of RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers have been left without money to pay bills because of delays in getting funds into their accounts. Some 600,000 transactions have been affected including salaries and benefits. RBS has apologised and says it’s fixed the problem, as our correspondent Simon Gompertz reports. It’s the Twitter message any bank user would dread. ""Some of our customer payments are missing"" - posted by RBS in the early hours. Here’s one of the many thousands affected. Technology salesman Byron Riley, married with a two-year-old, found that hundreds of pounds he was relying on never reached his account. You would hope that you’d be able to feed your family, seven days a week. At this moment in time, I can’t even afford a can of Coke. That’s upsetting. Roll back three years and RBS, along with its offshoots NatWest and Ulster Bank, was down for weeks. Now, it’s having to apologise again. This is just unacceptable. We know that what’s happened is an isolated incident which relates to delay in payments that were due to come in today. Customers have been told that it could take until Saturday to sort out the mess. Some say they’ve been completely stuck without money for food or for gas and electricity. Others that they were kept waiting on the phone for more than an hour at their own expense. What we know is that 600,000 payments have been held up. Among them, tax credits, child benefits and wages. For some reason, at one stage of the process, information on the payments wasn’t entered. The sort of computer glitch that experts are warning bank customers will have to be prepared for. The problem is essentially the infrastructure that we now have behind these systems is really very old. A lot of it’s from the ‘70s, ‘80s. That’s pretty old tech. RBS has promised that no-one will be left out of pocket. But to customers, it’s looking like an accident-prone bank. Faced with rising numbers of migrants entering the country, the French government has announced plans to provide accommodation for more than 10,000 migrants to ease the pressure. Last year, more than 64,000 migrants applied for asylum in France while around 20,000 people were granted legal refugee status. In recent days, police have broken up unlawful encampments in Paris and they’ve sent back hundreds of migrants who tried to cross from Italy, as our special correspondent Fergal Keane reports. A few minutes away from the tourist heart of Paris, just a short walk links the world we know to a world of desperation in this Europe’s summer of the migrant. This camp is near the Eurostar train and about 120 people are camped here. Among them, Hermon - he said he was 15, and he’d travelled for two years from Eritrea to reach here. He’s alone. Hermon is among an estimated 5,000 unaccompanied child migrants to reach Europe since the start of the year. Let me ask him, why did he leave at the age of 13? ""I left"", he said, ""because all of my friends had left."" Where are your parents? Where is your family? Many have no identity papers and to get state help must undergo bone X-rays to try and prove they are children. But with the migrant influx across the Mediterranean, Paris is wary. The gates of this park were locked against the newcomers. But still a few Eritreans camp out. How many months pregnant are you? Seven. Do you know where the baby is going to be born? In the park? Yes. What did you think Europe would be like? ""I thought Europe would be the solution"", she told me. But in some Parisian neighbourhoods an older communal tradition has emerged to welcome migrants. Back at the camp, food, clothes and advice are dispensed by local volunteers. 15-year-old Hermon is given a meal. The family from the park have come here too. Their child has a chest infection. It’s a real crisis for children? Yep. It’s a big crisis and for the mother too because they need help and they need to have treatment for the babies and they can’t have it from me. So it’s very... Yeah, I’m feeling guilty, is it? Yeah, feeling guilty. You feel guilty? Yeah, because I can’t help. Compared to Sicily, compared to Calais, the numbers here in Paris are still small, but the French government fears an influx and that’s why you’re not seeing any welcome here for the migrants who’ve arrived and yet, every day, European navies are rescuing more people from the Mediterranean, while European governments have no policy to deal with them. Today’s government announcement is double-edged, shelter for those seeking asylum in France, but little for people trying to reach other countries like Britain or for economic migrants. Dominique Versini is Deputy Mayor of Paris. TRANSLATION: This is a European question. All of Europe must take its share of responsibility. The French government has announced measures for asylum seekers so that Paris does not end up in the same situation as Calais. But it’s hard to see the measures working. Many see no future in France and want to reach countries like Britain or Holland. Hermon says other boys from his village are in the Netherlands. In a complex and escalating crisis, this child has learnt to trust only his own instinct for survival. Football and the Women’s World Cup now. England are on track to qualify for the final stages of the competition. They took an early lead in theirfinal group game competition. They took an early lead in their final group game against Colombia, a penalty from Williams has given them a 2-0 lead with about 20 minutes left. Philip Larkin, acknowledged as one of the greatest English poets of the 20th Century, is to be honoured with a memorial in Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey. His name willjoin those of Britain’s greatest writers, including Chaucer, jane Austen and Wordsworth. Larkin is one of the few to have rejected an invitation to become Poet Laureate, as our arts editor, Will Gompertz, reports. When getting my nose in a book cured most things, short of school, it was worth ruining my eyes to know I could still keep cool. Philip Larkin reciting his poem, A Study of Reading Habits. It is typical of his work, direct, unaffected and witty. His talent has always been evident and now, 30 years after his death, he will take his place in Poets’ Corner, a decision his biographer and fellow poet, Sir Andrew Motion, fully supports. That ability to concentrate things, to distil things in poems into phrases which enter our minds and our bloodstreams and actually into the national bloodstream is very remarkable in him. What would he have made of it? What would he have made of being in Poets’ Corner? He would have loved it. I’m so pleased this has happened, for poetry, but I’m also incredibly pleased that it’s happened for him. I should think his shade is skipping around in heaven. This is Poets’ Corner in Westminster Abbey, which all started in the mid-16th Century with the installation of Chaucer’s tomb. After which it was considered a good idea to use the space to commemorate other great literary giants. There’s a stone here for Robert Browning, Alford, Lord Tennyson, TS Eliot and Ted Hughes. It’s thought when Larkin’s stone is placed here, at the end of next year, he’s likely to be positioned around here. The decision to commemorate Larkin in Poets’ Corner is not without controversy. The plain-speaking poet was also a plain speaking man who held sexist and racist views. He was a man of his time and there are attitudes which perhaps were more widely held in those days, certainly than they would be now and we would condemn them in someone now, but of his time I think it’s possible to overlook them. Perhaps it’s best to take the advice of DH Lawrence, a long-term resident of Poets’ Corner, who said the proper function of the critic is to save the tale from the artist who created it. Before we go. On the eve of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, the Prince of Wales has unveiled a memorial in Belgium to the British soldiers who fought there. The memorial is at Hougoumont Farm, which was defended by the Duke of Wellington’s Allied army against Napoleon’s troops. The farm has undergone a multi-million-pound restoration. That’s all from us.

And more financial help for trainee doctors, who become GPs in parts of England where there are shortages. Later on BBC London. A breakthrough in the murder of a Pakistani politician in London five years ago. Two are arrested in Islamabad. Helping children with autism excel in the digital age. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. A smuggler with links to the extremists of so-called Islamic State has told the BBC that the family of 12 who disappeared from Bradford are now in Syria. The three sisters and their children aged between 3 and 15 disappeared after going on an Islamic pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. It’s thought they crossed border near the Turkish town of Urfa and possibly heading for the Syrian town of Raqqa. The news comes on the day that David Cameron told a security conference that radicalisation had to be tackled at its source and he condemned British Muslims who as he put it ""quietly condone"" the ideology of Islamic State. Our first report is from our correspondent Paul Wood on the Syrian Turkish border. We’re told that the women and their children were split into two groups to cross the border into Syria. The first six went in the early hours of Wednesday. The final group went yesterday. That’s according to a man who is part of the Isis smuggling network. This information fits that the news that one of the sisters, Zohra, sent a message to her family that she was inside Syria. She didn’t say exactly where or with who. If what the smuggler says is true, it clears up the main ambiguity of this story. Whether the sisters were really heading for the so-called Islamic State or some other part of Syria, controlled by some other armed group. The fall of the Isis-held town of Talabiad on Monday cut of a major supply route for the jihadis. According to the smugglers, IS has one route into Syria still working from a village on the border south of Urfa in Turkey. Loyal to the jihadis. The border at that point is poorly guarded and in many places consists only of a fence. The sisters and their children would have entered the so-called Islamic State fairly easily. If there, though, they will not be allowed to leave. That news comes on the day the Prime Minister accused some Muslim communities of quietly approving of the ideology of IS. David Cameron said that ""paved the way"" for young people to join the extremists. He made his comments during a speech in Slovakia, from where our Political Correspondent Ben Wright sent this report. Three sisters who turned their backs on Britain and took their children with them. Now they have been smuggled into Syria to join Islamic State. In Iraq, a 17-year-old boy from Dewsbury became Britain’s youngest suicide bomber. But why do these people turn to extremism? Who is responsible? And what can be done to stop them? In Slovakia this lunchtime, David Cameron told a security conference it was wrong to simply blame the authorities for letting them leave. Muslim communities, he said, had to take more responsibility. There are people who hold some of these views who don’t go as far as advocating violence. But who do buy into some of these prejudices, giving the extreme Islamist narrative weight and telling fellow Muslims, ""You are part of this"". In frank language, the Prime Minister said extremism had to be tackled and stopped at its source. Butjihadism is proving a powerful pull to some in Britain. When it comes tojihadi mania, you have a situation where young men and boys want to be like them and girls want to be with them. That’s what’s happening. If there aren’t role models who are standing up, speaking out, who aren’t meeting their ambitions and aspirations, then young people will seek it elsewhere. Very often, they will look online. This is not happening in the mosques. Some said the government’s anti-extremism Prevent programme needed a major overhaul to help communities stop radicalisation in the first place. Speaking here in the last few minutes, David Cameron gave a blunt assessment of the risk posed by Islamic State. Saying the threat was formidable, grave and growing. But in response to the situation in Syria, Mr Cameron said Britain was prepared to modestly increase the number of refugees from Syria that Britain was now prepared to take in. Our correspondent, judith Moritz, is at a mosque in Bradford. What’s the reaction been from people you’ve been talking to? Well, here at the mosque it is the first Friday prayers of Ramadan, members of the committee coming and going. We have been speaking to them and they are saying a range of things. In response to David Cameron, about more responsibility belonging to the communities, there has been agreement actually. We have spoken to people here who say they have been saying the same thing for a long time and some of the women we have spoken to have said, still further, not only do they think there should be responsibility within the community to do more but particularly a responsibility on the shoulders of the men of the community, who they say should be speaking to women and telling them as a priority that the sort of thing is not acceptable. Here at the mosque and as pros begin, the imam is going to ask the community to PVGY is going to ask the community to pray for the family -- is going to ask the community to pray for the family -- as prayers begin. Also he will be talking to the community about peacefulness and the importance of that with a family situation very much in his mind. And then, lastly, in terms of what happened overnight and the information the BBC has established from the Turkey and Syria border, we have approached the husbands of two of the women and, through their lawyer, they are very shocked to have learned this morning at what the BBC knows. They say they would like to know more particularly from the police. The lawyer is imploring the counterterrorism unit and West Yorkshire Police to find as much information as they can because they are still learning things piecemeal, trying to find out what’s happening, and the sort of information is emerging bit by bit and it’s shocking. It is shocking information and something they are still very much trying to come to terms with. OK, judith. Many thanks. Police are investigating whether a man, whose body was found on the roof of a shop in West London, may have fallen from the undercarriage of a plane coming in to land at Heathrow. Another man is in a critical condition in hospital after also being found in the landing gear of a plane, though it’s not known whether it was the same flight. Sarah Campbell reports. Two men, one alive and one in a critical condition in hospital, the other dead. Did they stowaway on an 8000 mile flight from South Africa? The police were called just after 9am yesterday morning to a business in west London. It lies directly underneath the Heathrow flight path. And a body had been spotted on the roof. It’s awful, absolutely awful. I worry that it may happen in the middle of the street. And there will be lots of people around. It is tragic, what has happened. The airport regulations need to be stepped up. I do not know how the individuals managed to get into a plane or onto the runway. just an hour before that discovery, a stowaway had been found at Heathrow Airport, unconscious but alive in the undercarriage of a flight from johannesburg. The man is believed to be aged 24 and is now in a critical condition in a west London hospital. The police say at the moment they have no evidence the man now in hospital and the man found dead in Richmond travelled together, but say: Surviving a flight would be difficult. But there have been previous examples. In April, 2014, a 16-year-old boy survived a five-hour flight from Sanjose in the US to Hawaii by hiding in the wheel well. But the flight from johannesburg would have been much longer. We are talking about aircraft that has flown for 12 or 11+ hours in duration. We are talking about an aircraft that has flown up to 1+1,000 feet. The maximum ceiling, in other words. We are talking about outside air temperatures that could have descended as low as -60 degrees. There are still many unanswered questions. But it appears that at least one man was willing to risk his life travelling to the UK. In the last few minutes, Mo Farah has given his reaction to the claims he missed two doping tests before the 2012 Olympics. Let’s speak to our Sports Editor, Dan Roan, who’s in Salford. What has he had to say? It’s been a tough couple of weeks for Mo Farah. First of all, the British middle-distance runner and Olympic will champion faced allegations made against his coach, Alberto Salazar and his training partner. In a BBC documentary. Both men strenuously deny those allegations and there is no suggestion that Mo Farah was guilty of any wrongdoing and then yesterday, in a newspaper report, he missed two drug tests in 2010 and 2011 and suggested he may have missed out on the Olympics when he won two golds, Hadi had a third missed test. He now has given a statement in response to those report and said he’s never taken performance enhancing drugs and he never will. performance enhancing drugs and he neverwill. In never will. In the course of his career, he’s taken lots of tests and everyone has been negative. The only two tests I have missed was never any suggestion that these were more than simply mistakes. The last two weeks have been the toughest of my life with rumours and speculation about me. They are completely false and the impact on my family and friends have left me angry, frustrated and upset. In particular, the media pressure on my wife and young family. She is five months pregnant. He went to Portland in Oregon where he trained with Alberto Salazar to speak to him and demand answers and he reassured me the claims are false and he will be providing evidence to make that clear. Untilthen, Iwill providing evidence to make that clear. Until then, I will not comment further on the allegations. He then thanks his fans, family, friends and team-mates for their support they have provided over the last few days and he hopes he will be allowed no to focus on his training and winning medals for my country. His first appearance since the allegations made against them will be onjuly the 17th in Monaco full speed is currently training in France. Thank you very much. Trainee doctors are to get financial incentives to become family doctors in parts of England where there are shortages. The announcement was made today by the Health secretary, jeremy Hunt, who wants 5,000 more doctors to go into general practice. But in return, he wants GPs to provide a seven-day-a-week service. Our Health correspondent Adam Brimelow has the details. Have you Have yOU Ci’IOSâI’I yOUIâ Have you chosen your family doctor? The personal connection between a GP and a patient has been a bedrock of the NHS ever since it was set up but it’s become harder to sustain as pressure on the profession has grown with people living longer, often with complex conditions. Choose your doctor now. The Health Secretary says general practice in England must expand and improve to ease the burden on hospitals. That will mean new ways of working, that use of technology and crucially, seven-day access. A tall order with many GPs already feeling overworked and demoralised but he says, with the right support, thousands more young doctors can be into GPs. What you have in general practice is a special magic, relationship with your patient that could span decades. You don’t have that opportunity as a hospital doctor and it is going to be at the changes we want to see at the NHS. This GP practice in West London recently started offering routine appointments on Saturdays and Sundays. The doctors say patients like coming in at a time which suits them. And it helps avoid frantic scrambles around weekends. This has all gone now, so we don’t get that pressure on a Friday evening or a Monday morning. The whole week runs seamlessly. Practices like this show that providing seven day access can work well for patients and for GPs. But doctors leaders say expanding and improving services in this way will require a lot of extra investment. We cannot stretch an already overstretched service more thinly without undermining the quality of care provided to patients. We can’t provide a five-day service well enough let alone a seven-day service. I like the interaction with patients. There are will be new incentives to get more GPs into areas with the worst shortages but achieving all this will also require a big shift in attitudes, so more trainee doctors choose general practice. Our Health Editor Hugh Pym is with me. A lukewarm response for Hunt’s proposals, yet GPs are crying out for help? Yes, ina Yes, in a way, the government may be relieved it was lukewarm rather than a bucket of cold water. GPs for months have been saying the workload is becoming intolerable because of increasing patient numbers, they are struggling to recruit in parts of the country. They say General practice funding has fallen in successive years and they want immediate action. At leastjeremy Hunt has come out with a series of proposals for addressing these issues. Doctors representatives want to see how that will pan out, they say they are keen to work with the government on these ideas. The financial incentives to recruit new GPs and trainee doctors in different parts of the country given the imbalances in some areas it is hard to recruit and in other areas it is easier to recruit, that is a new policy. People will watch to see how that will play out. One distinctly missing element is where is the new money, the new funding for this? The government says, trust us, we delivered for the NHS before, we will deliver the money required. Mr Hunt is saying he will provide the money for new doctors, you do your bit, to the doctors and deliver this seven-day week access. Thanks. The time isjust after quarter past one. Our top story this lunchtime: A people-smuggler linked to Islamic State tells the BBC the missing family of 12 from Bradford are in Syria. We are in Greece where people are withdrawing their savings as the Greek debt crisis deepens. Rising from the ashes, why the National Trust hopes this stately home in Surrey may yet have a future. And stepping back in time. The BT tower reopens its revolving restaurant to mark its 50th anniversary. With the clock ticking, the leaders of the Eurozone countries have been called to an emergency summit on Monday in what could be their final attempt to prevent Greece sliding into bankruptcy. Finance ministers failed to reach an agreement at their two-day meeting in Luxembourg yesterday. In Greece, people have been withdrawing their money from banks and the authorities say there is no cause for panic. Here’s our Europe Correspondent Chris Morris. In central Athens, the cashpoints do study business. Yesterday alone, Greeks withdrew more than 1 billion euros from their accounts. They prepare for anything but they also hold onto their hopes. We can live even with exit of the Eurozone. The solution is possible. If we don’t find a solution... It is not the end of the world, in any way. I am very optimistic. And I trust our new Prime Minister. I do. This economist has monitored the pace of bank withdrawals. If you are not in a bank run, are you in a bank walk? Yes, something like that. But the walking has been increasing rapidly, those last days. We’re not sure if it is walking or running. We will see. These are the banknotes this country left behind when itjoined the euro. The Greek drachma is now a relic for sale in antique shops. You don’t have to go far to find signs of Greece’s past. You’ve got some of its old coins here and there is also a very famous warning, which was printed about 70 or 80 years ago and posted in shops which shows a very happy man on the left. He sells for cash. And a rather miserable looking man here on the right. He sells on credit. This market runs on cash. This country’s government now runs on fumes. If it cuts spending, it may get more loans, but right now, Greek cuts are made by its butchers, not its politicians. Vigils have been held across the United States for the victims of the shooting at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. Nine people died when a white gunman, Dylann Roof, joined the congregation, then opened fire. He’s due to appear in court later today. Our correspondent, Richard Galpin, has the latest. Handcuffed Ha ndcuffed and wearing Handcuffed and wearing prison clothes, Dylann Roof was arrested by police after being spotted driving to the neighbouring state of North Carolina. Now after returning to Charleston, the US media reports say he has confessed to carrying out the attack. The city has been in mourning since the shooting yesterday. People here profoundly shocked that a gunman could open fire on members of the congregation inside a church. This evil has now come into the house of God. Where people should feel safe, where they come for safety. Where they come for peace. When they come when they are in trouble, they come to the house of God. Outside the historic annual African American church where the attack took place, mourners had been laying flowers in memory of the nine people killed. The eldest was 87. Yesterday, the police put out these pictures from a CCTV camera of Dylann Roof at the church, where he joined a prayer meeting. And this unverified video from social media reportedly shows Dylann Roof sitting right at the back of the meeting shortly before the meeting. A former school friend said Roof had expressed extreme views about the black community. He was a racist. He told me that black people were taking over the country. And that he wanted there to be segregation. Whites with whites and blacks with blacks. The morning in Charleston and many other parts of the country will continue today. Members of the black and white communities coming together in solidarity. After an attack which it seems was designed to inflame racial tensions. Our correspondent, Rajini Vaidyanathan, is in Charleston. A city in tremendous shock? It is reeling with shock from this event? Charleston is nicknamed the holy city because of the large number of churches here and the reliance on faith. It is faith which is giving people strength at this truly difficult time. Last might I attended a vigilfor one difficult time. Last might I attended a vigil for one of the nine victims, a l+5-year-old mother of three. Afterwards I spoke to two of her children, who are both teenagers. They told me they already forgive their mother’s killer. Instead, they say they want to focus on love. At a separate vigil, the governor of this state, Nikki Haley, said she believed Charleston would come out stronger. But other people that you talk to do believe something needs to be done to address the rooted deep tensions here. They say that is the only way that Charleston can truly heal. Many thanks. A woman who claimed jehovah’s Witness elders failed to protect her from sex abuse at the hands of a paedophile has won a six-figure payout. The woman, now in her twenties, alleges she was sexually abused as a child in Loughborough by Peter Stewart, who was a ministerial servant, or overseer, and who used his position to abuse her. It is the first civil case in the UK of historical sexual abuse brought against the Christian-based religious movement. Our legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman reports. Between the ages of four and nine in the late 1980s and early 1990s Amelia, not her real name, was subjected to prolonged and appalling sexual abuse by Peter Stewart, a chartered by the jehovah’s Witnesses in Loughborough as a ministerial servant. Mutch trusted by. At the time it was horrible, confusing and itjust made you feel ridiculous levels of guilt that you were constantly singing. Doing awful things. You will be killed at Armageddon because you were doing these awful thing. No matter how badly you tried to avoid it and stop it, it never happened, you could never get away from it. Because he would always pop up. Shortly after her abuse began, would always pop up. Shortly after herabuse began, Peter her abuse began, Peter Stewart was found to have abused another child in the jehovah’s Witness community. He was removed as a ministerial servant. But because he told elders he had repented, he was allowed to continue to lead many of the activities he performed in that role. He continued to abuse Amelia for another four years. role. He continued to abuse Amelia foranotherfouryears. In for another four years. In 1995, Peter Stewart was convicted of child sexual offences including rape and indecent assault and sentenced to five years in prison. When Peter Stewart was released from prison, he wrote this letter to Amelia’s mother and he spoke directly to Amelia. ""Do not let the actions of a pervert, you know that is howl not let the actions of a pervert, you know that is how I am now know, an you in your future life. I can’t undo what I have done"". -- an you in your future life. I can’t undo what I have done"". -- harm you. The judge ruled that the jehovah’s Witness organisation was liable for the abuse carried out by Peter Stuart and had failed to take sufficient safeguarding measures to protect immediate -- sufficient safeguarding measures to protect immediate -- by Peter Stewart it should be a wake-up call. But they need to intimate better child safeguarding policies. That are in line with modern-day knowledge about child safeguarding and sexual abuse. The Charity commission which regulates charities in England and Wales is currently investigating the jehovah’s Witnesses safeguarding policy. For Amelia, then now needs to be a new approach. They need to admit to themselves that there is a massive problem. These are people who have suffered a horrible, horrible crime and happy had their lives wrecked. They are not out to destroy the organisation. The jehovah’s Witnesses organisation has said it will review today’s judgement. A 2lI-year-old woman has died after being hit by a rock which fell from a cliff at a beach in South Wales. It happened yesterday at Llantwit Major. Our Wales correspondent, Hywel Griffith, is there. These limestone cliffs form a 11+ mile stretch that is well-known and well loved by walkers, surfers and sunbathers. Their appeal is obvious. But so are the dangers as rock ‘s fall down onto the beach. Yesterday those risks became very real. This beauty spot became the scene of a tragic accident. A coastline carved over millions of years. That can crumble in a matter of seconds. Signs warn walkers that rockfalls happen here regularly. The erosion is constant and unpredictable. When the emergency services arrived, there was little they could do to save the 2lI-year-old woman who had fatal head injuries after a rock fell on her. Alice was camping nearby and saw the paramedics at work. You could tell that something really bad had happened especially when the lady was taken from behind the cliffs, just taken into one of the ambulances in hysterical tears. She looked really upset, so I thought something the bad had happened. Whenever they are battered by the Bristol Channel, or soaked by rain, these rocks become unstable. There are warnings, but this morning we saw them being disregarded. It’s difficult. You can have too many signs and people ignore them or they think it won’t happen to me. I’m only here for ten minutes, half an hour. During that time, of course, a rock can come down. You only need a small rock from 1,500 feet. The sudden loss of life has left people in shock. The beach party planned for this evening has been cancelled as a mark of respect. coastline say they inspected annually but we are on expecting them to carry out a new inspection following today’s accident. They want to show caution when they come to enjoy these cliffs. Let’s go back to our main story. A people-smuggler linked to Islamic State has told the BBC the missing family of 12 from Bradford are in Syria. We can speak to Paul Wood who is on the Turkey- Syria border, how did you manage to find this out and tell us more about what you were told. This is a smuggler who has been known to our local staff for some time. He phoned us at one time in the morning and in the normal course, he said you know that half of these people, these 12 missing UK citizens have gone and the other half are going now. He is a smuggler. Inevitably, the conversation smuggler. Inevitably, the conversation came around to money. The information came without any price tag attached to it. It is credible information. Although, not corroborated and from a single source. Nevertheless, he is a member of Isis. He runs part of the smuggling organisation on the border. If he is indeed correct, the three women, the three sisters and nine children are not only beyond the reach of British authorities but beyond the reach of these rather heart-rending appeals we have heard from the families in the UK. Once you go into Isis territory, that is a one-way ticket, they do not allow you to leave. Activists have told us some 1+00 disenchanted jihadi people had been killed trying to leave. 200 women are under house arrest. If they are in Isis territory, they are staying there. Let’s take a look at the weather. ~ I don’t know whether to smile or to frown. Quite a variety on offer across the British Isles. A fair amount of cloud, more than yesterday. It makes a big difference, as was the case yesterday, two temperatures. Lurking in the teens, at best, 21 somewhere in the South West bright quarter. Plenty of cloud streaming in from the Atlantic. Some rain moving around. It will not be cold. The cloud will thicken as the fronts move in. If you are stuck between the warm and cold front in the West, it is murky. It is and pieces of rain. Get behind the weather fronts to see any chance of meaningful sunshine of the day. That perhaps comes as a prize. Let’s put detail on the afternoon. A lot going on. Fetes and weddings. Scotland, bits of rain, nothing to write home about. It is dry. It may not look like it. Northern Ireland, a mixture. The weather fronts move through the north parts of England, it breaks up the cloud of a high ground. A speckling of showers. If it gets warm enough, 21, we may start generating some hefty showers. Initially in the West. But they will not stick there. Through the course of the evening, we may have thunderstorms producing a bit of rain. If they come off. As they work their way towards East Anglia and the south-east. Clear and dry conditions moving in. England and Wales, for the most part on Sunday, breezy in the north and a scattering of showers but much drier. Than Scotland and Northern Ireland, specially the north-east of Scotland. More rain there. This is the spread of temperatures will stop lots going on. Including the somersaults displaced in the day on Sunday. The longest Day -- summer solstice. I hope some of you will enjoy pleasant sunshine for whatever those events may be. Some will not be the first word on your lips on Monday, I’m afraid. Flamingjune maybe a phrase. This is the reason. An awful lot of rain across southern parts and further north with the wind coming in from the North. Cool North Sea. There will be some sunshine but there will be some showers. 20 but a distant memory. Disappointing. Go online. That is all from us, now it is time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Welcome to BBC London News. I’m Alex Bushill. Two men have been arrested in Islamabad in connection with the murder of a Pakistani politician in London. Dr Imran Farooq was stabbed several times and bludgeoned with a brick after he was ambushed by two men outside his home in Edgware in 2010. Shahzebjillanijoins me now from Pakistan. What more do we know? Why is this case so significant? It is a high profile murder and significant because it was seen as a politically motivated killing in London. The murdered man, Dr Imran Farooq, was a prominent leaderfor one of the main parties of Pakistan. He was living in London in Excel for a number of years. On September, 2010, he was heading home when he was approached by two men, who stabbed him to death. Now, at the time of his killing, there were reports he was thinking about ",,

Later on BBC London: jailed - the paedophile who admitted to a series of sexual offences against children including ten acts of rape. After fire destroyed a historic Surrey stately home, experts say the building can be rebuilt. Good evening. One of the women from Bradford who has taken her children to Syria said before she left that she did not want her children growing up in Britain and that England was becoming ""more like America"". That’s what a friend of hers has claimed in an exclusive interview with the BBC. Earlier this week it emerged the woman and two of her sisters are believed to have travelled to join so-called Islamic State taking their nine children with them. Today, David Cameron urged Muslims to do more to fight radicalism within their own community. Our correspondent, Ed Thomas, has this exclusive report. Bradford, the place the Dawoods grew up and the city their nine children called home, before all 12 left for Syria and the brutality of Islamic State. She said, I don’t want my children living in this society. This woman has claimed, for the first time, the intentions of one of the sisters. She’s a friend of Zohra Dawood, the mother of Nurah and Haafiyah. The first to arrive in Syria. She fears for her safety and asked us to protect her identity. She explained why Zohra wanted to leave. She said she wants to live in Saudi Arabia because she didn’t like the UK. She didn’t want her daughters to grow up in England. Did she reject British values? She did, yeah. She said England will be more like America. This is where Zohra lived in Bradford. Here she would teach Arabic classes and she was said to be close to her brother, here on the left. He’s now thought to be fighting in Syria. Who do you think convinced Zohra to make this journey to Turkey and onwards? I think her brother, and she convinced her sisters to do the same to help their brother out. What are your fears now for this family and the children? Why has she taken them into a warzone? They were perfectly happy children. We’re all worried for the children. The youngest of the children thought to be in Syria isjust three. Equally disturbing is what 1lI-year-old Ibrahim is said to have revealed to his friends. He used to say, ""I’m going to Syria to fight."" What was your reaction when you heard that? I was shocked. I said, "" He’s only Iii and he’s saying this."" Did you speak to her and say, ""Zohra, this is wrong?"" No, because by then Zohra completely ignored us. She didn’t talk to anyone. Today, David Cameron described the threat of Islamic State as grave. He challenged Muslims, accusing some of silently condoning the violence and hatred. There are people who hold some of these views, who don’t go as far as advocating violence but do buy into some of these prejudices, giving the extreme Islamist narrative weight and telling fellow Muslims, you are part of this. How was that message received here in Bradford? A city searching for answers. There are certain elements within the Muslim communities who are sympathisers of IS and they are based in the United Kingdom. But at the same time, communities have got their responsibilities, but Government has got their responsibility as well. It is a big community, the Muslim community. There and are a lot of people who don’t condone what they do and are very much against it. The Prime Minister and everybody else in Britain has to recognise that. But here, the concern is the safety of those children. If Zohra is listening to this now, what is your message to her? just bring them children back. Bring them back safely. They are only little children. They’ve got their whole lives to live. The fear is that it may now be too late for these young children. Ed Thomas, BBC News, Bradford. Well, the BBC has been learning more about how the Bradford families crossed Turkey’s border with Syria and our Middle East correspondent, Paul Wood, is there for us now. What have you been able to find out? Well, we have been speaking to an Lofoton Islands smuggler. He told us that -- Lofoton Islands smuggler. He told us that -- to an Isis smuggler. He told us it was split into a group of six. The first six, he says, left on Tuesday night, arriving on Wednesday. The second six arrived on Thursday. And all he said are now in territory controlled by Islamic State. That is one source who wishes, for obvious reasons, to remain anonymous. It is somebody on the inside of the organisation who helps to run the smuggler. If they are indeed in that territory, that is very serious. There are standing orders on Isis check points not to allow foreigners out, not to allow those who have joined allow foreigners out, not to allow those who havejoined Islamic those who have joined Islamic State to leave again. We have been told by activists that as many as 600 have tried to leave and been killed in the attempt or executed. If the Dawood sisters have changed their minds it will be difficult, perhaps impossible, for them to leave. Thank you. The 21 year old suspected of killing nine people in a church in the United States has, according to the police, confessed to the crime saying he wanted to start a race war. Dylann Roof has appeared in court in Charleston, South Carolina, where relatives of some of those killed told him they forgave him, despite theiranguish. Dyla nn Dylann Roof, brought back to South Carolina, handcuffed and legs in shackles on a private plane. Officials say he has confessed to the murders and told them he wanted to ignite a race war. Thank you very much. Please be seated. Today, a bail hearing. Roof appearing by video link from a prison cell. You are charged with nine counts of murder and count of possession of a weapon... Forthe murder and count of possession of a weapon... For the first time Charleston heard the voice of the man accused of killing nine citizens in a bible class. Is your address, 101+2... Is it? Yes. Thank you, Sir. What is your age? 21. You Yes. Thank you, Sir. What is your age? 21.You are 21. Are you employed? No, Sir. You are unemployed at this time? Yes, Sir. Thank you. There was deeply moving testimony from family members who had lost loved ones. You have killed some of the most beautiful people I have ever known. Every fibre of my body hurts. This woman’s daughter spoke of the pain. You took something very precious away from me. I will never be able to hold her again. But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul. Throughout, he stood impassive. Two days ago, Dylann Roof spent the morning playing computer games and drinking vodka with this man before the shootings at the Church. He told me that the black people were taking over the country and that he wanted it to be segregation, white with the white and the black with the black. But far from driving people apart, this is a community which is coming together. This was a vigil for one of those killed at the Church. Her teenage children were among the mourners. They told us their faith had helped them cope. I am a little bitter, but it, I am overwhelmed with love. We already forgive him for what he’s done. And there’s nothing but love from our side of the family. This evening, a sports arena will be filled to remember all nine victims of the Bible study killings. Well s sitting in the court today it is hard to underestimate the spirit shown there. Barack obama has gone on his personal account on Twitter to talk about the generosity of spirit, that in the darkest hour these people have shown how good American families can be. Fiona. The European Central Bank has approved emergency funding to Greek banks for the second time in three days. People have withdrawn more than three billion euros from the banks this week as the deadline draws near for the country to resolve the debt crisis. Here’s our economics editor, Robert Peston. Greece, a country facing default on its massive Government debts. Greek savers increasingly anxious whether their precious euros are safe in their banks. TRANSLATION: I don’t want to return to the drachma. If we are out of Europe, things could get a bit dangerous. I think we find the solution and stay in the euro. We want that and everybody wants that. When the Greek financial crisis began at the end of 2009, people and businesses had 250 billion euros of savings and deposits in Greek banks. Since then, worried savers have withdrawn around 100 billion euros, and three billion euros has been taken out in the past few days. So, to stop the banks collapsing for lack of cash, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Greece have lent around 120 billion euros to the banks to keep them alive. And today, the European Central Bank’s governing council agreed to lend even more, so that Greek banks can repay panicky savers between now and Monday’s big meeting of eurozone leaders. If that emergency summit does not deliver a rescue to the Greek Prime Minister maybe he’ll get help from his new friends here in St Petersburg, who include the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. TRANSLATION: We are in the middle of a big storm, but we are a sea nation that knows how to escape the big sea storms and is not afraid to open up to open seas, to unexplored seas in order to reach new and safe harbours. The UK, not in the euro, is a spectator of this Greek tragedy and our Chancellor, arriving in Luxembourg, just couldn’t avert his gaze. We hope for the best, but we must be prepared for the worst and in the United Kingdom, we’ve taken the measures to increase our economic security, so we can deal with risks like this from abroad and clearly now we must go on and complete that plan. So, farthe UK, what is happening is not terrible, but... So, for the UK, what is happening A weaker euro means a stronger pound and that could hurt our exporters. The banks here have less exposure to Greece and the Bank of England, we are a strong economy already, would haven’t to do too much. An economy, meaning emergency care and workers, including ambulance driver, doing more for less. Salaries are getting lower. And national health and wealth tragedy, ambulances out of commission for want of the money to fix them and if eurozone leaders do not deliver precious billions of new loans to Greece on Monday night, well this car park and much of a proud nation could degenerate into a scrap yard. Robert Peston, BBC News. Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah has insisted he has never taken performance-enhancing drugs and never will. He was responding to reports that he missed two drugs tests before the London 2012 Olympics. He has been under pressure ever since his coach, Alberto Salazar, faced allegations of doping aired in a BBC Panorama. There is no suggestion Mo Farah has done anything wrong. Here’s our sports editor, Dan Roan. Mo Farah came here to his retreat high in the Pyrenees to focus on his training. So much for that. Can we ask you a couple of questions, seriously? Yesterday it was reported the double world and Olympic champion had missed two drug tests in the build-up to London 2012. Today came his response, after what he called the ""toughest two weeks of his life."" In a statement, Farah said: Former British middle distance runner, Becky Lyne knows what it is like to miss two drug tests. She did so in 2006. How does she feel about Farah, a man she used to train with? Sympathy, because I have been there myself and I know that the two missed tests - it really isn’t a reason to be suspicious of people. Although I know that is hard for the general public to appreciate. There’ll be concern that Farah was one more missed test away from a ban which may have ruled him out of the London Olympics and those two gold medals. Mo Farah’s feats here at London 2012 were the pinnacle of a glittering career. He now wants to focus on delivering more medals, but his confirmation of these two missed drugs tests comes after an incredibly challenging fortnight for one of the country’s sporting greats. Earlier this month, doping allegations were made against Farah’s American coach, Alberto Salazar, and his training partner Galen Rupp in a BBC documentary. Both men deny the accusations. Farah has never been accused of any wrongdoing, but he pulled out of a planned race, the strain beginning to show. My name is getting dragged through the mud and it’s not fair. Iam angry. I need answers. Today, Farah said: That evidence that Salazar’s promised cannot come soon enough for Farah, as he tries desperately to move on. Dan Roan, BBC News. It’s becoming the story of our time - the movement of millions across the globe in search of a better life. The UN estimates that almost 60 million have now fled their homes - half of them children - and are on the move. Germany is among the countries struggling to cope with new arrivals. It’s thought 1+00,000 asylum seekers will end up there this year alone. And among the places hardest hit is Passau on the Austrian border where hundreds of children are being dumped by traffickers. From there, jenny Hill sent this report. Once a quiet border town, now they call Passau the Gateway to Germany. Here’s why. Hundreds of refugees arrive here every day. Some with their families, but we found this one sat alone BITIOFIQ StI’8I’IgâIâS. He has fled from Afghanistan. His mum, dad and younger brother are still there. He’s15. TRANSLATION: The most difficult part of the journey was from Afghanistan to Iran, but Macedonia was bad. What happened to you there? Thieves stole everything from me. Like so many others, he paid hundreds of euros for a lift across the Austrian border. Early every morning, men, women and children are brought here. The traffickers dump them at the side of the road and they’re left to walk down the motorway into the nearest town. The police took these pictures. They have stopped trying to catch the traffickers - too busy, they say, dealing with the human cargo. Officers told us one in ten refugees here is a child travelling alone. They can be as young as six, and they end up in homes like this. These boys tell us they want to study and work in Germany. That they’ve made it here at all seems extraordinary. This is a rich town, and people in Passau want to help. But they had set aside money for flood defences. They’re spending it fast on refugees. TRANSLATION: We’re very surprised that there is no European solution yet to the problem of unaccompanied child refugees, to the refugee problem in general. It is unacceptable that some EU countries refuse to take responsibility. For now, they’re promised food, shelter, somewhere to sleep. What happens next is harder to guarantee. Police are investigating whether a man, whose body was found on the roof of a building in West London, may have fallen from the undercarriage of a plane coming in to land at Heathrow. Another man is in a critical condition in hospital after being found in the landing gear of a plane that had flown all the way from South Africa. It’s not know whether the men were on the same flight. Sarah Campbell has the story. Directly under the Heathrow flight path, yesterday morning a body was spotted on a roof of one of the local businesses. It’s believed the man fell from a plane. A shocking discovery for the people who live and work here. It’s awful, absolutely awful. I worry that it may happen in the middle of the street and there’ll be lots of people around. It shows you how desperate they must be. It’s one thing getting on a migrant boat in Europe, but getting on a plane and taking that sort of risk. Shortly before the dead body was spotted police had been called to Heathrow Airport. A 21+-year-old man had been found unconscious in the undercarriage of a plane which had flown from South Africa. He remains in hospital in a critical condition. So did the two men travel together? Police here in Richmond and in nearby Heathrow are looking into whether they stowed away on the same plane, boarding atjohannesburg Airport, where we are told security has now been stepped up. After the death of a stowaway in 2012, the BBC was given access to the undercarriage area of a passenger plane. The wheels retract up and fill most of this space. It’s hard to believe that anyone could survive an11 hourflight here. It’s a really tight space to squeeze yourself into. The temperature starts to drop. We get down to about minus 60 Centigrade during the last part of the cruise. The oxygen levels will really drop and you really need forced ventilation to be able to breathe. So it would be really difficult. In Richmond, tributes have been left to the unnamed man who died, it appears, a long way from home. Ofsted says it will no longer employ 1200 inspectors - because it believes they are not good enough to judge schools in England. The decision to drop what amounts to 1+0% of Ofsted’s entire inspection team is part of its efforts to improve quality and consistency. Teaching unions have repeatedly criticised the standard of inspections. Trainee doctors are to get financial incentives to become family GPs in parts of England where there are shortages. The Health Secretaryjeremy Hunt wants 5000 more doctors to go into general practice. But in return, he wants GPs to provide a seven day a week service. Here’s our health editor, Hugh Pym. Rural Wiltshire, picturesque and peaceful. Nobody seems to be making too much noise about the state of general practice. At the surgery in the heart of the village, patients can get an appointment on the day if they want one. You sound a bit croaky. So here, doctors feel strongly there is no need to open at weekends, whatever the government may call for. If they had to, they argue it would undermine the service during the working week. We see patients when they want to be seen. That is during the working week, on the day that they want to be seen by the doctor they want to see. That means they don’t need to call out of hours, except iIâ1 S gâI’1UiIâ1â âTT’IâI’gâIâ1Cy. But in health terms it’s a world away from the rural villages when you get to the big towns and cities, where seven day a week opening is already happening in some areas. Hi. This west London practice is open for up to 30 hours on weekdays and eight hours a day at weekends. This is what the government wants to encourage. We’ve had over 100 patients coming in over the weekend. We offer a nurse and a doctor and they are fully booked. The demand is there as far as we are concerned and it’s growing. So we’re looking forward to recruiting more doctors to work for us. But recruiting new doctors is a big problem in some areas more than others. In Wirral, for example, there are about seven GPs per 10,000 patients. In nearby Warrington, the number is fewer than five. In London, Islington has about seven GPs for every 10,000 patients. Whereas Bexley has just four. jeremy Hunt’s answer is financial incentives to encourage trainee doctors to choose general practice in areas which are struggling to fill vacancies. We need to make sure that we channel the new GPs that we recruit into the areas that need them the most and that will need some incentives. We didn’t learn today precisely how these new measures for GPs will be funded. The government line seems to be trust us, we’ll provide whatever money is needed to sustain general practice. But some are sceptical about exactly how all this will be delivered. It’s not clear where the money for this comes from and it’s not clear either that money is entirely the problem. The recruitment and retention of GPs may be notjust about money, but about other issues which seem to be undermining their morale at the moment. Hello. Many GPs say with rising numbers of patients and a higher workload, action rather than words is needed right now. Now, some of you may remember days out like these. NEWSREEL: All the fun of a typically English fair. Margate’s Dreamland in its heyday - the swinging ‘60s.

D’Costa was arrested last year after he approached a 13-year-old girl in this car park while in his wheelchair. He showed her an explicit video of himself engaged in sexual activity with a child. He then offered her money to have sex with him at his flat. When the police searched D’Costa’s Wembley flat, they found videos and diaries. He had meticulously detailed the abuse and filmed it. There were over 100 hours of video footage recovered, which was the most harrowing and sickening I have seen in my 26 years of service with the police. In a statement read out today, one of the victims said how she could not be around men any more because of her experience. Another said she felt dirty because she lost her virginity at SUCi’I B YOUFIQ BQE. The court heard he lured them in by saying he needed jobs doing around the house because he was disabled. But today the judge said, ""The fact you use a wheelchair didn’t inhibit you in the slightest when committing these offences."" D’Costa pleaded guilty to 25 offences, including five counts of rape. He was sentenced to 16 years and will be on the Sex offenders Register for life. Thejudge said, ""I have no hesitation in describing these crimes as a campaign of rape."" When mentioning one of the incidents he told D’Costa, ""You were coercive. You ignored her pleas to stop, her cries of pain and her tears. It was the ugly rape of a 13-year-old child."" We are very pleased that D’Costa has been brought to account. Been found guilty and has received 16 years imprisonment. At his age it’s likely that he probably won’t see the light of day. The police say D’Costa may have abused before and want anyone with information to come forward. He’ll serve at least two-thirds of his sentence, but as the judge said, the impact on his victims will last for life. A bus driver has had her contract terminated after she was caught on a mobile phone camera showing her attacking a pedestrian. The altercation is said to have happened after the driver was filmed allegedly jumping a red light in Waterloo. She is seen gripping the woman around the neck. A man who’s bike was stolen in a vicious attack has spoken out about how the London Ambulance Service refused to send paramedics to treat him. Paul Mullan was attacked on a towpath in Tottenham on Tuesday night. He is in hospital waiting for surgery on his broken leg. London Ambulance Service says it has launched an investigation. It was a fire which devastated a Grade I listed stately home in Surrey, destroying hundreds of priceless paintings and artefacts. Now, nearly two months on, experts say they’re confident that Clandon Park House can be saved. Victoria Hollins reports. Only from the air is the extent of the devastation at Clandon Park clear. The roof, walls and ceilings all collapsed into what is nowjust a shell. The Grade I listed building still isn’t safe to enter. But today, confirmation for the first time the manor house does have a future. Although the inside of the building has really suffered complete devastation, in some parts - the outside of the building, and looking like it is standing up really well. It is almost two months since fire ripped through Clandon Park. 80 firefighters battled for more than 12 hours to put it out. But it spread quickly, engulfing the furniture, porcelain and textiles for which the 18th century manor house was renowned. Work has now begun to prepare the site for the massive task ahead. This morning, structural engineers did their first aerial assessment of the manor house. The work done so far has given a reasonable idea of the damage done to the building itself. What is less clear is what lies beneath the ash, the soot, the beams inside the house. The National Trust is hopeful that some of the artefacts they feared were lost may still be saved. 350 items have already been rescued. That is around one-third of the contents. We are really pleased we were able to save so many things, particularly from the speaker’s parlour, which was a dining room in the north-west corner of the house. We were able to save the porcelain and the silver and also some paintings. And large-scale restorations are possible. Much of Windsor Castle was destroyed by a fire in 1992. It took five years and £37 million to bring it back to former glory. We do learn from that and we will take our lessons forward and share them with the historic buildings and other museums as we go forward. Clandon Park will soon be encased in scaffolding. It will be years before it emerges finally from the ashes. The full cost of converting the olympic Stadium into West Ham’s new home has been revealed today. The London Legacy Development Corporation has put the figure at £272 million, compared to an original projection of £15lI million. West Ham has paid £15 million, with the rest paid for by the taxpayer. It’s time for me to wish you goodnight. I’ll leave you with Darren Bett who has the weather. Not the sort of weather we would choose. A bit of a mixture out there. The sunshine will come through now and again. There’ll be showers around as well. It will not be a washout. We will see the cloud increasing overnight. This is what we got by the end of the night. By then a few spots of rain. Starting off grey, but mostly dry early on Saturday morning. You can see a lot of cloud around. We will, however, during the afternoon, catch a few more of these showers. One or two on the heavy side. The cloud may break later on in the day. 20 Celsius or so. In the evening, we could catch a few heavy and thundery showers. Maybe some hail as well. High pressure not close enough, not a bad day on Sunday. This weather front will slide into bring some rain from the Atlantic. So the outlook, Sunday is likely to be dry, although cloudy. We have the rain as we head into Monday. Good evening. Well, it is this weekend we see the summer sol tis, which means it is the longest day on Sunday. We could do with high pressure driving in some warm summer sunshine. This is our weather headline - sunshine. This is our weather headline - an area of low pressure steering these weather fronts towards the UK. However we look at it, it will be a messy start to Saturday morning. A lot of low cloud. Coastal fog into the south-west. Yes, outbreaks of showery rain, pushing in from west to east. Hopefully later on the weather conditions will improve, with the skies brightening up. With sunshine there could be some sharp showers. A muggy, humid feel to the day. Further north and west by the middle of the afternoon, potentially warmer than we have seen across Scotland and Northern Ireland, highs of 18 Celsius. There’ll be some isolated showers around. Perhaps some breaks, sunny spells into the north of England. I suspect across east Wales, into the East Midlands this is where we will see sharper showers. They will drift towards the south-east. Not everywhere will see showers. It will be muggy, with temperatures up to 22 Celsius. For sporting events it is tricky. For Ascot it could be a drizzly start, brightening up and then we could see showers. There may be interrepublicives -- interre pu blicives - - interrepublictions in interrepublicives -- interrepublictions in play at Queens. Some of the showers may be thundery. They will drift away to the south-east through the night. Weather conditions on Sunday for England and Wales improve. By contrast into the north and west, that weather front enhances further showers. Some heavy, possibly thundery. A cool and breezy feel to the afternoon in the far north-west. Brighter and warmer into the south. Highs of 20-21 Celsius. If you are hoping for a brief respite as we move into Monday, think again. It looks as if England and Wales could see the potential for heavy rain through Monday. There is still a level of uncertainty where it will sit. In the north a cooler flow with showers. Northern Ireland could see the best of the weather on Monday. Grey and disappointing, I suspect, through central and southern parts ",,

Later on BBC London: A female cyclist dies in a crash with a tipper truck this morning- the eighth victim this year. And caring for London’s ageing population, which is set to rise by more than a third in the next decade. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Both sides say they want a deal, and talks to resolve the Greek debt crisis to stop it crashing out of the euro will continue today. But time is running out for Athens to pay its international creditors. Eurozone finance ministers are meeting in Brussels this lunchtime to consider new Greek proposals to extend the country’s bailout programme. Greece has to repay 1.6 billion euros to the International Monetary Fund by the end of the month. Christian Fraser is in Athens for us. Thank you. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, met for several hours on Sunday with Cabinet colleagues trying to thrash out a deal and at the end he came forward with a document which he hoped would be to the satisfaction of Greece’s creditors. The rhetoric was as defiant as ever. They think they have gone a long way, that they have made sizeable concessions and if the unthinkable was to happen this week and Greece was to tip out of the Eurozone, it wouldn’t be the fault of the Germans. Such is the sense of urgency that all the meetings have been brought forward today ahead of a meeting of Eurozone leaders later this afternoon. The word we are getting is that there is still a lot to do. With all the latest, here is Chris Morris. A big day for the Eurozone and most of all, for Greece. Its Prime Minister arrived with new proposals, a good basis for progress, said the European Commission, but plenty of talking still to be done. This is a plan for a substantial and viable solution which would allow Greece to come back to grow within the Eurozone. To meet their targets, the Greeks are offering later retirement ages and some increases in VAT. In return, among other things, they want more explicit commitments. On a day of complex choreography, Eurozone Finance Ministers are meeting this afternoon to try to thrash out the detail. Then, this evening, national leaders of the Eurozone will gather for an emergency summit. It needs to send a clear political signal that a deal is close, otherwise the banking crisis in Greece could spin out of control. Billions of Euros have been withdrawn from Greek bank accounts in the last few days, putting the system under pressure. The Greek government has received no external funding since last August. It will soon run out of money. And the country owes 1.6 billion Euros to the IMF at the end of the month, a default could lead to exit from the Euro. The mood is fluctuating from good to bad and back. After months of fruitless negotiations, it may come down this week to a political decision. just how strong is the commitment in the rest of the Eurozone to keep Greece in? Chris Morris, BBC News, Brussels. As Chris suggested, it is too late to arrange the final tranche of Greece’s bail-out on 30thjune. As is often the case, they will have to find alternative ways. They will have to extend deals or find money from other pots. What there has to be in Brussels today is a strong political signal and it is a meeting the Greek people are following closely. So many times has Greece stood at the precipice that even when the darkest clouds descend, there appears this mood of resignation. They call it ""crisis fatigue"" but don’t mistake the appearance of calm in Athens today for indifference. The Greeks are worried. I have to say it is very aggravating for everybody, especially young people like me. We havejust started families, small kids, it is very uneasy to not be able to plan for the future. People of my age have a big problem with theirjobs. I don’t know. I think it would be better if we go back to drachma. Small savers have taken five billion Euros from Greek banks in seven days, not so much a bank run as a jog. The failure to secure at least a basis for a deal in Brussels today would have far greater implications. At a meeting in Athens on Friday, central bankers warned the country was days from capital controls, the measures that suffocate an economy. To me, to the management of the bank, to the thousands of employees of the bank, Greece has to proceed to find an agreement with our creditors and European partners. No agreement would be a disastrous event. The pressure eased today with European Central Bank has extended emergency funds, but the patient remains on life-support and necks -- next time the ECB will take its cue from these politicians. Alexis Tsipras stirs the nostalgia for the days when Greece stood tall in Europe. He may be testing the patience of diplomats, but here is support is strong. Whether it remains strong depends on the deal he strikes. There are red lines that even under the most intense pressure the Greek Prime Minister can’t afford to cross. The market bounced today and bank shares soared on the back of optimistic sounds from Brussels. The mood has gone from good to bad and back to good again. What with we hearing, Chris? There’s a lot of frustration, a lot of fatigue. These negotiations have been stretching on for five months and negotiations have been stretching on forfive months and here for five months and here we are, a few days from the end ofjune, which was always the deadline for the end of Greece’s current bail-out. Still no-one has any idea whether a deal is going to be done or not. Certainly, a lot of pessimistic noises from Finance Ministers, from the Finns and from the Germans, saying we are a long way from any kind of deal. Some kind of positive signal needs to emerge by the end of today, otherwise, Ithink, the economic pressures on the Greek banking system and from elsewhere will become very difficult to manage, indeed. There’s still optimism around, from those who say look this is the way the Eurozone has dealt with this crisis for most of the last five years. It has waited until the last minute until it has that big political push to some sort of agreement, to kick the can down the road. The difference this time is that for the first time, we have a Government from the radical left, putting forward a different ideological perspective about the whole way the single currency should be run. With that in mind, Chris, the fact that he was elected on an anti-austerity ticket, is there any sympathy at all for Alexis Tsipras’s position? I think there is some sympathy. There is a lot of frustration with his negotiating tactics and anger, a lot of people in Brussels and other capitals feel they have been misled several times about what Greece is trying to achieve. There is sympathy from some about the fact that he is dealing with a population that has been traumatised, really, by the economic measures that have had to be taken. Don’t forget, a deeper recession than any modern industrialised country has ever experienced before. I think people here understand that he’s under that intense political pressure and yet, from most of the Eurozone, particularly from countries in the north, comes the insistence that you have to stick by the rules, you can’t win an election in one country and expect to change the rules for all 19. It has been a tough political lesson for Mr Tsipras, that when you join a single currency, when you are part of the Eurozone, there are some limits to your political power. Yes, Alexis Tsipras, between a rock and a hard place. Thank you. I’m looking at an ATM machine here and there is no queue there. The thing we will be watching closely tonight is a demonstration here in the square because on alternate days and separately the right-wing has been coming out to demonstrate, then the left-wing. Tonight the right-wing and the left-wing are coming out together and that could be quite combustible, Clive. Police in Afghanistan have killed six Taliban militants, after a dramatic attack on the parliament in Kabul. MPs were led to safety after a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb outside, while gunmen tried to enter the building. Our correspondent in Kabul, David Loyn has the latest. EXPLOSION This was how the bomb felt inside the Afghan particle. -- This was how the bomb felt inside the Afghan particle. -- Parliament. ""Don’t panic"" the Speaker said. Members of Parliament tried to find their way out and there was pandemonium in the surrounding corridors. Windows at the back of Parliament were shattered in the blast. And this was the scene outside in the road, a line of cars set alight by the huge explosion. Newly-trained Afghan Special Forces quickly arrived to take up position. The Taliban gunmen were repulsed by police in the Parliament and sought refuge in a building under construction. You can see puffs of concrete chipped away as the police attacked their positions. Firing went on for an hour until the gunmen were killed. As the clearing up went on, the questions were beginning as to how the Taliban got this close to a centre of Afghan power. They said they carried out the attack on the day that the new Defence Minister was to be introduced in Parliament. A passing taxi was damaged. Its driver said his hair was singed by the explosion, his two passengers were injured. Outside, this is the crater of the bomb. It blew open the seats of Afghan democracy. This Kabul attack and Taliban advances in Helmand in the south-west and elsewhere, put pressure on Afghan government forcesjust elsewhere, put pressure on Afghan government forces just at a time when peace talks between the Taliban and the government look more possible than for many years. David Loyn, BBC News, Kabul. David Cameron is promising an end to what he calls the ""merry go round"" of taxing those on low incomes, with the Government handing money back to the same people in benefits. The Prime Minister’s speech comes two days after tens of thousands of people took part in anti-austerity marches. Our Assistant Political Editor, Norman Smith, is in Westminster. Have we learnt anymore today? I think we have, Clive. We already know the Government wants to achieve around £12 billion worth of savings from the benefit budget. We will get the details next month. But today, Mr Cameron gave us a clear steer that he is looking at achieving much of that savings from tax credits. Why? He said he wanted to end the symptom of topping up low pay with benefits. He also talked about ending the merry-go-round of people getting low-paid jobs paying their taxes and then the Government giving them benefits back in the form of tax credits. When you put that together with what else we know, namely the Government have ruled out taking any money from pensioner benefits, the biggest part of the Welfare Budget, they have ruled out doing anything with child benefit, they are unlikely to do much with disability benefit because they have talked about protecting the most vulnerable, that only leaves you the housing benefit budget and of course tax credits. Tax credits are worth a lot of money, around four million of us get tax credits. If you get Working Tax Credit, that can be worth up to £1,900 a year. It seems Mr Cameron is looking at clawing back money from the tax credit budget. This is what he said. We need to move from a low-wage, high-tax society to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society. Indeed, across the country we have been too busy picking up the failure that has gone before. Politically, this is going to be difficult. Today, we also learned how Mr Cameron wants to reframe this argument. He doesn’t want it to be about benefit cuts, paying off the deficit, balancing the books, he wants it to be about welfare reform. He is presenting this as incentivising work, of encouraging people to get more skills, trying to pressurise companies to pay more. He wants headlines about welfare reform, not benefit cuts because benefit cuts suggest you are hurting people, welfare reform suggests you are helping people. Thank you. Britain’s largest nursing union has warned that thousands of foreign staff could be forced to leave the UK, under new immigration rules. The Royal College of Nursing says a new pay threshold will cause ""chaos for the NHS"", because non-European workers have to return home after six years if they’re earning less than £35,000. Here’s our health correspondent, jane Dreaper. He is at risk of having to leave the job he loves. Sandeep, who is Indian, looks after critically ill NHS patients in Kent. He has gained extra qualifications since arriving here, but new rules mean he might have to leave the UK in 2017. If I have to leave this country, then I have to move my whole family to a different country. I have to start my career from the beginning. The hospital where I work is going to lose a skilled and experienced staff. New rules about whether workers from outside Europe can settle here permanently begin next year. For the first time, there is a pay threshold. Salaries need to be at least £35,000 for anyone staying longer than six years. The Royal College of Nursing thinks more than 3000 foreign nurses injuniorjobs will initially be affected and that could rise to 6,500 having to leave by the end of the decade. Here in Bournemouth, where nurses are meeting for their union’s annual conference, there is deep concern that the immigration rules could cause chaos and waste money. The NHS often depends on foreign staff and spends millions of pounds recruiting and training them. Most of those nurses are working in acute hospital wards or care homes, where there is already a shortfall in staff. You are talking about an under pressurised area of nursing which will be further compromised by this. The government announced these changes several years ago as part of the effort to reduce demand for migrant workers. Ministers say they have taken advice from an independent committee and the NHS has had time to prepare. Sandeep and his family hope this situation might change. His union is campaigning for nursing to be officially declared an occupation with staff shortages, so the new pay threshold would not apply. jane Dreaper, BBC News. Our top story this lunchtime.

The world’s most profitable company, Apple says it will now pay artists during a three-month free-trial period offered to subscribers of its new music streaming service. It follows an angry complaint by the American singer Taylor Swift, who withdrew her album in protest at the non-payment of royalties. Apple has been trying to promote its new music service as ""artist-friendly"". Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-jones has the story. She is 25, probably the world’s hottest recording star and now Taylor Swift has forced the world’s most valuable company to backtrack over what it pays artists. On Apple Music... When Apple unveiled its streaming music service earlier this month, it promised a whole new relationship between artists and the fans, who would pay a monthly fee to get access to their music. But then it emerged that during a three month free trial period, the musicians would get paid absolutely nothing. Many were angry but it was Taylor Swift’s open letter describing the policy as shocking and disappointing that made the difference. Apple has not exactly got a track record of listening to critics but it certainly paid attention to Taylor Swift. Within hours of her posting her complaint, the executive in charge of the music service had taken to Twitter of all things to say that Apple Music would pay artist for streaming even during the free trial period. He went on to say, ""we hear you, Taylor Swift"". Many lesser- known musicians and their labels yet that and getting a free service from Apple would stop buying music and they welcomed swift’s intervention. She has spoken out at a very effective moment and has crystallised the thoughts of a lot of people. Apple clearly are very impressed. It is the power that an artist can wield if they choose to do so. Right now, Spotify, which has also been attacked over what it pays artists, is the leading player in music streaming. Apple’s U-turn could be designed to wrong-foot the competition. They are not the only game in town when it comes to streaming. When it came to downloading, they may have been but with streaming, there’s a lot of other players competing with them. Taylor Swift told her 59 million Twitter followers that she was elated and relieved Apple had listened. But whether streaming music will ever give much of a living to many artists remains to be seen.

It’s becoming the most popular of phone scams and today sees the launch of a national awareness campaign. Here’s Simon Gompertz. Another reason to be wary of unexpected phone calls. Hello? Retired railwaymanjoe Anderson, Retired railwayman joe Anderson, once Retired railwaymanjoe Anderson, once Maher of Darlington, told us how fraudsters get him into believing his bank account was under threat and that he should move his savings into a safe account which was in fact bogus. A person like me, 87, being attacked that way, it was far better to be mugged in the street with that money on me rather than being attacked on the phone. I was attacked. Tricked by the fraudster, joe went into his bank and took out £2500 in cash and then carried it down the street to a different bank, into an account, the number given to him by the fraudster, an account which was swiftly emptied. Fraud experts believe many are at risk and worry that cash is going into serious crime, even to support fighters in Syria. What is new is that at no stage does the fraudster have two appear in person. Minerals are going away from the types of telephone scams where they came to collect the card or came to collect cash, although those are still happening. They were putting themselves at potential risk of being arrested. 170,000 neighbourhood watch volunteers are out warning the public this week. It tells you what you need to know. They save £24 million known to have been stolen last year if the thin end of the wedge because people don’t admit they being taken in. Although they don’t report it directly to the police, they say, I had a phone call and someone has asked me to do this. We get the feel that it is happening. Now you can transfer money so quickly over the Internet, fleecing us by phone as become even easier. Simon Gompertz, BBC News, Darlington.

This is the tale of a feline who has certainly used one up on a very unexpected journey. Philip Norton reports. It started out as a routine sightseeing flight over French Guiana, for pilot Romainjantot. But just 17 seconds after lifting off the ground, it suddenly becomes clear there is a very unexpected passenger on board. Crawling from the wing, a shocked cat manages to clamber up to the main frame of the aircraft, where she clings on until the pilot spots his furry stowaway. After his double take, Romain reduces power and turns back towards the runway. His sightseeing passenger is equally surprised to see slightly more than she paid for on the flight. Romain said the cat is the flying club’s mascot and does not know if she got in after the pre-flight check or if he just missed her. Less than two minutes after taking off, all are back down safely with an extra gentle landing. Hairs on end, the relieved cat soon has her paws back on the ground and is said to be doing well. Having used up quite a few of her nine lives. Philip Norton, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Nina Ridge.

Emergency talks in Brussels to try to resolve the Greek debt crisis - but time is running out. A pat on the back for the Greek prime minister, but will Greece’s proposals be enough to stop it crashing out of the euro? They have accepted that the new proposals of the Greek government is a properframework on proposals of the Greek government is a proper framework on which to work. On a day of frantic talks, we’ll have the latest from Athens. Also tonight... Child tax credits - the prime minister signals big changes ahead as the government tries to make £12 billion of welfare cuts. In Afghanistan, a Taliban attack on parliament as gunmen attempt to storm the building. And how Taylor Swift persuaded the technology giant Apple to change On BBC London: Killed by a truck in rush hour. A 26-year-old woman is the eighth cyclist to die on our roads this year. And concerns over how the capital will cope with a growth in its ageing population. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Eurozone leaders are arriving in Brussels tonight for emergency talks to try to resolve the Greek debt crisis and prevent Greece from crashing out of the euro. New proposals submitted by Greece have been described as a ""good basis"" for a deal. But time is running out and it’s unlikely any final agreement will be made tonight. In a moment, the view from Athens, but first, this report on the latest diplomatic manoeuverings from our Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas in Brussels. They seem to happen every week now. Europe’s crisis summits. At the centre of everyone, Greece and its struggling economy. Tonight, the Greek prime minister faces the toughest political decisions of his life. He has held out for better terms from Europe. But time is running out, with financial chaos looming. What is important now is to have a look at what they propose. We have lost a lot of time. It is not five to 12, it is 30 seconds to 12. There are just nine days until Greece could default on its debts. Last night, the Greek prime minister finally put a new deal on the table. It is enough, he hopes, to unlock Europe’s cash. This is time for a substantial solution. Europe is trying to coax him into ditching some of his election promises, in return for the money. Behind closed doors, finance ministers were picking over the details today of Greece’s new offer. Still not satisfied. On pensions, Greece may now reform early time and plans. It may also look at VAT rates, and tax increases. The Greek finance minister, usually combated, slipped away quietly. The details need to be hammered out. Yet again, a moment billed as make or break for Greece has come and gone with no agreement, but this time, it seems the Greeks may be starting to make some kind of concession. No deal today? may be starting to make some kind of concession. No dealtoday? No concession. No deal today? No deal today, no. Frustrated? Frustration is a big word, but we had hoped for more, that is certainly true. It is to this group around the table which Greece still owns more than 200 billion euros. They are still waiting, they insist, for Athens to meet their terms, even as the deadlines loom. New taxes on Greek businesses and the wealthy are just some of the proposals that the Greek government hopes will help to balance its books. Our economics editor, Robert Peston, is in Athens and has been talking to Greece’s economy minister about their attempts to head off the debt crisis. Some are at last in Greece after the big economic freeze. They’re just may be a bailout deal with its creditors within sight. Or so the economy minister, who learned much of his economics in Newcastle, told me. They have accepted that the new proposals of the Greek government is a properframework on proposals of the Greek government is a proper framework on which to work on. And with some adjustments, which will be the issue of discussion over the next day or so, we will end up with a proper, technical solution as well. The austerity already forced on Greece by the International Monetary front and Eurozone governments has been incredibly painful. National income has fallen by 25%. Unemployment has soared also by 25%. Wages have been squeezed, pensions have fallen by around a third. But the national debt remains unsustainably high, and 180% of GDP. It is a dreadful mess. The cost to Greece of not doing a deal to avoid default would be colossal. The boss of one of its big banks told me that anxious investors are withdrawing billions from their accounts. The Greek banking system cannot continue in the current situation of every day losing hundreds of millions of euros by depositors who are fearful. For Greece, no agreement would be a disastrous event. We have no way to measure to date what would happen IF we follow that path. I am afraid, as an economist, that it would be a disastrous event for everybody. Do you think the government is doing a good job in the negotiations? At the moment, no. Hopefully it will do something better. The government was a new government, and maybe some mistakes were made. But for sure, they are honest people, they are people who are trying for the best of Greece. We are in a very difficult situation, and we cannot find a normal solution. With a deal seemingly in sight, there is a gentle wind perhaps blowing from Brussels which could at last nurture an elusive Greek and Eurozone recovery. Our Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticus joins us from Brussels. No agreement tonight, more talks on Thursday - this could go right to the wire? Absolutely, it could. Angela Merkel said that this is only going to be a consultation tonight. Those Greek proposals came in so late in the day. So, it will go to the leaders when they return here later in the week, which could be the final chance. What they fear it is, as Robert was saying, those anxious investors withdrawing their money, and a run on Greek banks, so they need to nail things down. They are pleased I think that they have proposals which they can work on from Greece now, but there is a lot of hard bargaining to go. In all of these crises, deadlines come, but deadlines in Europe can be elastic, too. The Prime Minister has signalled there could be big changes to tax credits paid to those in work, as the government looks at ways to save £12 billion from the welfare bill. David Cameron has vowed to end what he called the ""merry-go-round"", where people in low paid jobs are taxed by the government, and then then given back in the form of welfare. Our political editor Nick Robinson reports. If you are in favour of cutting the benefits bill, who do you think should pay? Children, maybe? orthe unemployed. What about people who rent their homes, the disabled, or pensioners? The idea of cutting £12 billion from the annual welfare budget is frankly a bit hard to grasp. Ink of it this way. It is the equivalent of a government identifying 12 million people and asking them for £1000 a year back each. We know who they will not take the money from. It will not come from pensioners, it will not come from child benefit. But in the budget in two weeks’ time, it is clear that some of it at least will come from tax credits. The prime minister did not spell out his plans today, but decoding them is not very hard. It is what I call a merry-go-round, people working on the minimum wage, being taxed by the government, and then the government giving them back that money, and more, in welfare. We need to move from a low-wage, high tax society to a higher wage, from a low-wage, high tax society to a higherwage, lower a higher wage, lower tax society. Lower welfare will mean cuts to child tax credit, received by millions of people on lower incomes, weather they are in or out of work. The money you get now depends on how many hours you work and how much exactly you earn. Families can receive up to £2780 per child per year. A couple with one parent working full-time with two children can claim, but only if earning less than £33,000 per year. can claim, but only if earning less than £33,000 peryear. Up than £33,000 per year. Up to £5 billion could be saved if child tax credit were cut back, say, to the level it was when it was first introduced by Labourjust over a decade ago. Watching closely what ministers decide will be this lone parent, whose earnings as a nursery worker in east London are topped up by £6lI a week in child tax credit. She says it is the unemployed and not her child who should bear the brunt of cutting the welfare bill. If you are going to cut it, then maybe you should look at what else money is going out too. Before looking at cutting it for a child. Saving anything like these sorts of sums could hit more than 3.5 million low-income families. Labour are lining up to oppose any such move. People who get tax credits are not abusers of the welfare system, they are people going out to work but still low paid, and hitting them is wrong and unfair. Last Thursday in Downing Street, the Prime Minister chaired a meeting of the Chancellor and the Work and Pensions Secretary to try to agree the welfare cuts. I understand they have some way to go. Much of the detail may therefore not be unveiled until the autumn. So, benefit cuts are coming, that it is families with children, not the elderly, who are once again top of the target list. We st West Midlands Elyse say two sisters, aged six and seven, have been killed in an accident in Birmingham. The crash happened yesterday. A 3lI-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving. The girlfriend of a man accused of murdering his 16-year-old stepsister has now also been charged with her murder. Watts was found dead at a house in Bristol earlier this year. Her stepbrother, 28-year-old Nathan Matthews, was arrested at the time. Today, police said new evidence has also led to his girlfriend Shauna Hoare being charged with Becky’s murder. In Afghanistan, Taliban gunmen have launched an attack on the Parliament in Kabul. The assault began with a suicide bomber at the gates, then six gunmen tried but failed to storm the building. A woman and a child were killed and around Ao people were injured. From Kabul, David Loyn reports. EXPLOSION SCREAMING This was how the bomb felt inside the Afghan parliament. We could see a lot of dust and a lot of smoke inside the hall. But in the meantime, the ceiling, the decoration material in the ceiling, also fell. What was interesting for me was at that moment you lose control of your mind for a few minutes. You don’t know where to go or what is happening. A line of cars was satellite by the first huge explosion. You can see puffs of concrete chipped away as the police attack their positions. As the clearing up went on, the questions were beginning as to how the Taliban got this close to a centre of Afghan power. They said they carried out the attack on the day that the new defence minister was to be introduced in Parliament. This Kabul attack and Taliban advances in Helmand in the south-west and elsewhere in the country put pressure on Afghan government forces, just at a time when peace talks between the Taliban and the government looked more possible than for many years. The bomb blew open the gate at the seat of Afghan democracy and a reminder of the Taliban’s continuing ability to disrupt this country. Our top story this evening: Emergency talks in Brussels to try to resolve the Greek debt crisis but time is running out. A warning over the use of stop and search as the Met considers increasing the tactic after a rise in knife crime, plus marking the centenary They’re called legal highs - synthetically made drugs that can be bought over the counter and online. But despite being legal, they’ve been linked to a number of deaths in recent years. The government is now set to ban them, like Ireland did five years ago, with the issue being debated in the House of Lords tomorrow. But as our home editor, Mark Easton, has discovered, efforts to stamp out some of these potentially lethal products have been thwarted because of problems with the legislation. People celebrated when Ireland introduced a blanket ban on all new psychoactive substances - the synthetic drugs often sold as legal highs. But on one Monaghan estate, the drugs are back. And they’re killing people. Dirty, dirty drug. They smoke it that much, it will kill them. It killed my brother Michael on December 5th, and my best friend. He took his own life. David told me police are powerless to act. Super strong synthetic cannabis is openly traded on the estate, leaving addiction and desperation in its wake. You’ve bad thoughts appear, up here all the time. You see there, even there, a number of wrappers there. Clockwork Orange, Happyjoker, evidence of the use of synthetic highs is scattered like leaves across the estate. The legislation doesn’t seem to be working here. The availability of it seems to be just endless. It’s as easy got now as cigarettes. David says dealers and users can easily buy the drugs online. It comes in a box. You open the door, the man’s got your box, sign your name, it’s in your hand. That’s it. Other Irish towns have seen protests against perceived police inaction against drugs. One public meeting in Monaghan turned to anger after the local police chief explained that despite the blanket ban on psychoactive drugs, Clockwork Orange was legal. Scientists here at the police laboratory in Dublin were unable to provide evidence that would stand up in court. Even though Ireland’s psychoactive drugs laws were specifically introduced to deal with such drugs, the scientists here couldn’t prove that they were technically psychoactive. No-one has been prosecuted in Monaghan and across Ireland, five years since they introduced the laws, there have been only four successful prosecutions. There are problems, it’s not perfect legislation. I wouldn’t say they could carry on with it, but in order to sustain the prosecution in the courts, we’ll have to prove they are psychoactive. And you haven’t been able to do that in Monaghan? No, not yet. The body of Sharon’s son was found hanging from a tree in Monaghan. He’d been trying to beat his addiction to synthetic cannabis. A family friend found him. The scream he let out, I knew then. Iran up, but I knew as soon asl heard the scream. That scream is in my head when I go to sleep and when I wake up. Ijust can’t get that out of my head. Whose fault is it that this has gone so badly wrong on this estate? I think more so the gards. The police? Yeah, because they know who’s selling it here. They know who’s selling it and theyjust turn a blind eye to it. The UK government says it wants to copy the Irish legislation to ban legal highs in Britain, but some politicians are demanding any new law must wait until Ireland’s experience can be assessed. United Nations investigators say that both Israel and Palestinian militants may have committed war crimes during the conflict in Gaza last year. The UN team said it had substantial evidence of ""serious violations"" during the fighting which claimed more than 2,000 lives. Their report was rejected by both sides with the Israeli government saying it failed to recognise the ""profound difference"" between Israel’s moral behaviour and that of the militants. Thousands of foreign nurses working in the UK could be forced to go home because of new immigration rules - that’s the warning from the Royal College of Nursing. It says a new pay threshold for migrants will ""cause chaos"" for the NHS and will mean money is wasted on recruiting new staff. Here’s our health editor, Hugh Pym. For new father Sandeep, whose job is looking after critically ill patients, the idea of asking any foreign nurses to leave the UK doesn’t make sense. He arrived from India a few years ago. He believes limits on nurses from outside Europe will leave the NHS as the loser. If the rules don’t change, all these nurses have to go back to their country, or to different countries, and the other countries are actually benefiting from having experienced staff. Whereas the NHS are training them and they are losing these experienced and skilled staff. Under the new rules, nurses from outside Europe will only be able to stay more than six years if they earn £35,000 a year or more. Nursing unions say that could leave the NHS short-staffed. Most of those nurses are working in Acute Hospital wards or care homes where there already a in staff. You’re talking about an under pressurised area of nursing which will be further compromised by this. More nurses are needed by the NHS, but these rules may mean that around 3300 nurses from outside Europe may have to leave the UK from 2017. Staff shortages cost £3.3 billion last year, that’s what the NHS in England hatters as Benidorm agency nurses and doctors to cover BQEFICV FIUFSES and dOCtoIâS to COVEF QBPS. agency nurses and doctors to cover gaps. There have been calls for more training places. Last year27,000 -- 37,000 people across the UK were turned away. But the government said more nurses were being trained and on the migration issue, advice was taken from independent experts. They advise us about which occupations to put on the so-called shortage occupation list, the ones where they fear skills shortages will develop. They haven’t put nursing on that list. It can cost NHS employers thousands of pounds to recruit a nurse outside Europe and Sandeep believes that money wasted if they have to leave after six years. The pop star Taylor Swift has persuaded the technology giant Apple to change its tune over paying musicians for songs played on its new music streaming service. Many other artists had also threatened to boycott Apple music after it said it wouldn’t pay royalties for songs streamed during a three-month trial period. Our technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-jones, report. She’s 25, she’s probably the music industry’s biggest star and now Taylor Swift has forced the world’s most valuable company to backtrack over what it pays artists. Apple’s new music streaming service promised fans access to the catalogue of all their favourite artists for a monthly fee. Then it emerged that during a three-month free trial, the musicians would get absolutely nothing. There’s been widespread anger, but it was Taylor Swift’s open letter describing the policy as shocking and disappointing that made the difference. Apple hasn’t exactly got a track record of listening to critics, but it certainly paid attention to Taylor Swift. Within hours of her posting her complaint, the executive in charge of the music service had taken to Twitter of all things to say, ""Apple Music will pay artists for streaming ""even during customers’ free trial period,"" and going on to say, ""We hear you, Taylor Swift"". She has spoken out at a very effective moment, and has crystallised the thoughts of a lot of people. Apple are clearly very impressed. It is the power that an artist can wield, if they choose to do it. For emerging artists, the news is a relief. Gilbert’s band, Crystal Fighters, know that streaming is the future, but would like to make just a bit more money from it. I think this will make a big difference because it’s about time that these big streaming companies started paying and compensating artists fairly. For us, streaming is the future. Ourfans love it and more fans are streaming our music than buying it or downloading it. Last year, Taylor Swift removed her music from another streaming service, Spotify. By making peace with her now, Apple may hope to convince both artists and fans that it has their interests at heart. In football, England are in action in the Women’s World Cup in Canada this evening, playing Norway for a place in the quarter finals. If they make it through, they’ll face the hosts Canada. Katie Gornall reports from Ottowa. This could be where history is made for England. Or for This could be where history is made for England. Orfortheir for England. Or for their World Cup journey across Canada, it could be the final destination. Much is at stake in Ottawa. In a few hours, they will face Norway in a hot and humid stadium. You don’t have any second chances so we will give it absolutely everything. We’ll take absolutely everything. We’ll ta ke the absolutely everything. We’ll take the game to Norway and hopefully play exciting football so people at home can be proud. There is cause for hope.

England’s players now enjoy more support on and off the pitch than ever. Their strength and conditioning coaches form part of the 19 strong backroom staff they having gathered.

The allocate over £12 million annually to the women’s game, more than any other European country. In a World Cup year, Eli million is spent at the elite level, more than Norway ‘s budget of £1.6 million. 20 years ago it was all very different, when England played in the 1995 World Cup the players had full-time jobs and trained in parks. Marion Spacey is now employed by England and says they are still playing catch up.

For England the goal is more immediate, to go further than they’ve gone before. A pilot and his passenger got a fright when they discovered an unusual stowaway during a flying lesson in French Guiana. Seconds after take-off, a cat appeared on the ultralight’s wing and inched its way nervously towards the pilot and his passenger. The pilot managed to turn the aircraft around and land it safely with the cat still clinging on. But that’s one cat who’s definitely lost one of its nine lives. Time for a look at the weather- here’s Matt Taylor. He’s more worried about these right now! From cats to pollen. Conditions far from perfect for hay fever sufferers over the next few days. Today we’ve had a break from it thanks to moderate levels and rain. In the next few days it starts to shoot up, especially across southern and western areas. Tomorrow, dry weather and sunshine helps, but it will be a chilly start. Especially across western areas. Down eastern parts, lively showers and some rumbles of thunder. The shower was clear away onto the continent eventually. In the West, temperatures will drop to two or three Celsius by first light in the morning. Chile for a late june day. Soon warming up. Missed and fog clearing with a lot of sunshine through the day. The breeze not as strong so it won’t feel as chilly as it has done this afternoon. The cloud will break and allow some sunshine through. Sunniest towards the south and west in the afternoon and temperatures back to levels where they should be at this time of year. It gets warmer still into Wednesday, especially across eastern areas. In the West, it clouds over through the day, splashes of rain in Northern Ireland and western Scotland. It stays dry, sunny and warm to the south and east. By Thursday, the low-pressure has the remnants of tropical storm bill amongst it. It will stay to the West to finish the week. Another fairly warm and humid day across eastern areas on Thursday. Elsewhere, one or two showers and the sun will come out every now and again.

Good evening. There’s growing evidence tonight that Greece and its international creditors are inching towards a deal to avert a full—blown financial crisis. Eurozone leaders are meeting in Brussels considering the latest Greek proposals including further taxes on business and the wealthy. The Greek government says it’s now hopeful it can avoid defaulting on its outstanding debt and stay in the single currency. But the French government warned that ‘not everything’ had been resolved. For the latest in Brussels tonight, let’s join our correspondent, Damian Grammaticas. The leaders talks, we understand, wrapping up here and now with the wrapping up here and now with the first signs of some progress in first signs of some progress in many, many weeks and this is, after many, many weeks and this is, after the first real substantial the first real substantial concessions, it seems, by the Greek concessions, it seems, by the Greek side last night. They came too late side last night. They came too late for the leaders to be able to agree for the leaders to be able to agree anything today, but they are the anything today, but they are the reason we believe progress has been reason we believe progress has been made and the reason the leaders will made and the reason the leaders will be back here on Thursday trying to be back here on Thursday trying to clinch a deal there. It has felt clinch a deal there. It has felt like a never ending saga, but now like a never ending saga, but now the end may be looming. Greece the end may be looming. Greece really is running out of money. It really is mnning out of money. It could really is running out of money. It could default on its debts in days. could default on its debts in days.

What is this political gambling. what is important this political gambling. What is important is to get information important is to get information about what they want and what they about what they want and what they propose, because at the moment we propose, because at the moment we have lost a lot of time, it is the have lost a lot of time, it is the factor 12, it is 30 seconds to 12 so factor 12, it is 30 seconds to 12 so is important to find solutions. Last is important to find solutions. Last night, Greece’s premise to put a new night, Greece’s premise to put a new deal on the table with new deal on the table with new concessions. Enough he hopes to concessions. Enough he hopes to unlock your’s concessions. Enough he hopes to unlock your’s cash. I think it is unlock your’s rash. I think it is time for a unlock your’s cash. I think it is time for a substantial and viable time for a substantial and viable solutions will stop with a playful solutions will stop with a playful slap, Europe is trying to coax into slap, Europe is trying to coax into ditch some of his election promises ditch some of his elaction promises in return ditch some of his election promises in return for the money. Behind in return for the money. Behind dosed in return for the money. Behind closed doors, finance ministers were closed doors, finance ministers were picking over the details of picking over the details of Greece’s the offer. Still not Greece’s the offer. Still not satisfied. Hurdles remain before the satisfied. Hurdles remain before the bailout deal is done. On pensions, bailout deal is done.

Looking today? Looking today. Looking today? Looking today. Frustrated? Frustration is a big Frustrated? Frustration is a big word, but we had hoped for more. It word, but we had hoped for more. It is to this group around the cable is to this group around the table that is to this group around the cable that Greece still owes 200 billion that Greece still owes 200 billion euros. There are still going to euros. There are still going to wait, they insist, for Athens to wait, they insist, for Athens to meet their terms, even as the meet their terms, even as the deadlines loom. In Athens today, the economy minister told the BBC that the new proposals on raising taxes meant that there could be a deal ‘within days’. Greece will risk crashing out of the single currency if it doesn’t repay a 1.6 billion Euro loan to the IMF by the middle of next week. Mr Stathakis was speaking to our economics editor Robert Peston, so let’s go live to Athens where Robert has the latest. Well, it has been a roller—coaster Well, it has been a roller-coaster day for Greeks. Well, it has been a roller—coaster day for Greeks. For me, it started day for Greeks. For me, it started when I saw the chairman of one of when I saw the chairman of one of the countrrs when I saw the chairman of one of the country’s biggest banks and he the countrrs biggest banks and he said to the country’s biggest banks and he said to me he was so concerned about said to me he was so concerned about the rate at which anxious savers the rate at which anxious savers were withdrawing cash from banks were withdrawing rash from banks like is were withdrawing cash from banks like is that he feared the like is that he feared the government would be forced to impose government would be forced to impose restrictions on the amount of cash restrictions on the amount of rash that restrictions on the amount of cash that savers could take out and that that savers could take out and that would have been a shattering blow to would have been a shattering blow to the ability of banks to support the the ability of banks to support the economic recovery. Then I went to economic recovery. Then I went to see the economy minister and he told see the economy minister and he told me that, for the very first time, he me that, for the very first time, he felt that the government had felt that the government had presented proposals to euros leaders presented proposals to euros leaders that they would see as a credible that they would see as a credible attempt to balance the books and he attempt to balance the books and he was hopeful that they would see that was hopeful that they would see that as the outline for A.D. And so it as the outline for A. D. And so it has appeared. as the outline for A.D. And so it has appeared. For the first time in has appeared. For the first time in months, there is has appeared. For the first time in months, there isjust a sign has appeared. For the first time in months, there is just a sign that months, there is just a sign that the long, long years of economic the long, long years of economic misery here may, I say May, the 20 misery here may, I say May, the 20 those. Some are at last after the those. Some are at last after the big economic freeze. Whispered big economic freeze. whispered softly, but big economic freeze. Whispered softly, butjust made the of the softly, but just made the of the wizards softly, butjust made the of the wizards creditors is inside. Or so the economy minister told me. They have accepted the new proposals of the Greek government is a proper framework on which to work on, and with some adjustments, it will be an issue of discussion for the next day or so. We will end up with a proper, tactical solution as well. The austerity already forced on Greece by the International Monetary Fund and Eurozone government has been incredibly painful. GDP, and national income, has fallen by 25%. Unemployment has soared also to 25%. Wages have been squeezed, pensions have fallen by around a third, but the national debt remains unsustainably high at 180% of GDP or national income. It is a dreadful mess. There is around 45 billion euros of rash in the There is around 45 billion euros of cash in the system. Others, they rash in the system. Others, they have dogged cash in the system. Others, they have dogged the ground and bid. The cost to Greece of not doing a deal to avoid default would be colossal. The boss of one of its big banks told me, because anxious investors are withdrawing billions from their accounts. The Greek banking system cannot afford, cannot continue with the current situation of everyday losing hundreds of millions of euros by depositors who are fearful of default. For Greece, 3 non—agreement would be a disastrous event. We have no way to measure today what would happen if we follow that path. I’m afraid, as an economist, it would be a disastrous event for everybody here. Do you think the government is doing a good job in the negotiations? Until now, no. Hopefully, it will do something better today. The government was a new government, and maybe they made some mistakes. But for sure, they are honest peopla, peopla who are trying for the best of Greece. We are in a very difficult situation, and we can’t find a normal solution. So, with a deal to avoid default and stay in the Euro seemingly inside, there is a gentle, balmy wind, perhaps blowing from Brussels, which could perhaps finally nurture that elusive Greek and Eurozone recovery. And if all goes to plan, it will take years to heal a devastated take years to heal a devastated economy and battered nation. So how much real progress has been made today and is a deal now likely? Our Europe editor Katya Adler in Brussels. What is your view of the kind of what is your view of the kind of progress that What is your view of the kind of progress that has been made today progress that has been made today and are we getting closer to A.D., and are we getting closer to A.D., do you think? As those leaders met do you think? As those leaders met their meeting here in Brussels there their meeting here in Bmssels there was a their meeting here in Brussels there was a sense of weary optimism, was a sense of weary optimism, though not from all circles. The though not from all cirdas. The German though not from all circles. The German finance minister remained German finance minister remained very tight—lipped indeed. Why is it very tight-tipped indeed. why is it then very tight—lipped indeed. Why is it then that after these five months of then that after these five months of acrimonious negotiations, that there acrimonious negotiations, that there is still a will to do a deal with is still a will to do a deal with Greece at the very last minute? It Greece at the very last minute? It is because, despite their is because, despite their differences, all the parties in this differences, all the parties in this have one major thing in common, they have one major thing in common, they want Greece to stay inside Eurozone want Greece to stay inside Eurozone and that is the bottom line. Most and that is the bottom line. Most Greeks support the Prime Minister Greeks support the Prime Minister and his tough stance in and his tough stance in negotiations, but remember he was negotiations, but remember he was voted in an anti—austerity, not an voted in an anti-austerity, not an anti-EU voted in an anti—austerity, not an anti—EU ticket. For the rest of the anti-EU ticket. For the rest of the Eurozone anti—EU ticket. For the rest of the Eurozone leaders, it is less about Eurozone leaders, it is less about been desperately fight against been desperately fight against Greece and more about being Greece and more about being desperate to find a deal to save the desperate to find a deal to save the Eurozone. They’re worried that if Eurozone. Therre worried that if Greece Eurozone. They’re worried that if Greece leaves it was a bad message Greece leaves it was a bad message to the markets. The US is also to the markets. The US is also worried about the instability and worried about the instability and behind—the—scenes is pushing for a behind-the-scenes is pushing for a deal with behind—the—scenes is pushing for a deal with Greece. It once solid and deal with Greece. It once solid and United in the face of an aggressive United in the face of an aggressive Russia. Despite all of this, nothing Russia. Despite all of this, nothing is finalised in EU circles until is finalised in EU circles until everyone is agreed. Tonight, we are everyone is agreed. Tonight, we are executed with Greece, but it is by executed with Greece, but it is by no means guaranteed. David Cameron has given a strong hint that the government is considering changes to tax credits for people in work. It’s part of the government’s search for £12 billion of savings in the welfare budget. The prime minister said he wanted to end what he called the ‘ridiculous merry—go—round’ of taxing people on low earnings and then handing money back in benefits. More details are expected in the Budget next month, as our Political Editor, Nick Robinson, reports. 1. II If you are in favour of cutting the benefits bill, who do you think benefits bill, who do you think should pay? Children may be, or the should pay? Children may he, or the unemployed? should pay?

The idea of cutting £12 billion from the annual welfare billion from the annual welfare budget is frankly a bit hard to budget is frankly a bit hard to grasp. Think of it this way. It is grasp. Think of it this way. It is the equivalent of the government the equivalent of the government identifying 12 million people and identifying 12 million peopla and asking identifying 12 million people and asking them for £1000 a year back asking them for £1000 a year back each. Now, we know who they won’t each. Now, we know who they won’t take the money from. It would come take the money from. It would come from pensioners, it would come from from pensioners, it would come from child benefit, but in the budget in child benefit, but in the budget in two weeks time, it is clear some of two weeks time, it is clear some of it at least will come from tax it at least will come from tax credits. The Prime Minister did not credits.

The UK government is being urged to delay its plans to ban substances known as ‘legal highs’ because of concerns about how effective the legislation would be.

The technology giant Apple has reversed its payment policy to musicians after the singer Taylor Swift said her new album 1989 would not be available for streaming on Apple’s new service. Swift had addressed an open letter to Apple outlining her concerns. Now Apple says it will pay artists for music streamed during free trial periods. Our Technology Correspondent, Rory Cellan—Jones, has the story. # Nothing but had blood... She’s 25, she’s probably the music industry’s biggest star, and now Taylor Swift has forced the world’s most valuable music company to backtrack over what it pays artists. On Apple Music... Apple’s new streaming music service promised fans access to the catalogue of all their favourite artists for a monthly fee. Then it emerged that during a three—month free trial, the musicians would get absolutely nothing. There has been widespread anger, but it was Taylor Swift’s open letter describing the policy is shocking and disappointing, that made the difference. Apple hasn’t exactly got a track record of listening to critics, but it certainly paid attention to Taylor Swift. Within hours of her posting her complaint, the executive in charge of the music service has taken to Twitter, of all things, to say Apple will pay artists for streaming even during customers’ free trial period, and going on to say, ""We hear you, Taylor Swift."" She has spoken out at a very effective moment and crystallised the thoughts of a lot of people and Apple clearly are very impressed. It is the power that an artist can wield, if they choose to do. Apple’s service is designed for a world where people opt to stream, rather than download. For a monthly fee, services like Spotify, Deezer and Tidal allow users to access an online catalogue. The money involved is tiny. The average artist on Spotify could be paid just half a penny per play. Apple wanted to pay artists nothing during a free trial of their service. Now there is the promise of a little more for bands like Crystal Fighters as they try to adapt to this new way of making music pay. I think this will make a difference because it is about time these big streaming companies started paying and compensating artists fairly. For us really, streaming is the future. Our fans love it and we have more fans that stream our music than buy or download it. Taylor Swift told her 59 million Twitter followers that she was elated and relieved that Apple had listened, but whether streaming music will ever give much living to most artists remains to be seen.

And the ""will he, won’t he"" is over- Zac Goldsmith decides whether to enter the mayoral race. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Eurotunnel says large numbers of migrants are attempting to get into cars and lorries backed up at Calais, because of a strike by French ferry workers. Ships aren’t being allowed to leave or enter the port, because of the dispute. Eurotunnel said the number of migrants in the area is the highest they have ever seen. Here’s Richard Galpin. The traffic chaos in Calais today, a chance for the thousands of migrants here to easilyjump on lorries heading to Britain. Some openly talking with the drivers. But not all are successful. This group was spotted by the driver and chased away. The police are also getting involved to push the migrants back from the motorway. The problems began in the early hours of the morning. Port workers in Calais went on strike, setting up blockades at the entrances to both the ferry terminal and Eurotunnel. The action is expected to continue until tonight. It is estimated at least 3000 migrants are now living in these makeshift camps in Calais. Many recently arrived from the Mediterranean. They include Afghans, Sudanese and Eritreans fleeing violence and persecution back home. Almost all are desperate to reach Britain by whatever means. And the expectation is that the numbers stuck in Calais will steadily increase over the summer. Making scenes like this ever more common. james Kleinfeld is a coach passenger who witnessed the migrants on the motorway at Calais. As soon as we arrived on the French side, I started seeing dozens, we counted approximately 50 people, migrants, hanging around the junction, just after the exit from the Eurotunnel train station. You can normally see them when you are approaching the ferry. That is where the police have moved them on, and you can see them when you are approaching. But I approach the channel quite often and I never see any of them hanging around that part. They are on the motorway, alongside the motorway, and in the direction coming into the UK. There are miles of traffic, lorries that have stopped, and dozens of the RS stands, riot police from France, the situation is completely out of control. -- DRS fans. Our correspondent Simonjones is in Dover. But this into context. We know there are a record number of migrants trying to get into Europe this year. Here in Dover we have ferry is unable to cross the Channel and we have lorries queueing up, desperate to make thatjourney. But over in Calais, the real effect of the strike is being felt with the migrant situation. But lorry drivers will tell you that what they are seeing today is what they experience on a daily basis as they come through Calais, migrants trying to get on the lorries in broad daylight. It is thought that between three and 1+000 migrants sleeping Calais, many desperate to board lorries bound for Dover. Some get through. We see migrants on top of lorries on motorways year apprehended by the police. But the numbers are difficult to know. The Home Office tell us that last year they prevented 1+0,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally, double the number the previous year. But the ferry companies have got involved this lunchtime. P&O say that the French government should step in that to sort this out and deal more effectively with the migrant situation. Thanks, Simon. As many as 5,000 lives could be saved every year in England, if GPs follow new guidelines on diagnosing cancer. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says it’s now updating its guidelines, recommending that in some cases where the disease is suspected, patients are sent for tests before referral to a specialist. Our health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson reports. AGP A GP surgery, the first port of call for patients with concerning symptoms. Cancer affects one in every two people. Getting prompt treatment is key to survival. It is hoped new guidelines will mean that GPs do not miss the early warning signs. Michael lost his wife, Helen, to cancer. She wasjust 1+6. He says that doctors did not take it seriously when she complained of symptoms. He is convinced that GPs need to be more proactive about the disease. It is time it was done. I think that doctors should not be afraid to think, not actually say it, but to think that there might be the possibility someone may have cancer. Until now, GPs have been encouraged to consider firstly which cancer a patient might have and then to cross check it with symptoms. Now thatis to cross check it with symptoms. Now that is being turned on its head, and new guidance will set out to symptoms first and then suggest possible cancers. Experts believe that this could save thousands of lives. We know through international comparison that in the United Kingdom we are not doing as well at treating cancer and diagnosing cancer as we should be. Compared to other European nations, approximately 10,000 people a year in England and Wales are dying of cancer more than should be. It’s estimated half of those are because people are being diagnosed late. This guidance, the purpose of this guidance, is to address that. And to speed up treatment rather than waiting for patients to see specialists, GPs will be encouraged to order CT and MRI scans and internal investigations, such as endoscopies. Experts say the new system must be properly funded. Diagnosing more cancer earlier should be cost saving to the NHS in terms of avoiding treatment costs, so we hope that there will be savings but it will be expensive to put more patients through four tests. It is important that the NHS invests in the areas where they will be stretched. Campaigners say the new approach should notjust target Campaigners say the new approach should not just target cancer cells, but is also needed to combat other diseases. Further talks are underway to finalise a deal, guaranteeing Greece will be able to meet its debt repayments by the end of the month. Eurozone leaders have expressed optimism there will be an agreement to help prevent Athens crashing out of the single currency, but they say a lot of work remains to be done. Christian Fraser is in Athens. Yes. The word from the Greek newspapers this morning is that there are 8 billion euros of new measures on the table. The word from the Prime Minister is that that is as far as he should be expected to go in the context of the austerity of these people. Farfrom go in the context of the austerity of these people. Far from the optimism we here in Brussels, there is no euphoria here. Most see it as a sticking plaster. They know that at some point there has to be tough negotiations about debt and debt relief. With all the indications that holds for other European governments. Nobody here in Greece would mistake the promise of a deal for a new dawn. If crisis is averted, that will still depend on heavy lifting in Brussels, and the fundamentals of this economy remain the same. A banking system on life support, a population that feels it is being slowly strangled by tax and the posterity. TRANSLATION: I believe it will be the same. Now one can manage anything. It will be painful. We must not make a deal. The finer points of high wire negotiations are still to be hammered out but today, the Greek newspapers carried some of the early proposals. A sliding scale of higher taxes for the rich, starting with those earning over 30,000 euros. The rich, starting with those earning over 30,000 euros. Middle earners to the rest taxes for business. At some point before the weekend, Alexis Tsipras will need to present his agreement to the Greek parliament. Already, politicians on the left of his party are revolting. He may well need the votes of opposition MPs. But the longer term problem is that there is no talk of debt relief in the deal and now one in Greece, very few in Europe, believe that the size of the dead and the terms for repayment are in any way sustainable. -- repayment are in any way sustainable. -- of the debt. And then there is the issue of fulfilling the deal. People here would say that the government’s record in raising taxes is second to none but collecting them, a different story. We have two one half times more self-employed than the average country. -- half times more self-employed than the average country. -- two and a half. Self-employed people tax of eight more in any country. In the UK, France, as in Greece. And for that reason, we have a discrepancy close to 3% of GDP in terms of lower revenues. But the most toxic element of the negotiations has been the uncertainty of where it will end. The people of Greece cannot plan for their future and they do not know from one day to the next whether their money is safe. Perhaps the best we can say of this deal is that Greece survives in the Eurozone at least for now. And at the moment no deal has been agreed. Rememberthat if And at the moment no deal has been agreed. Remember that if and when the final tranche of the bailout is paid, Breese will-- Greece will need more money and more reform. Thanks, Kristian. Counter terrorism police in West Yorkshire will be giving their response today, to allegations made by the husbands of three sisters from Bradford who are thought to have taken their children to Syria. Keith Vaz, the chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee is meeting officers following criticism the police pressured the women to keep in touch with a brother who’d alreadyjoined the so called Islamic State. Our Home Affairs Correspondent Dominic Casciani is in Westminster. What are we expecting today? A week ago we had an emotional press conference from two fathers of the nine children believed to be in Syria. Today, it is all about questions for the police. The fathers believe that somehow the police were complicit in the women’s decision to go to Syria because they say that the police counterterrorism officers encouraged the sisters to maintain contact with their brother, who was already in the war zone. Effectively, their brother, who was already in the warzone. Effectively, police the war zone. Effectively, police at a reckless disregard in the words for the safety of the family. West Yorkshire Police and the north-east counterterrorism unit clearly reject those suggestions, but they are going to be meeting Keith Vaz in the next few minutes to discuss the concerns of the family. Keith Vaz has kept his council ahead of that meeting but he said last night that he had concerns about the nature of the relationship between the police and the fathers and said that they certainly need to have some kind of meeting at a senior level very soon and Bradford MPs are respected to meet the Home Secretary later this afternoon. Lots of questions and you today. Maybe some answers later on. Thanks, Dominic. An independent review is to examine why so many children who’ve spent time in care, end up in the criminaljustice system. The Prison Reform Trust says those aged between 10 and 17 are five times more likely to be in trouble with the law, than other children. Here’s our Social Affairs Correspondent, Alison Holt. For too many young people in the care system, young offenders institutions and other secure units have become the next stop for them when they leave the care of local authorities. The review announced today wants to understand why that is happening and what can be done to change it. Russell went into care aged 13. In the seven years since then, he has been in and out of trouble, including spending time in a young offenders institution. Ifl If I had support around me when I was younger I would have stayed smart and innocent. But now I have so much anger. Ido not have smart and innocent. But now I have so much anger. I do not have anybody supporting me. It is not much different to supporting yourself. At the charity where Russell gets help, they hear similar stories from many care leavers. A lot of them talk about crushing loneliness, feeling depressed, not knowing what to do with their lives. And when you look at those sorts of feelings, you see how easy it could be for some of them to become involved in the wrong sorts of influences. And the statistics on children who have been in care becoming caught up in the criminaljustice system are criminal justice system are disturbing. criminaljustice system are disturbing. Fewerthan criminaljustice system are disturbing. Fewer than 1% of children in England are in local authority care. But a survey of 15 to 18-year-olds in the young offenders institutions found that one third of boys and 61% of girls had spent time in care. Maud Leeming will lead the Independent review which has been set up by the Prison Reform Trust. The purpose of the enquiry is to see whether or not it is possible to do something so that the years in care are not wasted years, but they are the one opportunity that our satiety has truly help these young people to turn their lives around so that they can become fulfilled and useful members of our community. The government maintains it is already doing a lot to improve the lives of care leavers but says it looks forward to seeing the findings when the review report next year. Our top story this lunchtime: Eurotunnel says migrants are breaking into cars and lorries backed up at Calais, because of a ferry workers strike. And still to come, the Hollywood blockbuster that’s set to become part of the school science curriculum. Later on BBC London, we hear from the granddaughter of a woman beheaded in her garden, as a court finds her killer not guilty of murder. jailed for smuggling cocaine - Surrey cricketer Chris Lewis on how he hopes to stop others from doing the same. It’s the sci-fi blockbuster that explores space and time, and now a leading scientificjournal has suggested the film Interstellar should be shown in classrooms. Its Oscar-winning visual effects have apparently led to new scientific discoveries, and some experts in the American journal of Physics hope the film might help more youngsters get interested in space. Our science correspondent Pallab Ghosh has the story. just behind Saturn is a wormhole created by a black hole. Astronauts travel through it to another galaxy to save the human race. Get ready to say goodbye to our solar system. It’s the stuff of science fiction - or is it? Here we go. The visual effects are absolutely breathtaking. But not only that, independent experts say the black hole and wormhole that you can see are scientifically accurate. And they say the film should be shown in school science lessons. It feels like time to try to inspire another generation to look outwards to the stars again. When I was a child, people were still visiting the moon, the first probes were being sent into the solar system and indeed eventually beyond. It’s time to get back to that. The visual effects were created by designers in London, who used physics equations to develop their computer-generated graphics. A literal heart of darkness. The team here developed special software to calculate the way light rays travel across warped space around the black hole. This is something the scientific community apparently had not seen before. When a theoretical physicist is contemplating a black hole, they are thinking about very specific aspects of it. They are not thinking about trying to make a beautiful image for a Hollywood film. We found by doing that, by doing all the simulation physics work needed to create these images, it revealed this extremely beautiful pattern which revealed some more science to us. The wormhole produced in the film is unlike any other seen in Hollywood films. By actually going to the real physics and saying, what does the physics tell us about this thing, we discovered this incredibly beautiful object. Hollywood blockbusters have become much better recently at getting the science right, but never before has one discovered something completely new. A 25-year-old man who beheaded an elderly woman in North London has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. The Old Bailey was told that Nicholas Salvador had already beheaded two cats and was searching for more to kill when he came across 82-year-old Palmira Silva. Daniel Boettcher is at the Old Bailey. What more was said in court today? An unusual feature of this briefcase, which lasted less than 2 days, was that both the prosecution and the defence agreed that the proper verdict would be 1 of not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. After hearing the judge’s briefs summing up this morning and deliberating for 1+0 minutes, that was the verdict the jurors returned. During the trial, the prosecution said there was no dispute Nicholas Salvador had killed Palmira Silva. The court heard he went on what was described as a rampage, killing two cats believing they were demons. He attacked a car containing 2 people he was staying with. Before approaching Mrs Silva. Hejumped into her garden and attacked her. Much of this was captured on a camera on a police helicopter overhead, as was the period up to his arrest. The court heard that at the time of his arrest, there were signs of mental illness. The court heard two psychiatrists had discovered he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Thejudge paranoid schizophrenia. The judge imposed paranoid schizophrenia. Thejudge imposed a hospital order and a restriction order without limit of time. He will be detained at Broadmoor secure hospital. Thank you. The justice Secretary, Michael Gove, says the criminal courts in England and Wales are riddled with inefficiency and bureaucracy and need urgent reform. He says there’s currently a two-tier system, in which the wealthy have access to a gold standard of legal help, while victims of crime are badly let down. Our legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman reports. Robed and ready for action, Michael Gove, the new man atjustice, arrived in challenging times. This is what Chris Grayling, his predecessor, had to deal with. For the 1st time ever, lawyers on strike and on the streets in protest against cuts to legal aid fees. Today, Mr Gove gave his view of our justice system. There are two nations in ourjustice system. The wealthy international class can choose to settle cases in London with the gold standard. Everyone else has to put up with a creaking, outdated system to see justice done in their own lives. This is the kind of thing he was talking about, the haves like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich who spent millions fighting a civil case. How do you fix the inequalities in the system? We urgently need to reform our criminal courts, make sure the six regions are efficient, unnecessary things are stripped out, information is exchanged by e-mail. Evidence must be served in an effective way. With hundreds of millions of pounds recently cut from the legal aid budget, will efficiencies and modernisation alone create a1 nationjustice system? The idea of1 nation justice nationjustice system? The idea of1 nationjustice is essential, it’s the right idea but you won’t achieve it by carrying on with the legal aid cuts which are achieving the opposite, to tearjustice. Today the newjustice Secretary was on something of a charm affective. -- two tierjustice. Ifind nothing but good will, wisdom and generosity of spirit. He is confident he has the money to fix it. England’s women are through to the World Cup quarterfinals after beating Norway 2-1 in Ottawa. It’s their first ever win at the knockout stage. They’ll now face the hosts Canada in the last eight on Saturday. Here’s our sports correspondent Katie Gornall. Never before have England had this feeling - their first win in a World Cup knockout match. Whatever happens next, this is a team that will persevere. Norway had reason to feel confident. Veterans of seven World Cups, they soon took charge. With England doing all the chasing, Karen Bardsley was in for a busy first half. It was thirsty work in the Ottawa sun, and not the type of mouthwatering football the fans had hoped for. The cool heads were elsewhere, and soon after the restart, Gulbrandsen was perfectly placed to give Norway a deserved lead. Now the heat was really on England. But just as all the old English certainties began to resurface, there was the captain Steph Houghton to jolt them to life. 1-1, and now game on. In Mark Sampson, England have a coach unafraid to roll the dice. Fittingly, his two substitutes created the winner. jodie Taylor and jill Scott combined to find Lucy Bronze, her first shot of the tournament and one of the goals of the tournament. Oh, yes! An absolute belter! Norway had been blasted out of the contest, England fired into the quarterfinals. Normally I don’t hit them, I pass. In training, people are like, why don’t you shoot when you’re on the edge of the box? So I wasjust like, right, I’m going to shoot! Having been second best for most of this match, England have shown something that arguably they’ve not shown before in a World Cup - resilience. They will need that for their next game - a quarterfinal against the hosts Canada in Vancouver. schools, Sir Chris Woodhead, who had motor neurone disease, has died.

His credits included numerous other high-profile films, including Avatar, Braveheart and Aliens. Here’s David Silitto. Sad, romantic but also hopeful. The 2nd you hear it, you can only be in 1 place, the deck of the Titanic. james Horner’s Oscar-winning score was more thanjust a powerful piece of music. It created the whole feel of the film. You are looking at something absolutely heartbreaking and you are feeling something heartbreaking, and you are hearing something that is a wistful, slightly melancholy thing, but it’s positive in a way, very pretty. I think that’s dramatically what gets you. And then, Apollo 13, another film in which the mood begins with music. james Horner had composing credits on 158 productions. Two Oscars, 10 nominations. Born in Los Angeles, he studied at London’s Royal College of music. His other great love was flying. The wreckage of his plane was found in a national forest in California. Among the tributes today, Ron Howard, who worked with him on seven films. Seth McFarlane, who said he left a spectacular music legacy. And Russell Crowe, the star of A Beautiful Mind. The challenge in that film was to create the feeling of a brilliant but troubled brain. Avatar took you to another world. The sound, epic, romantic, the modern blockbuster.

Last night, some had clear skies and the lucky few got a chance to see the all and we have had pictures, this1 the all and we have had pictures, this 1 from Oxfordshire. Another spot that was favourable was across Wales. This guys, which meant it got quite chilly, down to 3 spectacular views. We have clear skies in western areas, temperatures climbing nicely, it is much cooler further east. The afternoon will be dry and we will see some sunny spells, but always keeping the best sunshine further west. always keeping the best sunshine furtherwest. Much further west. Much more of the eastern England. Temperatures for south-west England and Wales will climb to around 21. Quite widely around 18 -19. The cloud is having a real effect. The East Coast, 11+-15, just 13 in Newcastle with a breeze off the North Sea. A bright afternoon from Northern Ireland and south-west Scotland, but northern Scotland has a thicker cloud with patchy outbreaks of rain. It will stay there this evening and overnight. Elsewhere, we will start off dry with clear spells, but later on in the night we will expect cloud to arrive across Northern Ireland with a few spots of rain by dawn. Not as cold as last night, many places seeing the day start at 10 . Some early brightness across England and Wales. A different feel to the day for Scotland and Northern Ireland, much cloudier. Temperatures down at around 15-16, but England and Wales keeping hold of the fine weather. Wednesday at an Thursday, gradually warmer. -- Wednesday and Thursday.

And the female cyclist killed start a collision with a killed in a collision with a a Glasgow to Turkey flight that he didn’t know what country he was in. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. All day there have been extraordinary scenes at Calais with migrants massing in their hundreds, trying to get on trucks heading for the UK. The lorries have been forced to stop and queue outside the port because of French strike action - and desperate migrants have been trying to take advantage of the situation and climb on board. Eurostar services have been cancelled. The Foreign Office has warned drivers in the area to keep their doors locked. The number of migrants in a camp near Calais has swelled to more than 3,000 since April. Aid workers have called the situation there catastrophic. Our correspondent, Lucy Williamson, is in Calais. Lucy, what is the latest there now? Well, you can probably see behind me, these vehicles have been backed UP me, these vehicles have been backed up along this stretch of motorway all day and what’s been really striking is the mood that we’ve noticed amongst the migrants here. They’ve seemed relaxed, almost leisurely as they walk from vehicle-to-vehicle and there is a worry on the part of the authorities here that this could be the start of a very difficult summer for Calais and for Britain. The latest frontline in Calais’s battle with its migrants. The main highway into the Chunnel. Migrants used to grabbing chance whereas they can, saunter past their targets, spoilt for choice and drivers know. They know open vehicles make it less attractive to hide. It is frightening. We have locked the vehicle doors. We are frightened people might try to get in. In the last few minutes we have seen people trying to board vehicles here. One climbing on to the roof of a truck. This trafficjam has been caused by strike action near the tunnel entrance but the Calais authorities say they’ll block the port themselves if Britain doesn’t do more to help. Britain has put up security fences around Calais’s ferry port but this stretch of motorway is far less protected. The end of a trail that leads all the way back to the Mediterranean sea. It is not new for police here, though, this footage filmed by officers on patrol several weeks ago, shows the growing ranks and growing confidence of their opponents. The number of migrants here has swelled to 3,000, an all-time high with more on the way. Some are reaching the UK via British smuggling networks, which pay drivers to ferry people across. On the British side of the channel, today’s disruption has caused long delays. But those waiting on the other side are just as numerous, just as impatient to cross. At both ends of its territory, France’s barriers are being reinforced but behind them, the pressure keeps building. And in a sign of how this crisis is playing out across Europe, Hungary hasjust said it’ll stop observing a key principle of EU asylum rules, that migrants should be processed in the first EU country it gets to. A Government spokesman said Hungary had to look after its own population, ""The boat is full"", he said. GPs in England are being urged to fast-track cancer testing to reduce the number of people who die as a result of late diagnosis. It’s estimated 5,000 lives could be saved every year if GPs follow new guidelines for detecting cancer. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is recommending that when the disease is suspected, patients are sent for tests before being referred to a specialist. Here’s our health editor Hugh Pym. Helen Bald died of breast cancer at the age of A6. Ten years before that, according to her family, she went to a doctor but was told she was too young to have cancer. Her husband, Michael, believes her cancer should have been picked up then, especially as there was a history of the disease in her family. It was the denial by the doctors and the - family. It was the denial by the doctors and the - I would say the lack of knowledge of the doctors that caused the initial problem and the misdiagnosis especially with cancer being in the family and her telling the doctors, repeatedly. To try to minimise late diagnosis, new guidelines have been issued to GPs. The aim is to encourage them to refer more patients for tests or specialist appointments and ultimately save lives. Cancer survival rates are not as good as in many other countries. For example, fewer than 80% of patients in the UK and Ireland survive breast cancer for five years or more, whereas it is more than 86% in France and for coal on cancer, just under -- is more than 86% in France and for coal on cancer, just under -- colon cancer, just under 52% survive five or more years against 62% in Germany. So if more patients are going to be referred to scans or other tests, going to be referred to scans or othertests, it other tests, it raises the question of whether the NHS is able it handle the extra volume of work which seems likely to follow these new cancer guidelines being introduced. There are fewer scanser per 1,000 patients in the UK than in several other leading economies and fewer radiologists and there are warnings the system will be overstretched. It could be serioust the system will be overstretched. It could be serious t could mean people who have cancers and other serious conditions could face longer delays. We know already some patients are waiting more than a month for X-rays and scans and that will take longer if we are scanning more people. There has been a which had spread welcome for the new focus on early diagnosis, but equal little a call for more investment in testing and treatment to ensure the NHS can raise its game in tackling cancer and doing the best for patients. A man who beheaded an elderly woman in North London will be detained indefinitely in a secure hospital after being cleared of murder by reason of insanity. Nicholas Salvador, who’s 25, was suffering from a severe psychiatric illness when he attacked 82-year-old Palmira Silva. Daniel Boettcher reports. This report contains images some may find distressing. . The 82-year-old was attacked in her back garden. She was preparing her lunch and was unaware of what was taking place a few yards away. Scotland Yard has released this footage taken from a police helicopter. The man being filmed is 25-year-old Nicholas Salvador. The court heard he had gone on the rampage, first killing two cats because he believed there were Will they were demons then smashing down fences, kicking a door and a car and eventually approaching the home of Palmira sill va. He jumped into her garden, stabbed her and beheaded her. It was an attack that left the family devastated and unable to comprehend it. It is hard to comprehend what happened. Still to this day you think it is a nightmare and you are going to wake UP nightmare and you are going to wake up and everything will be fine. During his trialjurors heard evidence from two psychiatrists he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, both the prosecution and defence agreed it the verdict should be not not guilty on due to insanity. The judge made an order Nicholas Salvador should be detained indefinitely at a hospital. Police said he had not been known to authorities. It is unusual that somebody with that sort of paranoid schizophrenia has not been in touch with the mental health services. It has happened but that makes it more important that members of the public take notice when somebody behaves in a strange way. In a victim impact statement, Palmira’s daughter said her death had torn their lives apart. Stock markets in Europe rose today as a deal between Greece and its creditors to solve the country’s debt crisis looks closer. But in Greece there’s concern about the government’s proposed new austerity measures which include changes to pensions and VAT. This afternoon pensioners in Athens took to the streets to protest. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston reports from the Greek capital. Greece - no longer drowning. Well, a chance of sailing into calmer waters, if its government builds on yesterday’s progress and reaches a deal later this week with creditors to avoid a devastating default. But the deal requires a host of higher taxes and more from those who can afford these. Here at this magnificent marinia, it may be difficult to see Greece as a country in dire financial straits. This place has always had extraordinary members of immensely wealthy people but they’ve been super adept at hiding their income and taking their assets and cash offshore, which is one reason why the government is increasing its luxury tax and including within its scope, for the first time, these beautiful yachts. This man is a top Athens lawyer close to the country’s rich and powerful. One of the problems we have is our elite have not developed this sense of, you know, helping the country and so forth. The problem is there is hostility between the private sector and the government because the government traditionally here in Greece has not been helping people to, you know, make money, so these people made money outside of Greece or in some kind of a war with the government. So their relationship needs to improve. To make all this, it is a way that is very difficult. This owner of a plastic mouldings manufacturer is something of a maverick who never gives up. Afterall, he skied for Greece, a country with not a great deal of snow, in three Olympics. How worried are you that taxes look like they are going up on businesses? We worry. We don’t know if we will survive. You can see that. All these taxes made something like 50% of the companies to stop working. I don’t know what will go on, but we are afraid, you can understand that and one thing we’ll need, is to be stable, to go and know that tomorrow and the next month what we decided today will be for the next years or months ahead. Blimey, a bit of a balancing act for Greece’s government. In living up to its promise not to massively cut pensions or most people’s wages, it’s loading up taxes on the wealthy and companies but if they stop investing or move abroad, Greece will find it even harder to pay its massive debts. Chaos at Calais as hundreds of migrants try to board lorries headed for the UK but stranded by a French strike. And still to The ownership of much of Scotland’s countryside could become the subject of a battle between landowners and the Scottish Government after the publication of its Land Reform bill. It proposes to give communities a right to buy private land for sustainable development and to reintroduce business rates of tax for shooting and deerstalking estates. From the island of Islay, our Scotland Correspondent james Cook reports. Isla, the Queen of the Hebrides, home to 3,000 people, but most of the island is owned byjust a few wealthy men. Could that be about to change? Tony hopes so. He’s been campaigning for land reform for years. We would like to put forward a land reform case where we could persuade larger estates to maybe sell off a bit of land. Instead, he argues, tenants are leaving their rented plots for the town or the mainland, reluctant to invest in land they do not only. ~ -- do not own. An example of a house that’s a typical house that’s not been lived in for a long time. Could be sold off and developed by local people. There’s other farmhouses like this dotted all over the island, which used to be family farms with families in them. Farmers also worry about the lack of security that comes with being tenants, rather than owners. These fields have been in my husband’s family for over 100 years, passed down through all of my generations. When Alisdair White’s sister died without a will to lead to look back control of the family farmland. Devastated. Because it had been in the family for so long. We are having another Highland clearance. It’s another Highland clearance. Keep them down. Keep them altogether. Get them a group. Keep them herded up. The Laird in question owns a third of Isla. He says he was following the law. He claims that the Whites were not suitable tenants and he defends the feudal system. We’ve been here for 160 years, we care about it. Were not milking it. We have ourselves never been out taking out a bean out of the place. We’ve always ploughed everything back in. In terms of, it’s all stayed on the island. Who owns the land is such a fundamental question. It’s been stirring passions for centuries. At the heart of the debate is another question. Should the land be used for private gain or for the common good? For some, the land reform bill will not be radical enough but plans to end is tax relief for shooting estates may force landowners to sell if they are blocking development have prompted talk of Mugabe style land grabs. This is not land grabs, this is about sorting out those areas where economic development, which is after all in the public interest, has been hampered by poor landowners and the way it is managed. The ministers on behalf of the people of Scotland should have the tools to intervene and make sure the community is able to invest their future. So, we are approaching a new battle an old ground. With promises of radical reform certain to meet resistance from the established order. The justice Secretary, Michael Gove, has called for urgent reforms to the courts system to make it more efficient and fairer. Mr Gove said the service was split- offering more to the wealthy than to the poorest in society. But some lawyers dismissed Mr Gove’s words as ""whitewash"", claiming the government’s squeeze on legal aid would ""reinforce the two-track nature of ourjustice system"". Our Home Editor Mark Easton reports. London’s courts have become a magnet for foreign high rollers beating a path to what is seen as the international gold standard of justice. What about everyone else? The court system is failing them badly according to the newjustice Secretary herself. The waste and inefficiency is in such a system are obvious but perhaps more important is the human cost. The poorest are disproportionately the victims of crime and are the victims of a dysfunctional system. His promise of one nationjustice rings hollow to Karen, she claims that the court system causes huge distress to families like hers as she goes through a painful divorce. The length of the process, the paperwork, then knocks all the time. It makes you feel worthless. It’s not surprising there are two nations in the justice system if all the rights for those who most need help to protect them from poverty and other things have their legal rights taken away, that’s why there is a two nations system. Last year, lawyers and legal aid providers went on strike in protest at cuts imposed by Chris Grayling. Michael Gove said he would review the impacts of such cuts, introduce telephone and video hearings and replace paperwork with online court submissions. It is often argued that the court system is stuck in Dickensian times. Based on antiquated technology. Now Michael Gove says he has £750 million to bring the justice system into the 21st-century. The cost of raw is too great and there are too many delays and modern technology allows us to do things so much better and we need to invest properly in that. Michael Gove is a committed reformer who wants to work with the judiciary to transfer -- transform the courts. But introducing new technology will be much more difficult than making speeches to do that. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder following a house fire that killed three people in Derbyshire. Amy Smith, who was 17, died along with her six-month-old daughter Ruby-Grace Gaunt and Ed Green, also 17, at flats in Langley Mill on Sunday. Police said they are still working to establish the cause of the fire. The former chief inspector of schools, Sir Chris Woodhead, has died at the age of 68. He had motor neurone disease. He was head of Ofsted for six years until the year 2000 and had fierce clashes with teaching unions in his drive to raise standards. The former Education Secretary David Blunkett - with whom Mr Woodhead had open disagreements - paid tribute to him. Chris Woodhead was very brave in tackling motor neurone disease and in that way he conducted himself in the education debate and others. On occasions we had incredible clashes I’ve got great respect for the fact that his underlying desire was to raise standards in every school in every part of the country. Thousands of children enter the care system each year, often because of abuse or neglect at home - and the sad fact is many of them will end up in trouble with the police and imprisoned. Now a review has been launched to try and find out the reason why and break the cycle of care to custody. Our social affairs correspondent, Alison Holt has more details. For too many young people in the care system, young offenders institutions and other secure units have become the next stop for them when they leave the care of their local authority. The review announced today wants to understand why that is happening and what can be done to change it. Russell went into care aged 13. In the seven years since then, he’s been in and out of trouble, often feeling on his own. If I had the support around me, I would have stayed and been smart and sweet and innocent. It’s the fact of, I’ve got so much anger and I’m not used to anyone supporting me, it’s generally very much different to supporting yourself. At the charity where Russell now gets help, they hear similar stories from many care leavers. A lot of them talk about really crushing loneliness. About feeling depressed, not knowing what to do with their lives, when you look at those sort of feelings, you start to see how easy it could be for some of them to become involved with the wrong sort of influences. In England, statistics on children who have been been in care becoming caught up in the criminal justice system, are disturbing. The most we should show over 68,000 children in local authority care, that’s about 0.6% of all children. But a survey of 15-18-year-olds in young offenders institutes found 33% of boys and 61% of girls had spent time in care. The purpose of this enquiry is to see whether or not it is possible to do something, so that the years in care are not wasted years but they are the one opportunity our society has to help these young people to turn these lives around. The right help can make a huge difference. Danielle now mentors young girls who, like her, have been in care. She spent time in a young offenders institution but when she got support, her life changed. It wasn’t until I went to the girls group and being with good professionals who took time with you, you realise that there’s consequences of your behaviour. Actually, you’re affecting other people’s lives. The government maintains it is already making life better for care leavers but says it looks forwards to seeing the review findings next year. Now England’s women have made a little bit of football history, winning their first ever game in the knock out stages of a World Cup. Their 2-1 triumph over Norway last night sets up a quarterfinal against the hosts. Our Sports Correspondent Katie Gornall reports from Ottawa. Never before have England had this feeling. Their first win in a World Cup knockout match. For their Welsh coach, there was a sense of pride in his players and a feeling they have more to offer. It is going to be England’s 23 against the whole of Canada. They are looking forward to it. They are not used to playing in front of many spectators. They will be ready for it. Soon after the restart, Gulbrandsen was in the right position to give Norway a deserved lead. But, just as all the old English uncertainties started to resurface, there was their captain Steph Houghton to bring theircampaign to life. Lucy Bronze, her first shot of the tournament, one of the goals of the tournament. COMMENTATOR: Oh yes! What an absolute belter! Normally I don’t hit them, normally I pass but in training people were, like, why don’t you shoot on the edge of the box? You’re always there. I was, right, I’m just going to shoot. Some of the players train today while others had the day. Later today, they will travel to Vancouver for a quarterfinal against there. They have stuttered rather than surged into the quarterfinals. They have history with Mark Sampson’s side. The crowd may be against them in Vancouver but they are picking up their own fans along the way. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Matt Taylor. When is it going to feel like summer? Temperatures are set to rise but it is a question of how long it will last. Today it has felt more like autumn. Temperatures will be rising tomorrow. We saw a clear skies last night. Some of you saw the aurora. There is a chance that you will see those lights on the northern horizon. You might see it in clear skies are further south but in northern and western parts of the UK, more cloud developing. Coolest parts in the eastern areas. A better day to come tomorrow. We will see more cloud developing across western areas. Hazy sunshine later with temperatures rising. There may be a threat of a splash of rain further north. Much milder than it was this morning. That will be the case across Scotland. Cloudier in the West first thing. The rain will spread erratically eastwards throughout the day. Rain will return to Northern Ireland in the afternoon. Much of England and Wales will stay dry. Further spells of hazy sunshine. This is where we will see the warmest weather. Even the mid and high teens away from the rain. A muggy and cloudy night with patchy rain and drizzle at times will last into Thursday morning. Always a bit cloudy in western areas but where the cloud breaks, temperatures will shoot up. The warmest weather in the south-east corner. Orkney and Shetland sticking around 11 or 12 degrees. Friday, a little bit more cloud around with some splashes of rain. The weekend, fresh but bright starts. A reminder of our main story. Chaos as migrants try to board lorries in Calais.

Welcome to BBC London News with me, Riz Lateef. Thousands of Eurostar passenger journeys in and out of St Pancras International have been disrupted. It comes after French ferry workers set fire to tyres outside the Channel Tunnel, forcing its closure. Eurostar say it’s cancelling trains for the rest of the day. Let’s get more on this from Katharine Carpenter, who’s at St Pancras International. Katharine. Yes, Eurostar have been asking people not to come to St Pancras, but it seems what that would not everyone has got the message. They are still turning up with bags and suitcases. The staff here are trained to give out as much information as possible, but in truth, no one seems to really know when the Channel Tunnel is going to reopen. I havejust spoken when the Channel Tunnel is going to reopen. I have just spoken to one family who told me they have tried to rebook their train, and they have been told the first one they can get is six o’clock tomorrow night. This all unfolded after ferry workers in France went on strike. They gained access to the tracks, where they blocked it up with rubble and set fire to tyres, and it meant the Channel Tunnel had to close completely. Some trains stuck outside the tunnel on the English side have returned here to St Pancras, but nothing else has arrived or left here since this afternoon, and it has caused misery for thousands. European holidays and business journeys stopped in their tracks. We couldn’t get out of Florida for two days because of planes, and now ",,

It’s been a day of chaos and disruption in Calais, where thousands of migrants are living rough, hoping to make their way to the UK. A strike by ferry workers led to long queues of lorries and cars, which were then targeted by migrants trying to find a way across the Channel. The port of Calais and the Channel Tunnel were closed for most of the day, and Eurotunnel said there had been a record number of migrants in the area. Our correspondent, Lucy Williamson, sent this report from Calais.

Migrants used to grabbing chances where they can, saunter past their targets - chances where they can, saunter past their targets - spoiled for choice.

It’sjust frightening, seeing everybody here, wondering - cars. It’sjust frightening, seeing everybody here, wondering - we’ve locked the vehicle doors. We’re frightened people might try to get in. I’ve seen videos on TV about what was happening. I thought it was exaggerated. However, being here today myself, you know, they’re just casually walking as you were trying to open one door, wouldn’t work, go to another one. It was literally leisurely Today’s chaos was caused by staff at one ferry operator, protesting plans to wind up its cross-channel service. Their fires halted the running of trains and cars through the tunnel. Open the door wider for migrants to steal across. Injust a door wider for migrants to steal across. In just a few minutes, door wider for migrants to steal across. Injust a few minutes, we’ve seen several migrants too to board the vehicles backed up here, one of them even climbing onto the roof of a truck. This trafficjam has been caused by strike action today near the tunnel entrance. The Calais authorities say they’ll block the port themselves if Britain doesn’t do more to help. Closing the port would be, says Calais’s deputy mayor, a smack for David Cameron. # Intransigent the British in particular are showing that they despise the people of Calais.

But behind the barriers, the pressure is building. Lucy is in Calais for us now. How do you read the situation tonight, given that France and Britain are saying that the other side should be taking responsibility? Yes, you can probably see the traffic is still queueing to get into the tunnel behind me. Groups of migrants are still trying to get on board. Having spent the afternoon here, I can tell you that the frustration among the authorities is really growing. You’ve heard it from Greece. You’ve heard it from Italy, you’ve heard it from France. At every stage ah, long the route, from the Mediterranean to Calais and ultimately to London, bottle necks are appearing. It’s putting real pressure on borders and on governments. Those calls are growing for a pan-European solution. One sign of the pressure we saw today, Hungary came out and said it would no longer respect the EU principle that migrants had to claim asylum in the first country they got to. When it comes to Hungary, the government said, this boat is full. Thanks very much once again. The BBC has seen powerful new evidence of the plight of civilians in Yemen, where civil war has led to thousands of deaths. Following the overthrow of Yemen’s government, a Saudi-led coalition launched a campaign of airstrikes to slow the advance of Houthi rebels backed by Iran. More than 2,600 people have been killed in the fighting since March. It’s estimated that more than 21 million people - 80 percent of the population - are now in need of humanitarian aid. The United Nations has warned of a ""looming catastrophe"". Our Middle East editor, jeremy Bowen, is one of the few Western journalists to reach Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. A warning that there is some harrowing evidence in his report. just reaching a hospital counts as a miracle. After three months of war, Yemen’s health care system, never strong, is collapsing. Sana’s main hospital keeps going under severe strain. Away from these beds, 60% of Yemenis have no access to medical care. When Ahmed, a migrant from Ethiopia was caught in an air strike, he was travelling through Yemen to cross into Saudi Arabia to work. The insides of his lungs were burnt as well as his skin. Even breathing is agonising. Sanaa was captured by hugies -- breathing is agonising. Sanaa was captured by hugies -- Huthis last September. For the last three months, without invading, the richest Arab countries have been attacking Yemen, the poorest. They haven’t forced them to give up the territory and arms they’ve captured. This is the de facto president. He denies Saudi accusations that they are in league with Iran, Saudi’s biggest rival. They’re part of a largely home-grown fight for power. But the Saudi intervention makes Yemen’s war part of the Middle East’s most significant confrontation. Between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Howls the war going to finish? Intransigent all the people from all the -- translation: All of the people from all the world, we stand with you in this crisis. You send the message that the siege is a war of genocide against the people of Yemen. The economy has virtually collapsed. Sanaa is paralysed, focussed on survival. The Saudi-led blockade has stopped almost all fuel supplies. No fuel means no mains water or electricity. A tank feeds these taps for two hours a day. Layers of war are breaking Yemen. In the last week there have been car bombs outside mosques, claimed byjihadists also fighting. Since the Saudi bombings started Al-Qaeda has taken more territory. Many civilians have died in the bombing. Here, because they live just a tin fence away from a senior military commander. This is shrapnel from the attack that destroyed their homes. He showed off a damaged copy of the Koran, next to his wrecked house and car. I saw the kid in the ground with his head cut open, his brains out and it was really - open, his brains out and it was really - there’s no words to describe what I saw. So how many dead kids were there here then? Five. From this family a loan. The five were small? Yes, a five-year-old and a six-year-old. His two sisters, one of them were beheaded. Some people sympathise with the Saudis. Right now everyone just hates them. The Saudis say they have a clear political objective in this war, to restore the ousted president and to send a strong message to the Iranians that they can’t meddle in Saudi Arabia’s backyard. But the question is: Is this the way to achieve that? At the hospital in Sanaa the doctors say the Saudi blockade stops them getting the drugs they need to treat people who’ve been burnt in air strikes. This two-year-old is going to survive. But they can’t do anything about his pain. His mother said their house was destroyed in the air strike. Some home coming. The latest evidence of the suffering of Yemen’s people in the civil war, withjeremy Bowen and cameraman Nick Millard. As many as 5,000 lives could be saved every year in England, if GPs follow new guidelines on diagnosing cancer. Fast-track cancer testing is to be extended to reduce late diagnosis. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has issued guidelines recommending that GPs order certain cancer tests as standard, rather than waiting for a consultant’s advice. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, has the story. She survived cancer, but it was a close-run thing. Three years of going to the GP with stomach spasms and other symptoms failed to pick up what was wrong. Struggling with severe pain, she went to A&E and emergency surgery revealed a tumour and colon cancer. I knew there was something up. I had no idea it was going to be cancer, certainly not that it had been in there for so long. Because I was scared, worried, the whole thing, with the kids, I didn’t know what was going to happen to me. I didn’t know if I would survive it or not. It was just shock. New guidelines have been issued to GPs. The aim is to encourage them to refer more patients for tests or specialist appointments. Early diagnosis raises the chances of successful treatment and ultimately saves lives. Cancer survival rates are not as good as in many other countries. For example, fewer than 80% of patients in the UK and Ireland survive breast cancer for five years or more, whereas it’s more than 86% in France, and for colon cancerjust under 52% survive five years, against more than 62% in Germany. If more patients are going to be referred for scans on equipment like this or other tests, it does raise the question of whether the NHS is able to handle the extra volume of work, which seems likely to follow these new cancer guidelines being introduced. There are fewer scanners per thousand patients in the UK than in several other leading economies and fewer radiologists, and there are warnings the system will be overstretched. It could be very serious. What it could mean is that the people who have got cancers and other serious conditions could face much longer delays. We know already that a lot of patients are waiting for more than a month for results from X-rays and scans. That will take a lot longer if we’re scanning a lot more people. There’s been a widespread welcome for the new focus on early diagnosis, but equally, a call for more investment for testing and treatment to ensure the NHS can raise its game in tackling cancer and doing the best for patients. Hugh Pym, BBC News. A man who beheaded an elderly woman in north London, has been found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. Police have released a video of events leading to the death of 82-year-old Palmira Silva last September. Her killer, Nicholas Salvador, who’s 25 and suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, will be detained indefinitely in a psychiatric hospital. The Old Bailey heard the attack had involved ""extraordinary brutality"". Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder following a house fire that killed three people in Derbyshire. Amy Smith, who was 17, died along with her six-month-old daughter Ruby-Grace Gaunt and Ed Green, also 17, at flats in Langley Mill on Sunday. Police said they are still working to establish the cause of the fire. Stock markets in Europe rose today as a deal between Greece and its creditors to solve the country’s debt crisis seemed on the cards. But in Greece, there’s concern about the government’s proposed new austerity measures, which include changes to pensions and VAT. Pensioners took to the streets in Athens to voice their opposition, as our economics editor, Robert Peston, reports. Greece. No longer drowning. Well, a chance of sailing into calmer waters, if its government builds on yesterday’s progress and reaches a deal later this week with creditors to avoid a devastating default. But the deal requires a host of higher taxes and more from those who can afford these. Here at this magnificent marina, it may be difficult to see Greece as a country in dire financial straits. This place has always had extraordinary numbers of immensely wealthy people. But they’ve been super adept at hiding their income and taking their assets and cash offshore, which is one reason why the government is increasing its luxury tax and including within its scope, for the first time, these beautiful yachts. Dimitris Paraskevas is a top Athens lawyer close to the country’s rich and powerful. One of the problems we have is that our elites have not developed this sense of helping the country and so forth, because the government traditionally in Greece has not been helping people to make money. So these people make money outside Greece, or in some kind of guerrilla war with the government. So the relationship needs to improve. These pensioners clearly aren’t members of the super-rich, but they’re also grumpy with the government. They’re unamused that they may have to pay more for healthcare, even though this blow to their living standards is less than the rest of the Eurozone and the IMF has been demanding. What to make of all this? This owner of a plastic mouldings manufacturer is something of a maverick who never gives up. After all, he skied for Greece, a country with not a great deal of snow, in three Olympics. How worried are you that taxes look as though they are going up on businesses? We worry, as we don’t know if we will survive. You can see that all these taxes made something like 50% of companies stop working. We are afraid, you can understand that. One thing we need is to be stable, to go and know that tomorrow and the next month, what we decided today will be for the next years or months to come. Stability. Blimey. A bit of a balancing act for Greece’s government. In living up to its promise not massively cut pensions or most people’s wages, it’s loading up taxes on the wealthy and companies. But if they stop investing or move abroad, Greece will find it even harder to pay its massive debts. Robert Peston, BBC News, in Athens. The justice Secretary, Michael Gove, has called for urgent reforms to the courts system in England and Wales to make it more efficient, more modern and fairer. In his first speech in the role, Mr Gove said the wealthy currently received a better service, while the whole justice system was ""trapped in antiquated ways of working"". The former chief inspector of schools for England, Sir Chris Woodhead, has died at the age of 68. He’d been suffering from motor neurone disease. Sir Chris was head of Ofsted for six years until the year 2000, and was involved in robust arguments with teaching unions about his methods for trying to raise standards. One former Education Secretary with whom he had disagreements paid distribute. -- this tribute. Chris Woodhead was extremely brave both in dealing with motor neurone disease and in the way in which he conducted himself in the education debate. And although on occasions, we had incredible clashes, I have great respect for the fact that his underlying desire was to raise standards for children in every school in every part of the country. The website Wikileaks has claimed tonight that America’s National Security Agency spied on the current French president, Francois Hollande, and former leaders jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy. The spying is alleged to have taken place between 2006 and 2012. Our North America Editorjon Sopel is in Washington - jon, what more do we know? The document that has been released is called espionage. We have no soul is -- is called espionage. We have no soul is -- source for other than Wikileaks itself, but it is being reported widely in the French media is accurate. As you say, it says that the NSA, the National Security Agency, spied on three successive French presidents over a 10-year period, as well as Cabinet ministers, the French ambassador here in Washington, his conversations were listened into overall subjects ranging from the Greek financial crisis, the global financial crisis, relations between ads financial crisis, relations between ads and Germany, you name it, it all seems to have been covered. Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it surprising? Not really, because we had the disclosures from the whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who disclosed that conversations of Angela Merkel were being listened into as well as those of the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and the Mexican president. We have had no comment yet from the French embassy here in Washington. They are refusing to say anything. One line from the US State Department - One line from the US State Department- we do not comment on the content of leaked documents. The financial stability of Greece will dominate the agenda at the EU summit later this week, but it’s also the meeting at which David Cameron is expected to outline his demands for reforms of the EU ahead of a referendum on Britain’s membership. The prime minister will need to convince his European counterparts that his demands are valid and necessary. Our Europe editor Katya Adler has travelled to three of Europe’s capitals to look at possible EU reform from their perspective. Tonight, she reports from the Polish capital, Warsaw. It’s a slow morning at the local market in Warsaw. An old-fashioned stereotype. Actually, this is the face of Poland in 2015. Proud, dynamic, one of the only EU countries not to suffer a recession during the recent economic crisis. It’s a rising star in Europe, a country David Cameron will have to take seriously in his bid for reform. But Poland is a strong opponent of one of the Prime Minister’s main demands, that other EU workers have fewer benefits than UK employees. That tramples over the right to live and work anywhere in the EU enshrined in the treaties, says Poland. Hundreds of thousands of Poles work in the UK. You can’t discriminate between EU citizens in competition forjobs, just as you can’t discriminate between EU citizens on EU territory in access to health services. Imagine that British people who do retire in France or Spain had differential access to French and Spanish health services. That gives you some idea of what would happen if the boot was on the other foot. Wojciech Amaro is Poland’s answer to Gordon Ramsay, on TV and in his Michelin-starred kitchen, where he concocts new Polish dishes made purely from Polish ingredients. But his sous chefs come from all overthe EU, including the UK. The freedom of movement is crucial in his and other professions, he says. People really treat this seriously as a chance in their lives. The whole idea is having this European community open to anybody. The young and up and coming in Poland are confident and ambitious, a strong contrast to their parents’ generation, which rushed towards the EU as soon as communism ended here. But even these guys can’t change their country’s past or escape its geography. A newly aggressive Russia isjust next door and here, Poland wants help from the EU, Britain included. The UK supports Poland in the call for sustained, tough sanctions against Russia. Russia scares Poland stiff, and therefore, Poland wants to have the rest of the European Union understand the threat and to act together to counter the threat. Poland feels that the UK is on board with this, though, doesn’t it, against Russia? Yes. Poland does not want the United Kingdom to leave, because Poland recognises the value that the United Kingdom brings to the European Union. But standing side by side over Russia will not persuade Poland to limit the benefits of the freedom of movement. Youngsters here and across the EU say it’s an essential of modern European life. It’s already a very hard sell for David Cameron, and negotiations haven’t even started. Katya Adler, BBC News, Warsaw. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have arrived in Germany this evening for a four-day state visit. The German air force escorted the Queen’s plane to Berlin Tegel airport, and a 21-gun salute was fired. During the royals’ visit, they will attend a state banquet, travel to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and hold a private meeting with German Chancellor, Angela Merkel. james Horner, the Hollywood composer who wrote the Oscar-winning score for Titanic, has died in a plane crash in California at the age of 61. He was an experienced pilot and was reported to have been flying the small private plane which crashed near Santa Barbara. It was in 1997 that he won two Oscars for his work on Titanic, but he was also involved in many other successful productions, as David Silitto explains. Sad, romantic, hopeful. And from the first few notes, you know you can only be in one place - the deck of the Titanic. A movie defined by james Horner’s Oscar-winning score. You’re hearing something that is this sort of wistful, slightly melancholy thing, but it’s positive in a way and it’s very pretty. And I think that is dramatically what gets you. Born in Los Angeles, james Horner had studied at London’s Royal College of Music. Ten Oscar nominations, 158 productions. His other great love in life was flying. The wreckage of his Tucano plane was found in California’s Los Padres National Forest. So, what was it that made him special? He had an extraordinarily melodic gift and a way of identifying a film through music so that you could abandon the film. This is why it works so well in concert. You could take the film away and still have the experience. Epic, romantic. The sound of the modern blockbuster. The music ofjames Horner. The composerjames Horner, who’s died at the age of 61.

Eurozone finance ministers have rejected a Greek request to extend their bailout programme beyond next Tuesday, when Athens is due to pay a debt instalment to the IMF of one and a half billion euros.

That is a sad decision for Greece because it has closed the Greece because it has closed the door on further talks where it was door on further talks where it was still open in my mind. In Athens the still open in my mind. In Athens the government had been depending on government had been depending on ﬂexibility as government had been depending on flexibility as it faced serious ﬂexibility as it faced serious funding flexibility as it faced serious funding issues within days. Hanging funding issues within days. Hanging over everything is the fact Greece over everything is the fact Greece has to make a payment of 1.5 billion has to make a payment of 1.5 billion euros to the IMF next Tuesday or euros to the IMF next Tuesday or default. One minister has already default. One minister has already told me Greece won’t pay, but is told me Greece won’t pay, but is looking for the current bailout to looking for the current bailout to be extended at least until the be extended at least until the referendum is over a week on Sunday. referendum is over a week on Sunday. But Eurozone ministers had run out But Eurozone ministers had mn out of patience, But Eurozone ministers had run out of patience, they said no to any of patience, they said no to any bailout extension, leaving Greece bailout extension, leaving Greece facing a default. That refusal will facing a default. That refusal will certainly damage the credibility of certainly damage the credibility of the Eurogroup as a democratic union the Eurogroup as a democratic union of partner member states and I’m of partner member states and I’m very much of partner member states and I’m very much afraid that damage will be very much afraid that damage will be permanent. The Greek government is permanent. The Greek government is seeking reassurance from the seeking reassurance from the European Central Bank it’ll continue European Central Bank it’ll continue funding Greek banks. These are funding Greek banks. These are critical days for Greece. m: We can speak to Gavin in Athens. No We ran speak to Gavin in Athens. No extension We can speak to Gavin in Athens. No extension of the Greek bailout extension of the Greek bailout programme beyond Tuesday, how programme beyond Tuesday, how serious is this for the Athens serious is this for the Athens government? First of all, this is government? First of all, this is the biggest crisis in the history of the biggest crisis in the history of the Eurozone, and a major moment for the Eurozone, and a major moment for Greece. The big question is whether Greece. The big question is whether the European Central Bank will the European Central Bank will continue its emergency funding of continue its emergency funding of Greek banks. If it felt, in the Greek banks. If it felt, in the light of what happened today, it light of what happened today, it couldn’t do that, Greece would have couldn’t do that, Greece would have to consider its own emergency to consider its own emergency measures to try and protect its measures to try and protect its banks. An indication of the banks. An indication of the seriousness of this, Eurozone seriousness of this, Eurozone finance ministers are meeting at the finance ministers are meeting at the minute without a Greek minister minute without a Greek minister being present to discuss how to ring being present to discuss how to ring fence Greece in the event of a fence Greece in the event of a default.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Fifteen Britons are now known to have died in the attack on a tourist resort in Tunisia, and the Foreign office says that number ""may well rise"". Three of the dead have been named as Carly Lovett from Lincolnshire. And from the West Midlands Adrian Evans, and his 22 year old nephewjoel Richards. Survivors have been recalling the horror, as the lone gunman hunted down his victims. There were at least two other females who were dead. Who had been shot. Many British holiday- makers are desperate to get home. So far more than 1,000 have returned to the UK. The other main story this evening: Talks break down between Greece and her creditors, and now it’s feared the country will default on it’s debts next week. Officials say the country’s bailout programme will end on Tuesday. It’s claimed Greeks today moved hundreds of millions of euros out of the country. Good evening. The Government says the assault on a beach resort in Tunisia was ""the most significant attack on British people,"" since the july 7th bombings ten years ago. It’s now confirmed the lone gunman killed at least 15 Britons, but the Foreign Office says that number is likely to rise. In all 38 people were murdered by the lone gunman who had links to Islamic State before being killed himself. Our correspondent Orla Guerin is there, and there are some disturbing scenes in her report. The this was the moment when terror came to the beach. Holiday-makers fleeing a shooting spree. Security forces move in to hunt for the killer who concealed his automatic weapon under a sun umbrella. In the distance, the body lying in the road is said to be his. And here he was in life, Seifeddine Rezgui, a student, reported to have enjoyed break dancing before he was radicalised. Islamic State called him a soldier of the caliphate. His victims are still being formally identified. But some of those slaughtered here have been named locally. Carly Lovett, from Lincolnshire, is believed to be among the dead. She wasjust 24. And sources say Adrian Evans from Sandwell in the West Midlands has been killed, alongside his 22-year-old nephew, joel Richards, a football referee. We have got a bullet hole entry there. But among the survivors, Tony Callaghan from Norfolk. He shows us the bag that took a bullet and saved his wife, Chris. The bullet has actually struck there and deflected down. Deflected into her leg. Both husband and wife are recovering in hospital here, but he is deeply scarred by what he witnessed. I looked down the corridor. There were at least two other females who were dead. They had been shot. And one of the little offices that I went out to on the right, there was a young guy sat in there, and his girlfriend was dead next to him in the office. And he was holding her hand. And I said, what do I do? I said, have you checked for a pulse? I pulled him out of the way, I checked for a pulse and there was no pulse. And he said... We are getting married in two weeks’ time, and she is dead. And from the Prime Minister in London, a warning of more grief to come. Our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of those who were killed or injured in the attack. We are working with the Tunisian authorities to identify a final number of British casualties, but I am afraid the British public need to be prepared for the fact that many of those killed were British. When the shooting started this area was full of British widow makers. -- When the shooting started this area was full of British holiday- makers. Traditionally this area has been popular with families of the UK. It is an area where they felt safe and welcome. But the events on this foreign beach have become a national tragedy for the UK. I just want to know, do you really understand? Because there were several of us in this room that were on that beach when that firing started yesterday and we had to run for our lives. We are trying to help each other. Among British tourists, anger at the company that brought them here which they say has been slow to get them home. We had to tell her it was fireworks. Not gunfire. She is petrified. At the scene today, flowers in memory of the dead who were guilty of nothing except going on holiday. Some came to offer prayers and ask a question for our time, why? In the Orla adult-- ~ "" WE CEI’! -- we can speak to Orla. And there is information about the gunman. Many people have gathered outside the hotel. Some have been bringing flowers. Some have been standing in quiet reflection. Some have been lighting candles. They intend to hold a vigil for the victims. We are learning more about the gunmen who claimed so many lives. The BBC has been to his home in north-western Sousse. We spoke to a relative who was so shocked by the events he could hardly speak. And to an uncle who said there was absolutely no indication, no warning signs, as he put it, that this young man was going to carry out any kind of act of violence like this. He said he was normal, he prayed, the -- he fasted, he went to the mosque. He was seen in the village two or three days ago. Apart from the fact he had shaved his beard he appeared perfectly normal. This was a young man who at one stage was interested in rap music. He had such a passion for break dancing that we are told that he actually competed. Crucially what he was not was on any Government terror watch list. The Prime Minister has admitted he wasn’t brought to the attention of the authorities. They did not know he had any kind of militant connections. There are reports he was radicalised within the past six months by an extremist preacher. It’s so he is in a list of the latest young men in chimneys you who have followed this path. -- young men in Tunisia who have followed his path. Thanks very much. Relatives of many Britons known to have been at the hotel in Sousse are still desperate for news of their loved ones. Some have taken to social media to try and make contact. More than 1,000 British people have returned from the country in the past 24 hours, as our special correspondent Lucy Manning reports. They’ve made it home. But others haven’t yet. And there are growing fears too many Britons won’t. At her home in Doncaster, Carol spent all day desperately trying to contact her mum and stepdad. This afternoon she had heard nothing. It’s my mum. She might be a pain at times, but she is my mum. Ijust want her to come back. I want her to come back with her dramatic stories about how she was there when it happened, and tell me for the next ten years. I just want her to be OK. I’m scared that she is over there and frightened. In the last hour high hopes of good news were realised, she has heard they are safe and well. -- her hopes. One family has already had to face the most terrible news. joel Wicks is and his uncle Adrian Evans, and it’s believed a third relative, killed on the first day of their holiday. -- joel Richards. Loads of people have expressed their condolences to the family. He was well liked. He worked here for a very long time. It is frankly sickening. For other families they are still hoping, but the Daniel Welch every hour of no news brings him close to an outcome he fears. He has heard nothing from his grandfather and partner. Now, at this point today, it is a worst-case scenario. It is very hard to think that we have no information at all. I know that myself and the rest of mY I know that myself and the rest of my immediate family are preparing for the worst news. Ross Naylor in Derby has run his dad again and again, but Scott and his partner are still missing. You fear the worst. You cannot help that. We are just praying hopefully he is somewhere safe. And that he just cannot get in touch. Again, I have been told on social media that it is manic over there. It is chaos. People do not have their IDE. For the ones who have made it back, they know how close they came to the gunman’s bullets. -- their ID. Somebody inside a shouted run. We ran as far away from the bullets as we could. It was all happening so quickly. It was deafening. At the same time I had my dad on the other end of the phone. I was screaming, I love you, I was so scared. Some are flying in, hoping to find the ones who still have not called to say they are safe. Our Home Affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, is at the Foreign Office. just to put this into perspective, the Government say it is the worst attack on British people since the bombings in London a decade ago. It is the deadliest attack on British citizens since the 7th of July British citizens since the 7th of july bombings. This time it has happened overseas, which makes things like putting relatives in touch with the injured in hospital, and identifying the dead, much harder. This is why officials are burning the midnight oil. The Home Secretary will be chairing a third Cobra meeting tomorrow morning. There are detectives on the ground in Tunisia working with the local police, trying to see if there were any conspirators working with this gunman. But also trying to gather evidence. Because there will be in -- there will be in quests. The current hole is estimated at 15. I understand it is likely to rise quite significantly. -- inquests. Several people still have not been found. One person told me that the toll could be closer to two doesn’t. There has been criticism about not being able to get people out who want to leave, is that justified? -- two dozen. Some 2500 have already come home. There is some chaos in trying to organise getting the others home. It is hoped that will improve tomorrow. The Foreign Office is not advising people against travelling to Tunisia. This is because these attacks can happen anywhere as we saw earlier this year in Paris. In the current security environment, dominated as it is by the so-called Islamic State, these attacks can happen in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and even America. Thanks very much. Eurozone finance ministers have rejected a Greek request to extend their bailout programme beyond next Tuesday, when Athens is due to pay a debt instalment to the IMF of EUR1.5 billion. Greece had asked for an extension in order to hold a referendum on the terms of a new bailout deal. Now there’s a real fear there maybe a run on the banks. Our Chief Correspondent, Gavin Hewitt reports from Athens. After a dramatic day with lines outside the banks Greece is facing the prospect of defaulting next Tuesday with unpredictable consequences for the country and the euro zone. It wasn’t a bank run, but there was real anxiety after the Government announced it had rejected the latest bailout offer and would hold a referendum on it. -- government. At this branch people were withdrawing funds, fearing Greece was edging closer to leaving the Euro and perhaps returning to the drachma. It is not good for us, the drachma, it is not good, no, no. At the moment, no. They want to take the money out. But that isn’t the solution. The solution is, this government, go away, right now. The Prime Minister announced he would put the latest bailout offer to a referendum. And told the country he would campaign against it. Eurozone ministers meeting in Brussels turned on the Greek Government, accusing it of unilaterally breaking off the talks. -- Greek government. That is a sad decision for Greece. It has closed the door on further talks where the door was still open in my mind. They had been depending on some flexibility as it faced serious funding issues within days. Greece is to make a payment of 1.5 billion euros to the IMF or it will be in default. A Government minister told me that Greece would not pay. Their plan was to ask for an extension bailout until a referendum week on Sunday. But Eurozone ministers have run out of patients. They said no any ban at extension leaving Greece facing a default. -- patience. That would certainly damage the credibility of the eurogroup as they democratic union. And I am very much afraid that damage would be permanent. The league Eurozone it is turning into the biggest crisis in its history. -- for the Duro zone. The question is will they continue funding Greece’s banks? If not, Greece would have to take emergency steps to protect its banks as early as Monday. -- for the Eurozone. steps to protect its banks as early as Monday. -- forthe Eurozone. Our correspondent is in Brussels where the leaders were meeting. There is still no deal. Is there a real sense we are reaching the end in this crisis? It is not quite the end of the road yet, but it is getting perilously close. The events of the last 24 hours have taken Greece a step closer to a potential exit from the Eurozone. What has happened has been a massive gamble on all sides and potentially costly failure for the single currency, as well. That is why the current days are going to be soaked ultras, particularly in Greece itself. Many people here think Monday should be declared a bank holiday in Greece to prevent further huge cash withdrawals from the system. -- to There are people working away behind-the-scenes, but it is coming down to the wire. Thank you very much. England’s women footballers could make history tonight at the World Cup. Victory in Vancouver against the hosts Canada, would see them reach the semifinals for the very first time. Katie Gornall is there for us. It isjust over It is just over an to go until kick-off. Soon more than 50,000 mostly Canadian fans will be packed out in the stadium here. It will be an intense atmosphere for England’s players. It will be the most high-profile match of their careers. England have already made great strides in this tournament. Now they entered the spiritual home of the Canadian team for a true test of their progress. One Englishman will hope they fail, Canada are led by County Durham born john, will hope they fail, Canada are led by County Durham bornjohn, who is perhaps cut from the same class as George Sampson. We are in a good place to attack, stays strong and positive, to show the resilience we have. And give ourselves the best possible chance of producing a good performance. This team has already shown they can be resilient. They came back from a goal down against Norway to win their first World Cup knockout match. An absolute belter! There are usually few surprises when these sides play each other. The hosts have the edge in their pretournament friendly. But if England feel and any pressure they are not letting it show. And with the final due to be played next week and the players hope it isn’t the last they will see of this city. -- feel under any pressure. Canada’s coach has been turning up the heat. He says his players will give England held. There is no doubt where his allegiances lie, but Sampson’s players know that they will have to come through a physical battle to win here if they are to make history. Thanks very much. That’s it.

It follows chaotic scenes with migrants trying to board UK bound lorries, after the Channel Tunnel was closed due to French industrial action. In talks with the Home Secretary we have been looking at whether we can put more personnel and sniffer dog teams on that side of the channel to make a difference. The other main stories this lunchtime... It’s back to Brussels. Greece’s Prime Minister is summoned for more talks with international creditors to end the debt crisis.

A 13-year-old boy has been arrested after a 1li-year-old was stabbed on his way to school in south east London. A protest about cycling safety - after the eight cycling death on London’s streets this year. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. David Cameron says the Government is considering reinforcing Britain’s border with France around the port of Calais, following what he described as unacceptable scenes of chaos involving migrants trying to reach the UK. There was serious disruption in France yesterday, when hundreds of migrants attempted to climb into lorries backed up at the Channel Tunnel, because of strike action by ferry workers. Services are now returning to normal. Ed Thomas reports now from Calais. Calais is open, and slowly the trucks are rolling in. And that means opportunity for the thousands of migrants who want to escape. Where do you want to get to? And this is how they do it. It is blatant. It is in broad daylight. The lorries and trucks are being opened, and people arejustjumping in. There’s not a police officer around. There is nothing to stop these lorries being opened. And people jumping in. The men, women and children here are risking their lives. The dream is England. Why do you want to go to England? England is better than France. Take this 1li-year-old from Afghanistan. He is here without his parents. just his friends. And his determination. How long have you been trying tojump on the lorries? Every day we are trying. Every day. Will you risk your life? You could die? That’s true. Yes, it’s really true. And then there is Mohammed. Despite his broken cheekbone, he’s still desperate to leave. Is it worth it, risking your life to get to England? Yes. Why? I have to go to the UK because my life is very bad now. There are 3000 migrants here. All looking for a way out on these lorries. For now, it is impossible for the police of Calais to control. It is difficult? A lot of people. And in the middle, the truck drivers and their livelihoods. After yesterday’s ferry strike, some have been stuck here for 24 hours. What do think of all of this? It is incredible to me. Incredible? Yes. It is idiotic! The French government is not going to achieve anything. If the English want to change the law, they will still be coming. We will be in the queues all the time. So who’s responsible? The British are showing they despise the people of Calais. David Cameron’s unilateral decision is a very serious act and a mistake. The UK says it is offering help. But that the French have to police their own borders. We must act on better security at Calais, working with the French. We have already invested £12 million. I am happy to do more if that is necessary. We must work with European partners to stop this problem at source come to break the link with getting on a boat in getting settlement in Europe. We need to do more to make sure Britain is less easy place for illegal migrants to come to and working. That is what our immigration bill is all about. But something here has to give. As the trucks and migrants keep on coming. Daniel Sandford is in Dover for us now. The disruption you saw yesterday, is that over? It is pretty much over so far as the berries are concerned. They have taken full loads across the Channel and everything seemed to be operating well. The problem is, the back-up of the build-up on worries that were left over from yesterday. Still operation Operating Stack on the M25. That is closing a lot-- causing a lot of traffic chaos. Kent Police feels it is in the end of the disruption. By the end of the day they should have things pretty much back to normal. David Cameron has been talking about trying to reinforce the UK border in France at Calle. What can he do on foreign soil? There are multiple things they will be doing. They’re going to be putting in extra security checks at Dover. There is a build-up of migrants in Calais and a higher risk that people will get through the Czechs in Calais. In Calle there already are British border controls. They are trying to catch people on board lorries already. They’ll be putting more forces into that and hope the French police would be putting more resources into policing outside the fence, as it were. They are reinforcing British controls at the Calle end. There is a growing realisation that they will have to focus on the bigger problem. The Defence Secretary and the Prime Minister are talking about making sure the British aid budget is focused at the source countries and making sure those countries become more settled and more normalised so there is less incentive for people to leave those countries. Also concentrating on the smuggling gangs. A 90 person task force being set up by the British governments will have some people based with Europol in Sicily and they will be trying to focus on the smuggling gangs bringing huge numbers of people across the Mediterranean, many of people dash those people have the ultimate destination. -- many of those people. This is high on the agenda at Prime Minister’s Ouestions which was a short time ago. Let’s cross now to our assistant political editor, Norman Smith, who’s in Westminster. It has been stressed that both governments need to work together. The Prime Minister went out of his way to say there would be more British personnel, more sniffer dog teams, more security fences. There may be more money offered to Calais to try to police the situation. A very different mood on the backbenches and the opposition benches, where they are highly critical of the response of the French authorities. There is a widespread view that French authorities are in effect turning a blind eye to migrants coming up through Italy, through France to carry, trying to stow away on ferries to Dover and that the French authorities are allowing that to happen because they do not want those migrants to claim asylum or seek to settle in France. Mr Cameron is under huge pressure to races at tomorrow’s EU summit. One difficulty because the Government has oily said we will not take part in the EU quota scheme to accept migrants from the Mediterranean. -- quota scheme to accept migrants from the Mediterranean. -- has already said. While Prime Minister’s Questions was taking place, they were talking about the planned benefit cuts. Today we have been stopped from filming because of the chaotic scenes which I have never seen before in my many years covering Parliament. Around 20 or so protesters, many in wheelchairs, sought to storm the Commons chamber while PMQs was under way. They were talking that cuts to the Independent living fund. They wear perfectly reasonable. Halfway through, a huge cheer went up and they rushed towards the door leading into the members lobby and the authorities are onlyjust able to stop them from getting into the Commons Chamber right in the middle of Prime Minister’s Questions. Apologies to our viewers for some of the break-up in pictures. Greece’s Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, is returning to Brussels for another meeting with creditors, to end his country’s debt crisis. There are reports a deal is still a long way off, with little progress being made in talks yesterday. Chris Morris is in Brussels for us. Could a deal be in the offing? It has not cut spending, it has raised taxes. He has been criticised for refusing to accept the group part of the deal that this has never happened before when countries like Ireland and Portugal were renegotiating bailouts they were given that kind of leeway. Still hopeful of a deal but critical of people sitting on the other side of the table. One assumes the pressure back home in Greece not to back down must be building on him. This is his big dilemma. He is under pressure from people within his own party who have said you have given up too much already are now the creditors seem to be saying you have still got to give up a little bit more. On his official Twitter feed, give up a little bit more. On his officialTwitterfeed, he give up a little bit more. On his official Twitterfeed, he said it seemed to him that perhaps the creditors either do not want a deal or they are playing into the hands of special interests in Greece. What he means by that if there is a fear within his own party that there are those in the Eurozone who are determined to put him under such pressure that, in the end of his government will fall apart. The US ambassador in Paris has been summoned widely French government after spying accusations. Documents published by the website WikiLeaks, claim the monitoring took place over a ten-year period. Our Security Correspondent Gordon Correra is here. Corera is with me. It has been described as unacceptable, the idea this was taking place, spying on three French presidents. The Ambassador of the United States has been summoned in Paris. There are also plans for a French official to visit Washington. Clear signs that the French are unhappy about this, the US is embarrassed by this, being caught. Beneath the surface both countries now this kind of spying goes on. French diplomats have known and suspected this might have happened. One of the first rules of espionage is, do not get caught. There have been documents exposing what they were up to. There was no great secrets in the documents we have seen so far, just a few slightly embarrassed in Revelations. Still, for the United States, it is awkward. For Paris, they have to show they are unhappy that it has happened, even though it was expected. I think it is likely to blow over relatively quickly. We saw a more serious dispute really be Germany, when it was revealed that Angela Merkel, the Chancellor’s ceuphone Angela Merkel, the Chancellor’s cellphone was being monitored by the USA. The Germans are more sensitive by allegations of espionage. The scars with East Germany have made them more sensitive. The French have been slightly more laid back by espionage. They say they are upset. Whether it turns into a longer lasting diplomatic row, I think that is less likely. Many thanks. A new investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham has identified around 300 possible suspects, according to the National Crime Agency, describing the extent of abuse in the town as ""horrendous."" Last year’s jay Report estimated that there were 1400 child abuse victims in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. Danny Savage is in our Sheffield newsroom for us. Danny, more disturbing revelations coming out of this latest report. For the first time we have an estimate on the number of people who are believed to be offenders in the enquiry. This investigation have his -- has been going on for six months. Investigations have been going on since last summer. There are 300 people they have identified as being people who they think that these those young girls local to Rotherham who were aged between 12 and 16 over a 16, 17 year who were aged between 12 and 16 over a16, 17 year period. The abuse is described as horrendous and the offence as very disturbing. They say no 1 should rest easy because of the passage of time. Some of the offences took place 18 years ago. People will be brought to justice. They are entering the next phase now, arresting people and identifying people in more detail, getting enough evidence to carry out arrests. In three years time potentially they will still be processing people through the courts. This enquiry will be getting much bigger before it concludes. Our top story this lunchtime. The Prime Minister says he’s considering reinforcing Britain’s border with France at Calais. And still to come, Sir Ben Ainslie hoping to make history in the Americas Cup. Later on BBC London. From GP to actress - six Londoners are plucked from obscurity to join the Royal Shakespeare Company on stage. And Princess Ann gives the royal seal of approval to the Surrey Woodlands dedicated to the memory of those who died in the First World War. The Queen is on the second day of her State visit to Germany, where she’s been meeting President and the Chancellor Angela Merkel. The trip coincides with the annual report into royal finances. Politicians in London and Edinburgh have both denied suggestions Scotland is going to pay less towards the Queen’s upkeep. Our Royal Correspondent Nicholas Witchell is in Berlin. This is the fifth state visit that the Queen is paying to Germany, a country which is now vital European partner. And the German public seem genuinely intrigued by this visit from the Queen. She is probably the most respected head of state in the wilds. In her 90th year now still representing the United Kingdom to the wider world. Much of which regards her with fascination. This was Berlin this morning. The ceremonial welcome at the start of a state visit to Germany visit such as this are largely symbolic, an expression of the highest level of friendship between nations. With among other things, an exchange of gifts. The German president presented the Queen with a painting of her as a child on horseback. All donein of her as a child on horseback. All done in the service of the UK. So how much exactly does it cost the country to have a monarchy? Kim Pallas hasjust published its annual report on royal finances. The Sovereign Grand Master 2016 to 2017 will be A2 million pounds. A figure which does not include the cost of security. The Pallas says it needs increased funding to meet the costs of an action programme of renovation at the Palace. An initial estimate of the cost is £150 million. One option being considered is for the Queen and herfamily option being considered is for the Queen and her family to move out of Buckingham Palace while the work is being done. But no decisions have yet been taken. Headlines this morning cast doubt on whether an increasingly devolved Scottish Government will continue to fund the monarchy at the same level as present. The senior Palace official suggested it will not. But the Treasury in London and the Scottish Government insists that it will. Scotland will pay full contribution to the sovereign. There is no intention to cut our contribution, there is no desire to cut your contribution and there has never been any discussion about cutting our contribution. Backin our contribution. Back in Berlin the Queen has been doing what she knows best. Fulfilling the duties of the head of state, steering clear politics of course, but playing a part as perhaps only she can in relations with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It will not be lost on anyone that the UK is currently looking for German support in its efforts to re-negotiate its future in the European Union. And the Prime Minister will be hoping to seize the moment, coming out later this afternoon to have talks with Angela Merkel. He will be joining the state banquet in honour of the Queen tonight. A former police officer on trial for the murder of a 2lI-year-old man in north London ten years ago has begun his defence. Anthony Long - a firearms officer- is accused of firing eight shots at a car carrying suspected armed robbers. One of the passengers, Azelle Rodney, was killed. Anthony Long denies the charge. june Kelly is outside the Old Bailey in central London. Well Anthony Long fired eight bullets at Azelle Rodney. Six hit him in the head and body and today dashed today the mother of Azelle Rodney and other family members were in court as this former officer began his defence. He described how police intelligence was that Azelle Rodney was a member of an armed criminal gang. And Anthony Long was unarmed police convoy which boxed in the car. And it was from his position in that car that he opened fire. He told the jury, position in that car that he opened fire. He told thejury, I saw him look to his left and right and then he ducks down. He then sprang up. He said his whole language indicated to me that he was about to fire a weapon. I could not see it but I was convinced that he had picked up a gun. And he said that he fired because he wanted to protect his colleagues. He said he fired several times because he could see no indication that his earlier shots had any effect on Azelle Rodney. This officer will continue his evidence this afternoon. The sister of a woman with Downs Syndrome who died in hospital, has gone to the High Court, to overturn a coroner’s decision not to allow a full inquest into her death. Maria Ferreira died at Kings College Hospital in London two years ago, and now her sister Luisa wants the families of people who lack mental capacity and who die in hospital, to be legally granted a fulljury inquest. That currently doesn’t always happen. Our legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman reports. Louisa and her sister attempt were inseparable. Louisa was her carer and best friend. She was the most amazing last night ever met. She always said she was content with her life. She was assertive and strong willed. She knew what she wanted. And she was very adventurous. In late 2013, Maria col who was prone to chest infections, fell ill. It was at this hospital that Maria Ferreira, a woman who could not speak and had severe learning disabilities and was partially deaf and blind, spent two and a half weeks. But her sister continuously by her side. On the 6th of December Louisa went home to get fresh clothes, asking staff to prevent Maria from removing oxygen tubes. Maria died the following afternoon having pulled out the ventilator tubes. A senior coroner ruled that Maria was not being compulsorily detained in hospital and so they would not be an inquest with the jury. Today Louisa is challenging that decision at the High Court, arguing that her sister lacked mental capacity and so was being detained. If this case clarifies and changes the law to the point that clear guidelines are set and improvements in care, I will be hÂppvÂ improvements in care, I will be happy. And it will be an ugly legacy for Maria. Campaigners believe the case could affect thousands of patients. People suffering from dementia or learning disabilities for example, where they die and where there are concerns about their treatment and care, we need an inquest system that is robust enough to identify systemic failings in order to safeguard lives in the future. This was the last date with her. But for Louisa the pain of losing Maria is intense and ongoing. It was thought they reached their top speed in 1950,but now it seems race horses are galloping faster after all. A new study published in the Royal Societyjournal has looked at winning times over the last 165 years. As our Science Correspondent Pallab Ghosh explains the findings are a bit of shock for many in the racing industry. The thrill of the races is no one knows for sure who is going to win. But how much is horse racing changing over the years. This was a different era. In 1950 it was thought that speeds had peaked. But a new and more detailed analysis published by the Royal Society of race times from all the top races, run in the past 165 years, tells a different story. Essentially we discovered that race horses are getting faster but also we found out that the improvement is largely driven by improvements in sprinters. So over longer distances especially at elite level, resources do not seem be improving. Many thoroughbred horses are bred at the National Stud in Newmarket. One of the big questions is why horses have not got faster over longer distances. One possibility is that the industry has bred for speed rather than stamina. If that is the case then with a slight change in approach, it might be possible to produce horses that are faster over longer distances as well. That could alter the odds at race meetings. But punters currently look at conditions as well as a form. Some experts do not think much will change. Since the 1970s and early 1980s, when the thoroughbred game became commercialised, everyone is pleading for speed. They want horses to run at two and not four. They want instant success. In a sport where fractions of a second count, sprinters they continued to get faster but improvements in longer distance runners will be too close to call. The four-time Olympic gold-medal winning sailor, Sir Ben Ainslie, is now hoping to lead a British team to victory in the America’s Cup for the first time in its 160 year history. Today he officially opened new headquarters in Portsmouth and Duncan Kennedy has been given exclusive access. This is the brand-new headquarters for the America’s Cup challenge by the UK. It is the oldest international sporting trophy in the world and the UK have never won it. Now Sir Ben Ainslie is hoping to change all that. The Solent has never seen anything like it. The flying boat of Ben Ainslie. Soaring and skimming, this is a life on top of the ocean waves. And the first time in 164 years, Americas Cup has come to British waters. This phenomenal vessel rides high on carbon fibre foils. just listen to the sound of speed. WHOOSHING. It’s skippered by Ben Ainslie, Britain’s Olympic gold medallist, who last time helped the Americans win. But not any more. These AC45s can travel at around 50 knots out here on the open sea. Even though they weigh more than a tonne. No wonder they’re called the Formula One of ocean racing. The idea is to be up out of the water, foiling along to minimise the drag. Which is why they’re more like a plane than a boat. Can Britain win the America’s Cup? Yeah, Britain can win the America’s Cup. We need to win it, we’ve never won it in 164 years. It’s going to be an incredibly tough challenge, but believe me, we would not be doing this if we didn’t think we could win it. And Emmett crosses the line with the American yacht slightly ahead. He is right. Not since it began on the Solent in 1851 has Britain won it. The crew are on their toes all the time, working with the will that makes for success. But now, with this brand-new headquarters in the heart of Portsmouth harbour, and his brand-new team around him, Sir Ben believes he can slice through all competition. And bring the oldest international trophy in world sport back home. Well to win the America’s Cup love got to beat America, the current holders. That means eating a lot more challengers. It begins here off the coast of South Sea next month, the first time in 164 years but America’s Cup racing will be back in the UK. -- that. Time for a look at the weather. Here’s Helen Willetts. ~ Ibegin in I begin in America. We do have some sunshine but in the next few days we have some tropical origin to the air. This is the remnants of tropical depression which gave a lot of rain across the United States. It has now been swept up by the jet stream. Pushing it across the Atlantic. You can still see on the satellite picture that it has some identity out there in the Atlantic and it is heading our way. It is going to become more humid. But there will be some sunshine and rain as well. For all of us some rain on Friday. Now the rain will help with the pollen levels because today they are very high. A little lower across Scotland and Northern Ireland because of this weather front. Some sunshine for the Northern Isles and brightening up for Northern Ireland and the South of Scotland. But some heavy showers around this afternoon. For England and Wales it is a largely dry picture. Plenty of warm sunshine and temperatures are ready into the low 20s. That means a fine start for the Glastonbury Festival. There is a chance of rain at the time we get to Friday. In the meantime the rain continues this evening in the North. An overnight the main change is the increase in moisture. This is the start of the rain from that tropical depression. So a little bit foggy for some of the coasts first ring. Otherwise England and Wales, largely fine and dry. -- England and Wales, largely fine and dry. -- first thing. Even with the rain it will be quite warm because of the increasing humidity. Similar temperatures elsewhere, but feeling quite muddy. So the South Westerly winds ahead of the weather system, they then begin to push in on Thursday night and into Friday and we will all see some rain. Heaviest in the North but for all of us quite ugly feeling. And then behind that it starts to feel pressure. -- ugly feeling. And then behind that it starts to feel pressure. -- quite muddy peeling. Saturday begins fine and dry. And then more rain on Sunday. But feeling quite humid in the next couple of days. Now a reminder of our top story this lunchtime. The Prime Minister says he is considering reinforcing the UK borders with France at Calais. That’s all from us, now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Have a good afternoon. Good afternoon and welcome to BBC London news. I’m Louisa Preston. A 13-year-old boy has been arrested after a 14-year-old was stabbed on his way to school in south east London. Police were called to Deptford Green School in New Cross where they found a boy with a wound to his thigh. Anjana Gadgil is there for us now. Well the school told us this morning a 14-year-old boy turned up with stab wounds to his thigh. They called emergency services and the boy was taken to hospital. He is still there now. A 13-year-old boy was then arrested on suspicion of causing GBH. Although the school and police said the stabbing did not take place on school premises and the boy was not a pupil at the school. Lewisham police have released a photograph of the weapon. It is a large knife with a blue handle. Add a picture of a spider. They said the boy was lucky as the incident could have been much worse. Police forensic teams are still looking up the knife. The Met commissioner told BBC London there has been an increase in knife crime. He wants to see a rise in the number of stop and searches carried out on the streets of London. He said if we get into the stage where people think they can carry knives with impunity, that cannot be good for anyone. ",,

Police in Calais find 350 migrants hiding in cars and lorries bound for the UK in just four hours this morning. The Prime Minister says the Government is ready to do more to help strengthen security there. We have been looking at whether we can put more personnel and sniffer dog teams on that side of the Channel to make a difference. We’ve the latest tonight from both sides of the Channel. The Greek Prime Minister meets European leaders to try to resolve the country’s debt crisis - a deal still appears some way off. Mo Farah’s trainer Alberto Salazar breaks his silence to make a detailed rebuttal of doping allegations. Homelessness among children in England on the rise - over 90,000 are without a proper home. And... Tonight on BBC London: The massive repair bill for Buckingham Palace, and why the Queen might have to move out. And hundreds of cyclists call for safer roads, after the eighth death so far this year. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. Police in Calais have revealed they found 350 migrants stowed away in lorries and cars bound for the UK within a four hour period this morning. David Cameron has described the scenes at Calais, where hundreds of migrants tried to board vehicles delayed by a strike as ""totally unacceptable"". He said he’s looking at increasing security around Calais with the UK contributing more border staff and sniffer dogs. Our correspondent Lucy Williamson is in Calais. What’s the latest there? There is still a bit of a problem but there have been more police and more border checks. The result, hundreds of migrants found hiding in vehicles by breakfast time. This is the new normal in Calais. If this situation has taught us anything it is that simply catching migrants is not a long-term solution. For Calais, this is now what normal looks like. 350 migrants were found inside vehicles in the first few hours this morning. Some drivers are simply leaving any checks for the police. The traffic entering the Channel Tunnel was moving this afternoon but still they sat, waiting to see if Wednesday would be their lucky day. Among them was this man, 24 years old, he made it to the second border check yesterday, a small setback for someone who has drained of England for years. It is a dream to come here. To know how life goes on. I am in need of knowledge. Yesterday’s Isis is giving way to Calais normal routine. Some routine. The sheer numbers of migrants have changed the game ahead of the Port authority and the old gentleman’s that used to govern behaviour has gone out of the window. One British truck driver described it as chaos. He has been doing this crossing for 24 years but says he will stop if numbers grow any more. It is getting dangerous. It is getting out of hand. It does not matter, I called the police and they would ignore it. There are too many of us. That is their force, their strength. many of us. That is their force, theirstrength. Despite their strength. Despite £50 million of British investment in security, locals know who they blame for the problem. England is to blame, they have at the beginning but now they are getting cold feet. Why should we have to pay and get all the migrants. Tomorrow, a plan to divide European migrants between member states will be discussed at a summit meeting in Brussels. Calais migrants are, little by little, becoming everyone’s on. The pressure on Europe’s border is growing as migrants try to reach the continent in search of a better life. They come predominantly from Africa and the Middle East and the usual route is across the Mediterranean - thousands have died in the attempt. More than 100,000 have made across the Mediterranean Sea to Europe in the first six months of this year. Many of those who want to reach the UK head for Calais. 3,000 migrants are camped in squalid conditions outside the town waiting their chance to stow away on a lorry to get across the Channel and, of course, some succeed. Daniel Sandford reports. Walking through a field in broad daylight, migrants who have climbed out of a lorryjust north of London on the M1. The truck had come through Dover last night after the day of chaos in Calais. The name, including Abdul Aziz, relieved that the long journey was at an end. Going to England is cool. Seven migrants were taken away by police but are likely to obtain asylum in their successful obtain on their countries of origin. In Dover, the port was running as normal, working through the backlog caused by yesterday’s right foot of it is more than a decade since the security and immigration checks here at Dover were moved across the Channel to Calais. The surge in migrants this summer has forced ministers to review the arrangement. The Prime Minister has said the scenes of chaos in Calais yesterday were totally unacceptable. We have been looking at whether we can put more personnel and sniffer dog teams on that side of the Channel to make a difference and there is also more work being done in terms of installing fencing, notjust around the port at Calais, but also around the Eurostar and Eurotunnel entrance. Labour is claiming the Government took its eye off the ball. We need more border staff. We put forward proposals for more. We also need much stronger pressure on the French government. There needs to be more accessible to people who are arriving who might be illegal immigrants. It is the hundreds of thousands of migrants crossing the Mediterranean that is part of the Calais chaos. The Government is saying today wants to deal with the problem at source, by tackling the smuggling gangs and targeting overseas aid at countries where migrants come from. So people will have more incentive to stay where they are rather than coming to Britain. Ahead of an EU summit in Brussels tomorrow, David Cameron has been meeting the German Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks in Berlin. On the agenda, the issue of migrants and how to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with the EU. The meeting took place as the Queen and Prince Philip began a state visit to the German capital, from where our deputy political editor james Landale reports from Berlin. This is the welcome that Berlin gave today to the Queen. Germany may have mnemonic itself -- today to the Queen. Germany may have mnemonic itself -- no monarchy itself. This, the clean-up is fit state visit was not just about boat trips and ceremonies can it was a chance to strengthen Britain’s relationship with a country that could strengthen our future in the European Union. Something to be discussed with the most powerful woman in Europe. After Britain’s Barford in Chief prepared the way, her chief minister arrived to make his own way to reform the EU with Chancellor Merkel. It was threatened by the immigration crisis. David Cameron was warned not to rely too much on Germany flying the flag for Britain in Europe. We are an important partner in Europe. There are also other partners. This European Union is a European Union with 28 member states. Each country has one route. What is Mr Cameron hoping for? He wants national parliaments to have greater powers to club together and block EU laws. At the moment they can only ask for a rethink. You will so greater protection against decisions taken by Germany and other Eurozone countries which could damage the city of London and other financial centres outside of Europe. He wants to deter EU migrants from coming to Britain by cutting benefits they can claim and sent home. And he wants an opt out from the EU’s that to ever closer union, to protect Britain while other countries, like Germany, want to integrate further. Mr Cameron does not want to show his negotiating hand to early or be accused by MPs of lacking ambition. There is room for change not only in the UK but also in Germany. We perceive the European economies are competing worldwide. They are losing market share is. We need to have some new, fresh start for the European project. In Berlin, not all are so optimistic. The idea of Europe is very grave. Ido not like the English to get all the advantages of the European Union and when it comes to sharing and to the burden of disadvantages that everyone has two share, the English say no. Tomorrow in Brussels, the talk will all be of migration and Greece. Over dinner, Mr Cameron will finally get to chance to talk to all the usually do is about his plans. Today the Queen paid her respects to the war dead in Germany, recalling a time when Europe was anything but a union. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, is back in Brussels today for more talks, trying to agree a deal with the country’s main creditors that will stop Greece from effectively going bust by the end of the month. Despite hopes earlier this week that an agreement is close, the word from Brussels is there is still a lot of work to be done. Damian Grammaticas is in Brussels for us, Damian, both sides seem to be talking about obstacles in the way of a deal? Yes, they are. The Greek Prime Minister has been locked in talks this afternoon with his creditors, finance ministers from the 19 I use the euro have just been arriving for their meetings. They are saying there is hard work to do. The optimism because of the Greek plan which the other countries said was something to work with, they have been through it and it is full of red lines, it is like a piece of poor homework and they have asked for allsorts of changes that Greece needs to make to tax collection. They are relying too much on increase in taxes. It needs to cut benefits for pensioners and tax breaks for people who live on the islands, for the farmers. Hard negotiating still to come. The Greek Prime Minister is very angry about this. He said his country is being treated worse than nations like Ireland and Portugal had been but there are only six days left until the end of the month, until he had to pay his bills to the IMF and if he does not and defaults, there could be unpredictable consequences. A group of people protesting against changes to disability benefits attempted to enter the chamber of the House of Commons during Prime Minister’s Questions. About 30 campaigners - some in wheelchairs - tried to force their way past officials and police, but the doors were shut before they got through. They say people will lose out when local councils take over responsibility for the Independent Living Fund, which helps those with severe disabilities. A mother, who went on the run with her three-year-old son, has had legal proceedings against her dropped by the child’s father. Rebecca Minnock disappeared from her home in Somerset with her son Ethan at the end of May, after a judge ruled he should live with his dad. Roger Williams said he dropped the case, because it was in his son’s best interests. A nationally acclaimed head teacher has been jailed for eight years for having sex with two underage boys. Anne Lakey, who comes from Stanley in County Durham, was convicted on 13 counts of indecent assault on the teenagers in the 1980s. Prosecutors said the 55-year-old, who’d denied committing the offences over a three-year period, was a sexual predator. In the last half hour, Mo Farah’s trainer, Alberto Salazar, has broken his silence to make his first detailed rebuttal of doping allegations raised in a BBC Panorama programme. In an open letter, he has protested his innocence saying, he has never permitted doping and never will. There’s no suggestion Mo Farah has done anything wrong. Let’s talk to our sport editor, Dan Roan. It is a very long and detailed letter. fill us in on what he’s said. The world of athletics has been waiting with baited breath to see exactly how Salazar would respond to those allegations aired in a BBC documentary three weeks ago tonight that both he and his runner, Galen Rupp. that both he and his runner, Galen Rupp, violated doping regulations. There was no suggestion that Mo Farah was guilty of any wrongdoing and both Salazar and Galen Rupp issued strong denials in written statements. Salazar has said he would issue in due course a more detailed rebuttal. He said his accusers had knowingly made full statement is. This evening it became clear exactly why it has taken him three weeks to make that defence. This is the 12,000 word open letter he has published this evening. He has said he believes in a clean sport and would never permit doping. He goes through each and every one of the allegations he is responding to in a clean sport and would never permit doping. He goes through each and every one of the allegations he is responding to at worst, lying. We’re waiting to see whether or not this will prove enough to the sport of athletics that the governing body in this country who knew Salop start as an adviser-- Salazar as an adviser and four Mo Farah before deciding on his future relationship with the coach. Our top story this evening: police in Calais find 350 migrants hiding in vehicles bound for the UK in just four hours this morning. And still to come, Nicolas Hamilton on his fight to succeed in motorsport. Later on BBC London: Fighting for an inquest. The sister of a young woman with Down Syndrome takes her case to the High Court. And the GP who’s stepping away from the surgery to take centre stage with the Royal Shakespeare Company. with burial charges soaring in some areas. Homelessness in England among families and children is on the rise, according to the latest figures. The government says 64,000 households are currently classed as homeless and living in temporary accommodation. That’s up over a quarter since 2010. It means that in England, more than 93,000 children are homeless. Here’s our Home Editor Mark Easton. Deserted by her husband and unable to work because of clinical depression. A middle-class American-born woman finds herself and her family officially homeless. After more than two months in bed and breakfast, now in emergency accommodation - one of 65,000 households in the country currently on the homeless register. I saw my relatively happy, healthy children declining, falling off a cliff and I couldn’t do anything about it. What got me the most was I was trying to have to be brave so they would look and not be scared but I was incredibly frightened. I’m still not feeling better about that. This is the bed and breakfast where Felicia and her two children lived in one room for ten weeks. Figures today show that the number of similar families in England forced into bed and breakfasts is now at its highest level for 12 years. Homelessness is on the rise. This is the tragic consequence of a broken housing system. A terrible perfect storm of welfare cuts, lack of affordable housing and cuts to councils means that we are seeing a massive increase in the numbers of family stuck in short-term accommodation and homelessness. The government says it is ensuring homeless people get the help they need and is encouraging people off welfare and into work. But official figures tomorrow are expected to show a sharp rise in child poverty as cuts to benefits hit low income households. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour suggested further welfare cuts would harm many more children. Cutting 5 billion pounds from tax credits would mean working families losing on average £1l+00 per year. I know he doesn’t have to budget but many families do. That’s the truth. Let’s have an economy with higher pay, lower taxes and lower welfare. What she seems to want is the current failure of low pay, high tax and high welfare. That what is what we need to move on from. Felicia’s meticulous book-keeping is her attempt to make ends meet. The government think the current definition of poverty, based on income solely is too narrow and would like a new measure. Critics argue that arguments about the measurement of poverty will distract from tackling its causes. Around 300 potential suspects have been identified in an investigation into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. The National Crime Agency has described the extent of abuse in the town as ""horrendous."" It follows a report last year that concluded 1400 children had been sexually abused between 1997 and 2013. Our correspondent Danny Savage is in Rotherham tonight. It is getting on for a year since the enquiry came out. There have only been a handful of arrests, which seems out of proportion to the number of victims. The police have been ringing as of two speed with where they are. The new announcement today says that there are 300 suspects who they believe are responsible for the abuse over a 16 year period. Their message is that just because there is a big passage of time, it doesn’t mean that the people responsible won’t be brought to justice. people responsible won’t be brought tojustice. We are going to hear a lot more about this operation over the coming years. He’s the younger brother of the current Formula One world champion, but Nicolas Hamilton is determined to forge his own success in the world of motorsport. The 23-year-old has cerebral palsy and is about to become the first disabled driver to compete in the British Touring Car Championships. He took Nikki Fox for a spin around the track at Goodwood. I have cerebral palsy, so my condition isn’t really built for this kind of sport. It’s not built for doing 100-150 miles an hour. Nick Hamilton is preparing for the British touring car championship. He’s only been racing for three years but he has been around the sport all his life. Brother of Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, Nick has had to work extra hard to get to this point. I was in a wheelchair for three or four years. You start to see that life is real tough. As a toddler with CP, it’s always difficult to understand your condition. You don’t understand why it is so hard to walk. I class myself as one of the lucky ones. You know, I’m able to do everything I actually want to do if I push myself to the limit. Minimal modifications to his car unable Nick to compete at the top level. And he’s quick. Ready! Watching your brother, growing up. Did you admire him? I looked up to Lewis, like you wouldn’t believe. Being a Hamilton, a lot of people think that I’ve got a lot of backing from the family. But, for me, Ido it all on my own. I have my own manager, my own team that are looking after me, getting my sponsors. For me, it’s all about working for what you want. I’ve always had one wish, to spend one day able-bodied, just to see what it’s like. Then come back to where I am. By becoming the first disabled driver to reach this level, Nick hopes that his motivation to race will pave the way for more people to get involved in motor sport, no matter what their disability. Nikki Fox, BBC News. The Indian Ocean island of Madagascar is home to some of the world’s rarest species, including the Ploughshare tortoise. Hunted by gangs of Asian smugglers, there are nowjust a few hundred of the tortoises left. In a bid to save them, conservationists have taken the controversial step of defacing their shells. Our Science Editor David Shukman reports from Madagascar. On the brink of extinction, one of the most valuable animals on the planet. It is the ploughshare tortoise. The intricate and beautiful patterns of their shells make them highly sought after on the black market and they are down to the last few hundred. With a distinctive piece of shell jutting forward, these creatures are in hot demand as pets. In China and south-east Asia adults can fetch about £24,000. So the charity trying to care for them is taking an extreme and controversial step. Engraving right across the shell. Deliberately spoiling the looks of the animals. We watch the process. The tortoises don’t like it but they don’t seem to be hurt. Desperate times require desperate measures. There’s no way around that. What we are doing is facing one of the most beautiful animals on the planet. Our whole being, we hate doing it. There’s no question about it. It goes against every fibre of our bodies. A new generation of ploughshare tortoises. Tiny and vulnerable. For nearly 30 years this breeding project has tried to boost the dwindling numbers. The poachers are circling all the time. Two years ago, a suitcase at Bangkok airport was found with 54 babies wrapped in cling film, many of them dead. Animals with a price tag of tens of thousands of pounds so the police have to keep watch around the clock. There have been thefts. Most recently two smugglers from Taiwan tried to bribe their way in. The problem is that so many of these tortoises don’t even reach this stage in life. Those that do then take 20 years to reach the maturity needed to reproduce. It’s a very slow life cycle. The poachers can just wreck it at a stroke. As long as the black market price remains high for these animals, extinction remains a real possibility. To see the front line of the battle to keep the tortoises alive we travelled to one of the remotest corners of Madagascar. Local people are hired to watch over the animals and they use radio to keep track of them in the forest. Hidden away in a thicket of bamboo, an adult tortoise. Fitted with a tracking device. 100 animals bred in captivity have been added to the population in the wild but numbers are still falling. With all these threats, it’s kind of difficult to hope that they will survive. With all of our plans, they might survive. But now, there’s a new concern. This area is rich in iron ore. A Chinese company has plans to open a huge mine nearby. Good forjobs, bad for wildlife. In the one place where these tortoises live in the wild, there is another threat. A road could slice right through here to a massive new port. It raises a difficult question for Madagascar. It’s an incredibly poor country but also home to creatures that live nowhere else on earth. These animals have existed here for tens of millions of years and they have coped with every danger thrown at them until now. The initials of Madagascar are carved into their shells. That may help to protect them. But this is a creature on the very edge of survival. David Shukman, BBC News in Madagascar. Time for a look at the weather. Good evening. I thought we would start in Pakistan where there has been a sweltering heat wave. In Karachi we saw signs of temperatures as high as 37 degrees. A real contrast here. Temperatures as low as 10 degrees in Scotland. A feature overnight will be low cloud in the West of England and Wales. Quite a 9""âY West of England and Wales. Quite a grey start but quite mild. 13-14 -15 degrees. We have got some rain on the way for tomorrow and some more for Friday. Western parts of England and Wales might see an odd spot of rain but many places dry. The best of the sunshine into the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east. The rain will keep the pollen levels at a moderate level. I suspect the levels will be dropping towards the end of the week as more persistent rain sweeps its way in. Heavier further west. Some implications for Glastonbury. First part of the weekend looks pretty for most of us. If you are out and about, you can stay ahead of the weather with the BBC weather app. ~ I think the Royal family are great tourist attraction. I think it’s an investment in future revenue coming into the country. Why is it up to us? With the stated everything else is in the moments, I just think it’s actually ridiculous. Does living near a noisy road increased chance of dying from heart problems? And is travelling back to World War I. And is travelling back to World War I, and a unique way to remember those who died. Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Alex Bushill. They are London’s most famous residents but the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh may need to move out of Buckingham Palace because it’s in major need of repair. The roof needs fixing and the building needs urgent rewiring. It’s thought the refit will cost £150 million and the taxpayer will have to foot the bill. It comes as the annual finances of the palace are published and show the value of the queen’s estate has increased in value. Ayshea Buksh has the story. Today we got the chance to look at the Royal Family’s finances. How much they’re spending and how much will need to spend. One of the biggest expenditures is likely to be on Buckingham Palace, one of the most famous London tourist attractions and in urgent need of repair. They’re one of the richest families in the world and live in luxurious mansions. Their most famous resident in the heart of London is Buckingham Palace. -- heart of London is Buckingham Palace. -- most famous residents. It hasn’t been redecorated since the 50s. The repair work could be so extensive, Majesty Magazine to move out. It’s a mammoth task. Bits of the building keep falling off. The wires haven’t been changed in 60 years which means that energy costs are soaring. It hasn’t had a rewiring or plumbing job done to it in over 60 years. The Palace has 775 rooms, including 78 bathrooms. Otherjobs in the property include further removal of asbestos, as these pictures show, a job started last year. While the Queen makes a state visit to Germany, manual accounts have been made public. According to the palace, the work will cost £150 million. The taxpayer will be footing the bill. There has been a history of failure to keep up with repairs. The Palace does belong to us in the first place so they are asking us to pay for the building. Let us open it up all year round and bring in the tourists. As with the Tower of London, it will PGY with the Tower of London, it will pay for itself. It may seem cheap compared to Westminster, which also needs major renovation. That could cost over £3 billion. Meanwhile, the value of the Queen’s property portfolio, the Crown estate, is now worth £11.5 billion and has this year returns records profits. So does maintenance work on Buckingham Palace represent real value for money? I think the Royal Family a big tourist attraction and it’s an investment revenue coming into the country. Why is it down to us? With the stated everything else is in the moment, Ijust think it’s actually quite disgusting. Everyone PBYS actually quite disgusting. Everyone pays their taxes. If that’s the way it has to be, that’s the way has to be. Whether you believe Buckingham Palace is a national asset or overpriced home, the Royal family must continue to balance their books. What have the palace said about where the Queen may go? We co nta cted We contacted the Palace for a statement may have told us that they insisted that this is pure speculation. The Queen may need to ",,

Police said 350 people were removed from cars and lorries in the space ofjust four hours today as drivers suffered more delays.

And does living near a noisy road increase your chance of dying from heart problems? Good evening. Hundreds of migrants have gathered again today on roads around Calais, trying to clamber on to moving vehicles heading for Britain. David Cameron said the situation was unacceptable. He has offered to improve the situation and may send staff to help out at Calais. Rail services through the Channel have been returning to normal today after yesterday’s chaos. It might seem like a replay of yesterday’s crisis, but for Calais, this is now what normal looks like. 350 migrants were found inside vehicles in the first few hours of this morning. Some drivers are now simply leaving any checks to the police. The traffic entering the Channel Tunnel was moving this afternoon, but still they sat, waiting to see if Wednesday would be their lucky day. Among them was Abdulaziz, a 2li-year-old Sudanese man who made it to the second border check yesterday, a small setback for someone who has dreams of England for years. someone who has dreams of England foryears. It for years. It is my favourite dream to come here. just to qualify and be intellectual and now how life goes. In need of knowledge. Yesterday’s crisis is giving way to Calais’s normal daily reteam. Some routine. The sheer numbers of migrants here now have changed the game. The head of the Port authority told me the old gentleman ‘s code that used to govern behaviour has gone out of the window. Drivers remember the old days almost with affection. Gentoo attempts to stow away under cover of night, one migrant at a time -- genteel attempts. night, one migrant at a time -- genteelattempts. Now there’s night, one migrant at a time -- genteel attempts. Now there’s a police are outnumbered and the risks are growing. Use it with your doors locked? Well, Iam in a are growing. Use it with your doors locked? Well, I am in a queue for seven hours. I am not going to sit in a truck for seven hours and not open my door or open my window. I am trapped in my truck. Why haven’t we got someone looking out for the truck drivers? Notjust the English drivers. And the police are outnumbered. And for every hundred migrants discovered in Calais, how many others are slipping through? Today, it was another Abdulaziz, also from Sudan, discovered at this British service station. So many years, I dream of England. In a journey of 3500 miles, these are the only step that count. Hesitant, flanked by police, but on British soil. Today David Cameron said he is considering sending extra border police here to help the authorities, but Europe’s leaders meeting in Brussels tomorrow to discuss Europe’s migrant crisis know that policing is only part of the solution, and that this problem is now bigger than any one of them can solve. Lucy Williamson therein Calais. As we heard, David Cameron has said he’s ready to work with the French government to improve security around Calais. EU leaders will discuss the crisis at a summit tomorrow - and the European Commission has proposed that member states adopt a quota system to deal with more than 120,000 people who’ve arrived illegally in the EU so far this year. Clive Myrie is here with more details. For some here in Britain, the numbers of migrants in Calais trying to cross the Channel seems daunting. The French police say around 3,000 are based in temporary camps there. But spare a thought for others in the EU. Of the more than 127,000 refugees and migrants who’ve entered Europe from North Africa and the Middle East by sea so far this year, 62,000 have ended up in Italy, and more than 63,000 in Greece. And there’s an even bigger number to think about. The UN estimates wars and conflict across the globe forced 19.5 million people to flee their homes in 2014, and this year that figure is expected to be higher. In the Commons today, David Cameron focused on those exploiting these vulnerable people - the smugglers. We’ve got to work with European partners to stop this problem at source, to break the link between getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe. In recent months, I’ve visited visited several migrant holding centres in Sicily, every one of them a United Nations of misery. Migrants from Egypt to Nigeria, Afghanistan to Syria, a growing list of people on the move, escaping war, persecution and poverty. Globally, the UN estimates one in every 122 human beings is now eithera refugee, internally displaced or seeking asylum. The situation in the Mediterranean isjust the tip of a huge global phenomenon that has left governments stumped as to what to do. They are squeezed by humanitarian impulses to save lives and offer sanctuary, but also struggling with limited resources and buffeted by electorates wary of migrants at a time of economic hardship. Hungary has taken in more than 60,000 migrants this year, but now the government says it can’t take any more and is thinking of building a wall along the border with Serbia to keep migrants out. But Hungary is a relatively rich state compared to Lebanon. More than1 million refugees from the war in Syria are sheltering there. One in every four people in the country. The stress on local services and infrastructure is reaching breaking point. Syria is haemorrhaging men, women and children on a massive scale. And as the region can no longer cope with these numbers, some of these people no longer able to enjoy protection in the neighbouring countries are moving on now to Europe. A united global policy for dealing with migrants and refugees is sorely needed, but sadly nowhere to be seen. And that’s Europe’s problem too, finding consensus on how best to deal with a worsening humanitarian crisis. The 28 member states don’t want migrants dying in the Mediterranean, but they don’t want to house them either. No-one’s holding their breath for an agreement at tomorrow’s summit of EU leaders in Brussels. In Brussels, talks to try to resolve the Greek debt crisis are set to continue through the night. Earlier, the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, was strongly critical of international creditors for rejecting his latest budget proposals. A meeting of Eurozone finance ministers was cut short this evening as talks between Greece and its international creditors resumed. The Greek banks have been given emergency funding for a third day. For the latest on the talks in Brussels, let’s join Damian Grammaticas. Yes, tonight here in that building behind me, the headquarters of the European Commission, Greece’s prime ministers again locked in talks with his creditors. To resolve the debt crisis, the Greek government says it wants to bring in policies to tax the rich, not hurt the poor, but the creditors say those policies will hurt Greece’s economy and they don’t believe they add up. So tonight, no deal so far and they say the talks will go on for as long as it takes. It’s yet another chance for a deal that has slipped away. Europe’s finance ministers, hoping to put this crisis behind them, achieved little today, leaving Greece one day closer to default. We’ve not reached an agreement yet. But we are determined to continue work. This work will go on during the night, if necessary, and we will reconvene - so we have now adjourned the meeting - and we will reconvene at 1.00pm tomorrow. From early, the omens had not been good. The head of the IMF, who helps control the purse strings, arrived dissatisfied with the deal Greece had offered, still demanding more of its Prime Minister. The decisions Alexis Tsipras is now making are critical ones, for his own political future, for Greece and its 11 million people, and for all the nations that use the euro. He hasjust hours left to make his choices and decide how this crisis will play out. He complained tougher demands are being made of Greece than were of other crisis-hit countries, like Ireland or Portugal. Greece has offered to put up taxes on businesses and higher earners. The lenders say it needs to make cuts to pension benefits, to tax breaks, for farmers and those who live on the Greek islands, and put up VAT on restaurant meals and hotel stays. In Athens, they were waiting for an outcome tonight. TRANSLATION: I trust Tsipras, he’s doing a good job. TRANSLATION: He will have to do a deal anyway, time is being wasted, Greece has been humiliated. Italy’s Prime Minister today warned Athens’ brinkmanship is alienating others in Europe. TRANSLATION: The Greeks and the Greek Government have to understand - and we say this as their friends - that there is tremendous pressure from public opinion in Europe, particularly in some countries, to use this as a window of opportunity to eject Greece from the Eurozone. So tonight in Brussels, Greece is still facing off with its creditors, demanding relief from its debts, even as time runs out. Damian Grammaticas, BBC News, Brussels. David Cameron has been warned that he can’t pick and choose which regulations the UK observes within the European Union. The French Economy Minister, Emmanuel Macron, told the BBC that giving special treatment to one member state could lead to the dismantling of the EU. He was speaking to our Europe editor, Katya Adler, who’s been asking people in various European states for their views on the British demands for reform. Tonight, she reports from Paris. # La mer # Les a berces... # The French are famously - and rightly - proud of their food, their wines, their landscape and literature and much more besides. But France took a real battering in the recent economic crisis and what made that even harder for the French to swallow was that as their grande nation, as they call their country, has struggled, Great Britain next door is on the up. The two countries are allies and are not always the best of friends and it’s thought that France will be the toughest negotiating partner for David Cameron as he pushes for EU reform. And that matters because France remains an EU powerhouse, alongside Germany. We have to be extremely cautious about not to create a sort of EU a la carte. I don’t understand how it’s possible to say we, UK, want to have all the positive reason to be part of the club at 28 and the European passports and the great financial place for all the EU members if we don’t want to share any risk with the other member states. It doesn’t fly. It’s a common responsibility. France’s elite remains staunchly pro-EU. Not so for much of the French public. London Calling is a play about a group of disenchanted Frenchmen who have moved to the UK. The people in the street, I mean the real people, they are really disappointed about what’s really happened, so it was not the dream. The European Union? The European Union. And I have a feeling, if you ask other French people if they want to stay, a lot of them will say no, no, we don’t want to stay. We have good reasons to be good in France. It’s a marvellous country, that’s for sure. But we lost our trust in the future. France is now edging out of its economic slump, but a sense of malaise lingers on, there’s a lot of soul-searching in the French media and many here blame the EU. The governing elite in France worries that an in-out debate in the UK will add fuel to the fire of the Eurosceptics in France. A traditionally anti-immigrant, now anti-EU Front National is hugely popular, but we’re told by a leading thinker here that Euro-scepticism a la francaise has a different flavour to that in the UK. Slightly different in an island like Great Britain, and the key continental actor as France. We don’t need the British debate to be aware of the weaknesses, fallacies and yet indispensability of the European Union. As a founding nation, France feels it knows how the EU heart should beat. Too many Brit-centric demands could be rebuffed. Katya Adler, BBC News, Paris. The Queen has spoken of the dangers of division in Europe and of the need for unity in a speech during her visit to Germany. The Queen’s comments were made at a state banquet in Berlin attended by Chancellor Merkel and by David Cameron. Mr Cameron had earlier held talks with Mrs Merkel, during which they discussed his wish to reform the EU. Our deputy political editor james Landale has more details. The Queen tonight in Berlin at a banquet in her honour on what is now her fifth state visit to Germany. A monarch who lived through a war that tore the Continent apart. With a clear message for the leaders of today. We know the division in Europe is dangerous and that we must guard against it in the West as well as in the East of our continent. Her aide said she was referring not to David Cameron’s planned EU reforms, but the risks of political differences dividing Europe. Earlier, this is the welcome that Berlin gave to the woman they know as ""die Queen"". Germany may have no monarch themselves, but they like this one. Achtung! This visit was notjust about boat like this one. Achtung! This visit was not just about boat trips and ceremonies, it was a chance to strengthen’s Britain relationship with a country that could shape our future in the EU, something for the world’s most famous woman to discuss with Europe’s most powerful woman. Her Chief Minister arrived to meet Chancellor Merkel himself and make his own case for reforming the EU, a case threatened by Europe’s immigration crisis. Today, Mr Cameron was warned not to rely too much on Germany flying the flag for Britain. We are an important partner in Europe, sure, but there are also other partners and this European Union is a European Union with 28 member states. Union is a European Union with 28 memberstates. But member states. But what actually is Mr Cameron hoping for? He wants national parliaments like Westminster and the Bundestag here to have greater powers to club together and block EU laws. At the moment, they can only ask for a rethink. He also wants greater protection against decisions taken by Germany and other Eurozone countries that could damage the City of London and other financial centres outside the Euro. He wants to deter migrants coming to Britain by cutting the benefits they can claim and send home. And he wants an opt-out from the EU’s commitment to ever closer union, to protect Britain if other countries want to integrate further. Tonight, the Prime Minister attended the banquet. Tomorrow, he won’t get such a warm welcome. james Landale, BBC News, Berlin. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories: Around 300 men are suspected of involvement in the sexual exploitation of children in Rotherham. The National Crime Agency’s investigation calls the scale of abuse ‘horrendous’. Its findings follow a report last year that said that at least 1,400 children were abused in the town between 1997 to 2013. The man convicted of bombing the Boston marathon two years ago has apologised in court to his victims and their relatives for the first time. just before he was formally sentenced to death, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rose and said he was sorry for the suffering and irreparable damage that he’d caused. A group of people protesting against changes to disability benefits have tried to enter the Chamber of the House of Commons during Prime Minister’s Questions. Around 30 campaigners - some of them in wheelchairs - tried to force their way past officials and police. They are protesting against changes to the Independent Living Fund. Rebecca Minnock - the woman from Somerset who went on the run with her three-year-old son - has been spared a prison sentence after contempt of court charges against her were dropped at the request of the boy’s father. She’d fled with Ethan at the end of May, the same day a court ordered he should live with Roger Williams. The judge said her conduct had been ‘utterly irresponsible’. The athletics coach Alberto Salazar - whose athletes include Britain’s Mo Farah - has issued his first detailed denial of allegations he was involved in doping. There’s no suggestion that Mo Farah was one of those involved. In an open letter published online, Mr Salazar says he has not - and will not - condone the use of banned substances by any of the athletes he trains. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, has more details. For three weeks, Alberto Salazar promised a detailed defence against the allegations that threatened his reputation, now finally the American coach of Olympic Champion, Mo Farah, has provided it, insisting he believes in clean sport and will never permit doping. Mo Farah takes gold! Salazar had asked for time to gather the evidence that would clear his name after accusations aired in this BBC documentary. But tonight came the response the world of athletics had been waiting for. This meticulous and, at times, impassioned 11,500 word open letter from Alberto Salazar features denial after denial and is accompanied by dozens of pieces of supporting evidence. He says his accusers are lying and he demands a retraction from the BBC. Central to Salazar’s defence against allegations he used testosterone is a personal attack on a fellow coach, seen on the left. Salazar says he had been sacked and that Rupp was taking a legal supplement. Galen says he did not take testosterone in 2002, the notation is an error that cannot be explained. Regarding allegations that Salazar manipulated the system on medical exemptions to enhance performance, the coach insists the number of his athletes on prescription drugs is low. It is clear that the Oregon Project is not manipulating the process in any way, he says. As for the accusation that Salazar had experimented with testosterone, the coach produced e-mails to support his case. He said, ""I’m saddened that these false allegations have been allowed to run with little care..."" The question tonight for Mo Farah, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, is whether his coach has provided the answers the British runner had demanded. Alberto seemed to come up with enough evidence. What I think Mo will think, that is enough for me. I wouldn’t be surprised if they kept that relationship now. Tonight, sportswear giant Nike showed their support for Salazar, saying an internal inquiry had cleared their top endurance coach. The BBC saying they stood by theirjournalism. Farah must decide whether he will stand by his coach. Dan Roan, BBC News. In Madagascar, conservationists are having to take extreme steps to save one of the world’s most endangered species. The ploughshare tortoise is highly prized for its distinctive gold and black shell and commands exceptionally high prices on the international black market. It’s thought there may be fewer than 500 left. So experts have decided to engrave the shells - in effect defacing them - to make them less attractive, as our science editor, David Shukman, explains. On the brink of extinction, one of the most valuable animals on the planet. The ploughsha re tortoise. The intricate and beautiful patterns of their shells makes them highly sought after on the black market. And they’re down to the last few hundred. With a distinctive piece of shelljutting forward, these creatures are in hot demand as pets in China and south-east Asia. An adult can fetch about £24,000. So the charity trying to care for them is taking an extreme and controversial step. Engraving right across the shell, deliberately spoiling the looks of the animals. We watched the process. The tortoises don’t like it, but they don’t seem to be hurt. Desperate times require desperate measures. There’s no way around that. What we are doing now is we are defacing one of the most beautiful animals on the planet. And our whole being, we hate doing it, there’s no way around it. This goes against every fibre of our bodies. A new generation of ploughshare tortoises, tiny and vulnerable. For nearly 30 years this breeding project has tried to boost the dwindling numbers. But the poachers are circling all the time. Two years ago, a suitcase at Bangkok airport was found with 54 baby tortoises, wrapped in cling film, many of them dead. Animals with a price tag of tens of thousands of pounds. So the police have to keep watch around the clock. There have been thefts, and most recently, two smugglers from Taiwan tried to bribe their way in. The problem is that so many of these tortoises don’t even reach this stage in life. And those that do then take 20 years to reach the maturity needed to reproduce. It’s a very slow life-cycle, and the poachers can just wreck it at a stroke. So, as long as the black market price remains high for these animals, extinction remains a real possibility. To see the front line of the battle to keep the tortoises alive in the wild, we travel to one of the remotest corners of Madagascar. Local people are hired to watch over the animals, and they use radio to keep track of them in the forest. Hidden away in a thicket of bamboo, an adult tortoise, fitted with a tracking device. 100 animals bred in captivity have been added to the population in the wild, but numbers are still falling. With all these threats it is kind of difficult to hope that they will survive. But with all of our plans, they might survive. But now there’s a new concern. This area is rich in iron ore. A Chinese company has plans to open a huge mine nearby. Good forjobs, bad for wildlife. So, in the one place where these tortoises live in the wild, there’s yet another threat. A road could slice right through here to a massive new port, which raises a difficult question for Madagascar. It’s an incredibly poor country, but it is also home to creatures that live nowhere else on earth. These animals have existed here for tens of millions of years. And they have coped with every danger thrown at them, until now. The initials of Madagascar are carved into their shells. That may help protect them, but this is a creature on the very edge of survival. David Shukman, BBC News, in Madagascar. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London news. I’m Alex Bushill. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh may need to move out of Buckingham Palace because it’s in major need of repair. It’s thought the refit will cost £150 million and the taxpayer will have to foot the bill. It comes as the annual finances of the palace are published and show the value of the Queen’s estate has increased in value. Ayshea Buksh reports.

145,BBC1 London,21-jun-2015,BBC News,02:05,235 mins,True,"13 in Aberdeen, 14 in Glasgow, probably scrape 20 degrees in the drier South here, for example, in London and on the Channel coast it’ll be cooler still, around 16 Celsius. Now, through the course of Sunday night into Monday we’ll start to see rain spreading from the Atlantic affecting the Southwest of the country so that by very early on Monday morning that rain probably reaching Central Southern England. There’ll be some rain around across Scotland and parts of Northeastern England too but I think the rain in the South will be a little bit more extensive. We have a weather front here across the South, grazing that Southern Channel coast here and it’s separating that warmer air to the South, across parts of France where the high pressure is, that cooler air to the North. You can see where the winds are coming from, all the way from the Norwegian Sea so I think from Eastern Scotland down that North Sea coast it will feel quite chilly. There’ll be plenty of cloud at times, some showers as well whereas that rain will be flirting with the South coast but eventually, on Monday, it will pull away so the afternoon will bring some sunshine but temperatures again on the fresh side. 17 in Glasgow, actually not too bad, but 17 or 19 for the South. So the week ahead, despite that dampy sort of start to the week it is going to be in fact for many of us a mostly dry week with some pretty warm days but the nights are going to be a little on the cool side. So let’s have a look at Monday night into Tuesday, then. We say goodbye to that Southern front, it moves out into the Continent and high pressure squeezes in and we’re between weather systems. One weather system way out towards the East, another one out there in the Atlantic, just nibbling away on Northern Ireland. Perhaps a bit more cloud here but for most of us Tuesday is actually going to be quite a decent day. And then Tuesday night into Wednesday that weather front in the Northwest here that’s nibbling away moves a little bit closer further into Scotland and Northern Ireland so we’ve got a little rain on the way, I think. Some of it could be heavy but I think we’re mostly talking about damp and cloudy conditions. Some of that cloud further Southwest too, the best of the weather will be across the East and the Southeast. And then on Thursday, we’ve got that high pressure nudging into the UK, it is actually going to bring some warmer air from the Continent so I think temperatures across the Southeast of the country could be nudging up to around about the mid-20s. Whereas in the Northwest, we’ve got some cloud and possibly some rain as well. Beyond that, first I want to show you what’s been happening across the US. This is actually the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill when it made landfall across the South of the US some days ago. It’s been travelling across the US and it’ll be zipping out into the North Atlantic by the time we get to early next week and what happens is when we get something tropical moving into Northern climes it disrupts the usual weather patterns. So the thinking is there’ll be a big area of low pressure somewhere around here but remember, when tropical weather systems enter this part of the planet or atmosphere, they really tend to mess things up a little bit so almost quite tricky forecasting the weather. We’re thinking it’ll bring some warmer weather, possibly some windier weather and there might be some rain at times as well. So hopefully we should get mostly dry weather, if dry weather is what you want. That’s it. You’re up-to-date with the latest weather. The safest assets in Greece may also be its most unaffordable. It is 55,000 euros for this. Celia’s family has run this jewellery shop for four generations. She has learned how to negotiate for a deal. She fears that her government has not. I wouldn’t do it like this. You wouldn’t do it? No, I would like to be more safe, more, you know... Stability? Stability, yes. I don’t like to gamble and to be so tough. ""Safety first"" works for many other Greeks as well. This week account holders have withdrawn several billion euros from the country’s banks. The cash withdrawals are dramatic, and the warnings about leaving the euro are now increasingly real. But Greece has still found a way of getting on with normal life. After half a decade living with constant crisis, this country has developed a certain apocalypse fatigue. So where better to take a short break? This lunchtime, this beach south of Athens was full. The sun may have influenced the mood. TRANSLATION: I don’t worry, because everything will work out, as always. We’re optimistic. Greece always makes it. This country now awaits emergency talks in Brussels on Monday. Greece suggests that it may be ready to give way a bit. It needs a deal and a rescue. james Reynolds, BBC News, Athens. Memorial services have been held for two cousins, who were among six people killed on Tuesday, when a balcony they were standing on snapped off the fifth floor of a building in California. 22-year-old Ashley Donohue and her cousin olivia Burke, who is 21, were among those killed when the structure gave way during a party in Berkeley. A vigil was held on Friday for the four other victims, all from Ireland, whose bodies are expected to be repatriated in the coming days. Tens of thousands of people have taken part in anti-austerity marches in London, Liverpool and Glasgow. They have called for the Government to halt planned cuts. But tonight, the Chancellor George osborne and the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith have repeated their intention to reduce spending on working-age benefits by £12 billion - that is $19 billion a year. Tom Symonds has this report. They filled the streets, from the Bank of England, the city’s financial heart, towards Westminster, the centre of political power. The police no longer estimate protest numbers. The organisers claimed 250,000. Some had to queue up to march. There were thousands of placards, thousands of opinions, and one key demand - an end to austerity. We have to balance our books, but at the detriment of the people, no. There’s got to be some way around it. We’re here to support people who are disabled, and deaf people, we want equal rights. That’s why we’re here today. I think a lot of people have given up. It’s not that they want austerity, it’s that they’ve given up fighting it. This is the largest protest since the election result, with austerity very much part of the campaign. People are here for a variety of reasons, many of them public-sector workers. But they say that this is a battle against austerity that will go on for a generation. Austerity is not the only option. It’s unnecessary, it’s unethical, and we’re not going to have it. A watching supporter of austerity didn’t doubt what he called the earnestness of the protesters, but... The honest truth is we need to crack on with it. We’re still spending £75 billion a year more than we bring in. just yesterday, new figures had us at more than £1.5 trillion in debt. CROWD: Revolution! Revolution! Some came in black, masked and with fireworks. At one point, they broke away from the main march and tried to block roads, but policing was light, there was little trouble. Protesters accepted that however well supported, marches rarely change policies, but they promised there will be more. Tom Symonds, BBC News, Westminster. The oscar-winning actress Angelina jolie has pleaded for the world to do more for refugees who have displaced by war or persecution. She made the appeal while visiting the Syrian border for World Refugee Day to highlight the plight of victims of Islamic State militants. As a UN Refugee Agency special envoy, she called on the United Nations Security Council to reach a political solution to end conflict there. People are running out of places to run to. If you are Iraqi or Syrian, fleeing violence, where do you go? Every border country is being pushed to its limits. That is why we see so many people dying at sea. It is not a new trend. It is a result of those fleeing country after country, and finding no safe place. These are not economic migrants looking for a better life. These are desperate refugees fleeing war and persecution. The average stay for a refugee in a protracted refugee situation is 25 years. So think of your own life. Think of what that would mean. For many, that is your entire childhood and beyond. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: Is this Germany’s new opera star? A robot takes centre stage at an opera in Berlin. This is BBC News, the headlines: New pictures have emerged of the man charged with shooting dead nine black people at a church in South Carolina. Tuareg rebels in Mali have signed a peace deal intended to end decades of conflict with the government. A British Army parachutist has escaped unharmed after his chute failed to open during an air show. His team-mate caught him in mid-air in front of stunned spectators who were watching the Red Devils display team. The two men became entangled before plunging into the water at a marina. A routine stunt which went wrong. This is the moment two Red Devils collided with each other, hundreds of feet above the ground. To the untrained eye, the two men seemed out of control. But years of training and quick thinking saved the day. With one skydiver wrapped in the other’s parachute, the experienced Red Devils guided each other safely into the nearby harbour. I looked up, seen the parachute was a little bit wrapped around, so pretty much straightaway you realise it’s not exactly how we planned to do it. But then the training kicks in. Members of the Parachute Regiment of the British Army, we always train for every eventuality. So then we look at implementing the plan we always have in the back of our minds if something does happen like that. But on the ground, things looked quite serious for a few heart-stopping moments. You could see them wrestling to get control. And in, you know, what has to be an incredible piece of skill. One managed to land over here, about 700 metres from the original drop zone. It was just breathtaking to watch, to be honest. I mean, everyone was expecting a tragedy and these guys pulled it off and it was just incredible. And this is what the spectators at the Whitehaven Air Show were hoping to see. Skydivers from the Parachute Regiment stacked on top of each other in a spectacular display. So will this incident put them off? No, we’ve got a full season ahead of us, what we’ve got to look forward to this year, another 1+0 displays to do this year, which we’ll hopefully get done with the nice weather. Fortunately, no-one was injured and the Red Devils will be back in action tomorrow. But for now, one para says he owes the other a drink. A pint of beer, maybe, yeah. joe Lynam, BBC News. A small robot, the same size as an eight-year-old child, is the star of an opera performance at Berlin’s Komische opera. The robot, known as Myon, plays in the performance of My Square Lady. Our correspondent Peter Dobbie explains. This is My Fair Lady with a twist, otherwise known as My Square Lady. A small robot the same size as a primary school child is the star of this performance of Berlin’s Komische opera. The robot, developed by the Berlin Humboldt University, is known as Myon. He or she, we haven’t been told which, gives it his/her best. Not exactly belting out songs from the shows, but rather trying to learn what it means to be human, what emotions feel like. For us, the robot is a means to look at ourselves as humans, and to ask the question what makes us human. And what differentiates us from a machine, or an object. And empathy and the ability to feel are quite crucial, I think. This performance apparently allows the robot and the audience to experience the same cascade of emotions, in an environment that is totally unique, in a theatre. And it is, they say, that mechanism that guides the process. Emotions decide where to go with the attention, and so there is an attentional frame. Should the robot focus on the object, or does it get boring, and has there been a noise? And so the robot turns to the side. It is the emotional mechanisms which are in place, and guide the process. Spare a thought for Myon, however. He, or she, doesn’t survive the performance. As part of the apparent desire to discover what makes a robot tick, he or she is taken to bits on stage, and passed from cast member to cast member. Those German opera fans really know how to have a good time. Saudi Arabia has warned its citizens not to read or distribute documents that might be faked in an apparent response to the release by Wikileaks of a huge batch of Saudi diplomatic cables. More than sixty-thousand have so far been made public. Wikileaks says the cables reveal how the Saudis have used their political and financial power to try to control the Arab media. The BBC’s Sebastian Usher explains. We are seeing a confirmation of a pattern, that the Saudis exert a lot of influence behind the scenes. This is the point that Wikileaks is trying to make in its press release, that essentially these cables should show how the Saudis have tried to control the Arab media through different strategies. Through essentially paying them off. If these cables are genuine, which we have been able to verify some of them but obviously there are tens of thousands, there is some evidence, more concrete than perhaps we have had before, of this. One strategy is to buy up subscriptions of newspapers and magazines to support them, and there is a cable that gives information about this across the Arab world. I don’t think this is anything new to people watching Saudi Arabia. Tens of millions of people are taking part in the first World International Yoga Day today. After a major push by India, 192 of the UN member countries are marking this celebration of the ancient technique to find spiritual calm and physical strength. The meditation exercise seeks to synchronise body, mind and breath and is recognised as having numerous physical and psychological benefits. The word yoga is derived from the Sanskrit word yuj, which means to unify. In Delhi, the Indian government is to lead the celebration of Yoga. Tens of thousands of people are expected on the stately Rajpath, Kings Avenue, in the heart of the capital as part of the Prime Minister’s plan to get 35,000 people to perform yoga for 35 minutes. And if it comes together they will set a new Guinness World Record for the largest yoga class at a single venue. Our correspondentjustin Rowlatt is in Delhi. Tell us about what you are seeing on the ground. Presumably the mood is very calm and serene. It is a truly spectacular way to mark this first international world Yoga day. 35,000 people are gathered on the lawn in front of the Indian parliament. They are all sitting cross-legged at the moment listening to an address from the Indian PM, Narendra Modi. He is a great champion of Yoga, he practices it himself, he set up the Yoga ministry in India and he has lobbied for the UN to have this day. It is a huge celebration in India. You say he is a huge champion of Yoga but there has been a lot of criticism by some Muslim groups who say this is an attempt to marginalise other non- Hindu cultures. What more can you tell us? That has been an argument that part of the agenda is to promote their Hindu nationalist agenda. It has been roundly rejected by the government, which says this is about health and happiness, many Muslim leaders have come out in support saying that Yoga is a non- faith tradition. There has been some tension around that, but it hasn’t dominated. A lot of people have come out, with 5000 people gathered on the lawn, 35,000 people gathered on the lawn, about to begin the world’s biggest yoga lesson. It is notjust Delhi, it is also taking place in New York on Bangkok and Manila, 192 countries taking part. This tell us about how it is being viewed in India in terms of the success in pushing Indian cultural influence and Indian soft power. That is at the heart of what Narendra Modi is trying to do. He has recognised that Yoga is a popular tradition around the world and he would like to reconnected with India, because it has been overtaken in the west by Western practitioners. It is not an export in itself, but it is a way of saying thatit in itself, but it is a way of saying that it is part of this great nation and something India has given the world. They say it is the second greatest contribution after. .. world. They say it is the second greatest contribution after... I will have to cutting, thank you very much. That is it for this programme, thank you for watching. Hello there. We are now into the early morning of the 21st ofjune. The summer solstice, the longest day. Now the date of this can vary. Some years it is the 20th, some years the 22nd ofjune. But this year the 21st is the day, and with all that extra daylight to enjoy, wouldn’t it be good to have some sunshine to make the most of it? Well there are some sunny spells in the forecast. Some showers too, particularly in northern areas. Generally I think quite a lot of cloud actually on Saturday. From the Midlands southwards we will see some breaks in that cloud, and it should stay largely dry. Further north though, there will be some showers. Across Northern Ireland, we will see some of those through the afternoon. This is lI:Oopm. Some sunny spells as well. Quite a cool, fresh feel, 14 degrees in Belfast. Across Scotland, particularly eastern Scotland, some of the showers could be slow-moving and heavy, possibly with some rumbles of thunder. For the far north and the Northern Isles, it is likely to stay quite cloudy through the day, with some persistent rain. Sunshine and showers through northern England. 15 degrees there in Manchester. Come further south, though, through the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east, it looks largely dry, often with large amounts of cloud. You’ll notice a cooler, fresher feel after a humid and muggy Saturday. A rather cooler affair. 16 degrees in Plymouth, a mixture of cloud and some bright spells. A similar story in Wales, maybe the odd shower across the north Wales. As we go through Sunday night, northern areas will continue to see some showers. Some clearer spells too. More cloud throwing itself in across the south, with this belt of rain which is going to try a nudge its way in. Now I have to say, this rain band is associated a really wiggling weather front, that can’t quite make up its mind exactly where it wants to go. So there is a bit of uncertainty about exactly where this wet weather will be on Monday morning. It could well be, though, that southern areas of England see some outbreaks of rain first thing. That then pulling away to the south, to leave actually a decent day for many, with some brightness, some sunshine particularly in the west, some showers continuing in eastern parts until Monday afternoon. Still, with that cool, fresh feel to the weather. 12 degrees in Aberdeen, 17 in Cardiff, 19 in London. Into Tuesday, a lot of dry weather again. A fair amount of cloud, with some spells of sunshine. Frontal systems trying to invade from the Atlantic, so more cloud and perhaps some splashes of rain eventually into Northern Ireland. Now, this flabby area of high pressure is trying to keep charge of our weather. However, this bending frontal system tries to nose its way into the north-west during Wednesday. So for the middle of the week, Northern Ireland and Scotland look like seeing some rain. Further south it should remain largely dry. The headlines on BBC News: Pictures have emerged of the gunman accused of killing nine people at an African-American church in South Carolina. Dylan Roof is seen posing with a gun and burning the US flag. He appeared in court on Saturday charged with the murders of the worshippers during a prayer meeting. A peace deal has been signed in Mali, aimed at ending decades of conflict between the government and ethnic Tuareg rebels. The government has agreed more regional autonomy for the Tuareg, and has dropped arrest warrants for their leaders. Greece has said it will offer further concessions to its creditors, in a last-minute attempt to unlock billions of euros desperately needed by the country. Eurozone leaders will gather for an emergency meeting in Brussels on Monday, to try to resolve the current standoff. Now on BBC News, Dateline London. Hello and welcome to Dateline London. Greece, Grexit and the future of the euro. Plus Isis and its fellow travellers. My guests today are Stryker McGuire of Bloomberg Markets. Maria Margaronis, of The Nation. Nabila Ramdani, who is a French-Algerianjournalist. And Polly Toynbee of the Guardian. That tired old metaphor used about the euro crisis was ""kicking the can down the road"" and never reaching a conclusion about what to do. But have we reached the end of the road as far as Greece is concerned, especially since Greek savers have begun to panic about their money in the banks? 5 billion, according to the Financial Times has been taken out in a week. How do you see the situation, there is supposed to be a final deadline? The final deadline comes when there is no more money in the Greek ranks and the ECB is continuing to increase liquidity assistance. The ECB has decided not to make the decision on its own. There is hysteria being generated, some of it in the form of leaks from eurozone meetings and people saying the European Commissioners are saying the banks might not open on Monday. The governor of the Bank of Greece himself, a former Finance Minister, issuing warnings that if they do not have a deal soon Greece might leave the eurozone, even the EU. It is unhelpful. People in Greece have been surprisingly calm. A lot of money has left the banks but there are not vast queues at cash machines. People’s nerves are shattered, they walk past the newstands like this and turn off the television. I think we need to take the focus of these negotiations. My feeling is there will be another kicking of the can down the road because no one is ready for the cataclysm that will follow if Greece defaults, which might lead to an exit from the eurozone, then the EU. Nobody knows what happens in that case. We have to come to a solution that is notjust kicking the can down the road, because it cannot go on. Greece needs debt relief, which the IMF knows. One of the reasons why the IMF walked out of the talks was notjust because of frustration with the Greeks, but because of frustration with eurozone partners who won’t cou ntenanmce debt relief. Christine Lagarde said they have to talk to grown-ups. She is cross with Varoufakis, but another made a post saying, basically, we have to think about debt relief. And the Eurozone partners will not think about that, because it will not go down well with the electorate. But Greek debt is totally unsustainable. And getting worse. Something has to be done - debt relief, investment, real reform, everybody knows this. And the markets know it as well. They have kind of priced this in. Last week you would expect the markets everywhere to be moving up and down, back and forwards, but it was only happening in Europe, not elsewhere. Because it has been discounted, number one, and they discounted both the Grexit and not a Grexit. I mean, they are basically saying, forget it. However, what is different is that in capitals around the world, like Washington, they are paying a lot of attention to this, because there is a huge geopolitical dimension to this. All you have to do is something very old-fashioned, and that is look at a map and look at where Greece is and then where North Africa is, where Russia is, look at Turkey, which itself, like Greece, a Nato member, it is kind of changing its attitude towards the West, whatever that means these days. Then you have Syria, Iraq, on Turkey’s borders. And refugees moving in, a human sign of the geopolitical stress. So many have said the common-sense thing is for there to be a deal, except nobody can quite figure out what it would be. It will involve some debt forgiveness of some kind. It has to happen, because they can’t possibly pay. There has been quite a bit of that. 250 billion, roughly, in bailouts. It is a lot of money. The NHS budget is 90 billion. There will have to be solutions that make it look... This is where it gets tricky. Because Merkel wants to do something, but she has to do something that curries favour with her own electorate. So she has that problem. Tsipras has a similar problem. He goes one way or another, if he performs badly he is out. We have always heard that the euro is a political project, which has an economic dimension, and so there has to be a political solution which means Angela Merkel effectively deciding what it is. Well I think more fundamentally, the golden rule of EU membership is it is conditional, and Greece has been told that time and again. It has not satisfied the economic standards for that membership and yet we have another elected Greek government resisting rule makers. And I think we are as close to the end of the road we can get, and it is notjust the Greeks who should be panicking, it’s actually all the countries in the monetary union. The Greeks could strike a deal with creditors, they could get fresh aid and avoid default, but my betting is we will be back in the same position very soon afterwards. We have heard the Greek Prime Minister saying that he wants to stay in the euro, but the reality is that bank withdrawals are creating pressures, and in countries like Germany, the fear is providing new loans for Greece, without extracting some sort of... more spending cuts, effectively, would represent more transfer union. Effectively wealthier nations providing hand-outs to weaker nations like Greece. With the political problems that we were just talking about a moment ago for Merkel and others. To put it in dramatic terms, it would mean weaker nations like Greece effectively blackmailing other members into a transfer union without controls, or indeed regulations, and that is the I’â3SOIâ1. . . LAUGHTER. Ihearsighs! If you look at the Greek economy and the German economy, you will see that the Greek economy has gone down the tubes and the German economy is continuing to grow. It is notjust a question of stronger nations helping weaker nations, it is a system that does not work for the weaker nations because they cannot compete. A design fault at the heart of the euro. Exactly, what Angela Merkel needs to say to her country is the extraordinary amounts of money they have made out of the eurozone, that they, by being the strong currency, they have sucked money out of the weaker countries. They have been able to trade and export greatly to their advantage and to the disadvantage of the weaker countries. That is where their growth has come from. So the question facing Europe is doe it believe in itself or not? I mean, Greece was a pivotal point, everybody knew it was weak when it joined, but looking at its recent history of dictatorship, pulling it into permanently the civilised group of nations within the EU, guaranteeing that they would stay a democracy, these are very important things. We are in the middle of a time of, for some reason, massive celebrations of ends of war, whether it was Waterloo, the First World War, the Second World War. It is only 70 years since Europe was fighting itself, that’s a very short time in terms of the history of Europe. And I think people have to understand how Europe falling apart would be really dangerous. The idea we could not be back at 1914just isn’t true. But also it is not that long since Greece was a military dictatorship. No, it’s not. It fell in 1974, and joining the EU, and the eurozone was very much, as Polly says, a symbol of that terrible time ending. Before that, the Greek Civil War, ending in 1949, followed by 30 years of powerful political repression. And one of the things that is worrying is watching how polarisation in Greece has grown. It has always been a polarised society, and the gap between rich and poor has grown. Last week there were demonstrations, one was anti-austerity, the other, the next day, was a demonstration called We Want To Stay In Europe - And that was something that began on Facebook but was taken up and used by the opposition parties, who are doing their utmost to undermine the Syriza government. This is a dangerous situation for Greece. Going forward, it is like having a club with a long-standing member who flouts the rules. And the club has an alternative - it can relax rules, or it can throw out the member. If it throws out the member, it will be the beginning of the end for Europe. The markets will look at... They will look at weaker countries. In the process of going it alone, it will go through a time of deprivation, very likely the Syriza party will be gone and it is likely you could see the rise of a neofascist movement. You mentioned the rules. I don’t think it is either/or. I think Greece has changed and probably there will be permanent structural changes in Greece. I mean Greece, the management of the economy was appalling, it must have been embarrassing to Greeks everywhere, the fact that from 2000, up to 2007, it was one of the largest and fastest-growing economies in Europe and every single year they ran a government deficit. There is no excuse for that. A lot of those problems, they will change. This is what ought to have happened from the time there was a change of government. And Syriza said they wanted to sort out corruption. Varoufakis is still saying it. They have not done enough and they admit it. They need to get a grip on this. This is where the Europeans could have helped. You cannot make those changes with a gun to your head. Can I ask you a final point - is it Vladimir Putin to the rescue? God help us all! This is very complicated. Greece and Russia have an old relationship, co-religion, Orthodox faith. The Greek left has always sort of looked towards Russia and even now there is a sort of romantic connection to Russia. Tsipras is partly playing a diplomatic game, saying look, Europeans, I have friends elsewhere. Russia has no money to give to Greece. They have apparently signed a dealfor a gas pipeline, although I have not seen any concrete evidence of this. When I hear on the radio that President Putin has asked Europeans to be nice to Greece, I thought, please, we do not need friends like these. It is quite clever. It might be the only alternative left for Greece if it is thrown out and it is a serious matter. The geopolitics are crucial. Moving on, in the days of the great ideological struggle between Communism and capitalism, those on the left who were broadly sympathetic to the aims of the Soviet Union were often described as ""fellow travellers"". This week, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, warned against those within some Muslim communities who ""quietly condone"" the ideology of so-called Islamic State. Is he right to raise concerns about Isis fellow travellers in Britain and elsewhere? What did you think of the speech? I found the Prime Minister’s use of the words ""quietly condoning""' particularly insidious, because it conjured up the image of thousands of otherwise peaceful and well-integrated Muslims gently nodding in agreement as they contemplate the next IS decapitation or burning. If you suggested that thousands of Americans were quietly condoning the racism and hatred of humanity which prompts white American shooters to regularly murder fellow citizens, there would be an outcry, and yet because a tiny minority of misguided individuals travel tojoin IS, we suddenly have to imagine numerous European Muslims support them. It could not be further from the truth and it is deeply offensive. Yes, David Cameron has the legal authority to prevent people from joining groups like IS and other terrorist organisations, that is hisjob, but he is manipulating his legal authority to stigmatise a community. He is falling into the classic trap of speaking in terms of generic groups, rather than concentrating on a tiny minority of criminally minded radicals. This is not a courageous dialogue, it is, you know, scaremongering of the highest order. All it does is stir up hatred and mistrust. Leaving aside the Prime Minister’s remarks and whether he should have said it differently, there is a worry in this country there are some people who are ideologues, who do not quite dirty their hands in violence, not many of them, but that nothing can be done about these people because they stir up hatred that do not directly get involved. It is like the time of Irish terrorism, there was a general smear against anybody Irish - oh, they may be fellow travellers. But there was a small part of the Irish community who was sympathetic and the American Irish community actually funding the IRA from afar when they were not suffering. There are always levels of sympathy. There is no doubt when you see very extreme religious practice, very disciplinarian attitudes, strong attitudes, repressing women in certain parts of that community, you are afraid this breeds an idea that it might not exactly support Islamic State, and it is complicated, depending who is Sunni and Shia and so on. But you have a sense it is not a good idea. That the idea of Islamic schools in this country, often quite extreme, they are a bad idea. The idea the state is allowing free schools to be set up, any religious free schools. I am a humanist and atheist. I would say this. Any state encouragement for religious separatism is toxic. Given your views you would take issue with a minority of clergy within the Church of England who say certain things about homosexuality you do not like, but that is part... Why some Muslim clergy or others shouldn’t have some arguments about homosexuality or other things, that is part of diversity in Britain. It has to do with how different people feel. But I think that when you look at the radicalisation of some young people, it is mostly for social reasons. They are disaffected, left behind, they feel oppressed by a strict background when they are caught between two cultures. It is difficult and not necessarily the fault of a particular mosque or group of people. There are strands of extreme beliefs which I think is right for the state to be afraid of. I wonder, leaving aside the precise words of the Prime Minister, that you look at what any government can do about this problem and all governments are slightly flailing around. With people who did not commit offences, do you restrict their behaviour, is that against civil liberties? It is difficult for any government to know what to do. You have to be realistic. There will be people who will go and fight for causes and causes that we agree with, causes we disagree with. There is only so much you can do about that. just as there are people who go to fight with Isis, there are people from this country and the US who have gone to fight against Isis. There is so much really you can do. You do not want to be hysterical and you do not want to be a politician stirring up hysteria. Then you get into a situation, like in the US, after Pearl Harbor, where the majority of japanese-Americans were interned. And they were loyal Americans? Of course. It can spin out of control easily, especially with the internet that we are blaming it on, and the internet that is also a medium of free speech. The fact is hysteria can grow quickly. That is why what the Prime Minister says... What we say does not matter, what the Prime Minister says matters and he should have been more careful. This was a general smear of the kind that is dangerous and that will alienate a lot of the Muslim community. And he undermined the work of the many Muslims in this country who are trying very hard to prevent radicalisation. Making a speech insula Berkshire rather than Britain I thought was an odd move. It is as if it puts him outside this country as if he is afraid of saying things he -- as if he is afraid of saying things he -- in Slovakia. Can we talk about how the majority of Muslims should deal with this problem of radicalisation? I was talking to a man the other day who pointed out that more Muslims are being killed by other Muslims because of these ideas. It is a Muslim problem. More specifically so, and Polly was hinting that social problems and deprivation as the root causes of radicalisation but it may well be that a lot of Muslims object to the wars that have reduced countries like Iraq and Afghanistan to hotbeds of radicalism. Extrajudicial killings have gone on for years, and the military powers of countries like America make sure they are far better rated than the enemies. There is absolutely no doubt that the intense violence used by America to export its brand of freedom ideology has helped to radicalise people in war-torn countries, and that doesn’t mean that Muslims support groups like ISIS, quite the opposite. That is the height of hypocrisy from David Cameron when he supports countries, defence countries, like Saudi Arabia, which seems to outperform groups like Islamic State in its cruelty and savagery. It also funded and financed many of these revolutionaries Islamic organisations. Saudi Arabia is on its way to outdoing its beheading record from last year, yet the British government quietly condones a country like that. That is tied up with another geostrategic question, about how to deal with other Islamic countries like Egypt. There has been some talk in recent years that because the US is becoming less dependent on the Saudis for example for oil, that maybe the relationship with Saudi Arabia could change. There doesn’t seem to be too much sign of that. There is a multibillion-dollar deal at stake as far as trade is concerned between Saudi Arabia and the UK. Exactly. just to try to pursue a more positive point, as you know, in this country, one of the big stories has been £3 women with their children, 12 people in total, who have gone to Syria tojoin 12 people in total, who have gone to Syria to join Islamic State Syria tojoin Islamic State -- these three women. A neighbour of one of the women has told the BBC that she felt completely out of stride with rigid community. You cannot blame people if they do not want to be here, but it is peculiar to most of us at someone would choose ISIS over living in this country. We have to remember that we are talking about a tiny minority of people, and those figures that keep being bandied around, I would condemn the tiny minority of people who make their choice. But the idea that young women, that there are hundreds of young women who would leave a stable, safe, good families, to choose a life of abject horror and discomfort, is absolutely ludicrous. I think ISIS is very good at making people feel at home, and Muslim communities take the danger of radicalisation very seriously. There was a very good comment piece by Baroness Warsi about efforts put forward by the Muslim community is either in community centres or mosques, or in a public space, to speak to young people and to make them realise that this is home. That suggests a more positive way of looking at it, which is that Muslim leaders in various communities have questions about how to get through to them, and how to get through to people who are very difficult to get through to, like second or third generation people. Think it has been very difficult for governments, whether it is this final the previous, to understand. These are white, non- Muslim governments, who have very little understanding, as I don’t either, of the various different movements within the Muslim community, and I think it is quite hard to get it right is a government. On one hand you don’t want to support people who turn out to be importing fiery clerics from outside, or people who are totally irrelevant to the young people who need to be approached. Supporting the right kinds of movements within the community to support this difficult. I think they were probably wrong to sack Baroness Warsi who seems to be quite well plugged in and have a good idea of who could be back. I think it is because she is difficult, Cameron got rid of her. I think he finds women difficult anyway. You are moving into a subject that will get us into deep trouble! Finally, the government is thinking of more legislation in this area, and it will be a huge difficulty because there are all kinds of civil liberties groups that can see the problems of so-called thought crimes. The government has a tiny majority, I think it will be very difficult. As we have discussed, it is clear that we understand that something has to be done but it has to be done intelligently and in a balanced way, and it can’t become hysterical. That’s it for Dateline London for this week. You can comment on the programme on Twitter @gavinesler. We are back next week at the same time. Make a date with Dateline. Goodbye. Hello there.

Chilling images have emerged online that appear to show a gunman, accused of killing nine African-Americans at a US church, burning the American flag. Dylann Roof appears holding weapons and posing with a Confederate flag, a symbol used during the Civil War by southern US states opposed to the abolition of slavery. Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from Charleston. New images of Dylann Roof paint a chilling picture of the 21-year-old. These images show him at sites in and around Charleston, associated with this area’s history of slavery, and its divided racial past. Roof’s friends showed me around the trailer, a few hours from Charleston, where he had been staying in the run-up to the shooting. They told me he had talked about attacking the university the week before. But they never believed he would go through with it. He told me that the Church wasn’t his primary target at all. That’s why my heart goes out to those nine families, because you guys weren’t the ta rg ets. What does that mean? He wanted to shoot the school up, UCA, the University of Charleston. He just stopped talking about it, he said they will have seven days to live. A week later, charged with nine counts of murder, Roof appeared before a judge via videolink. He is now in solitary confinement as he awaits trial. Tonight, floral tributes continue to grow, but some things remain untouched, like this sign, advertising Sunday service led by the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, one of the victims. Tomorrow, the church will reopen for a small private service in honour of those who lost their lives. At least three people have been killed and dozens injured, after a man drove his car at high speed into a crowded square in Austria’s second-largest city of Graz. The driver has been arrested. Authorities say the man is mentally unbalanced, and ruled out any political motive for the attack. Gronyea Harrington reports. By the time emergency services arrived at the main square in Graz, it was too late. Three people were dead and dozens more injured, including several children. Witnesses said the car was travelling at about 100 kilometres per hour when the driver rammed it straight through a crowded pedestrian zone in the hub of the old city as families were shopping on a sunny Saturday. He then got out of the car and stabbed two people, before he was finally arrested, leaving a trail of bodies on the road. TRANSLATION: All of a sudden, police were pulling a man out of the car. People were calling from the main square, crying, ""call the ambulance. Call the ambulance."" Then I saw them, one after the other. Luckily, a lot of doctors seem to be around. It’s unbelievable. I tried to leave, but it was hard, because there were people lying everywhere. As victims were taken to local hospitals, more details emerged about the driver. The 26-year-old father of two was under a restraining order since his wife had accused him of domestic violence. Detectives said he handed him self over without resistance, after stopping his rampage near a police station.

Still to come: Lewis Hamilton spins his way to pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix - his seventh pole in eight races. A three-week-old baby has died after being attacked by the family dog in Sunderland. Police say they were called to the home after reports that a newborn boy had been bitten by a terrier. Danny Savage reports. This is three-week-old baby Reggie Young, found badly injured in the early hours of this morning, after being attacked by his family’s pet dog. Police were called to his home in Sunderland shortly after 4:00am. Shocked neighbours have been leaving flowers here all afternoon. They had met the new arrival in their street in recent days. He was a really bonnie little lad. He was a lovely bairn, he was. And what do you make of what happened? It’s a shock. It is, a shock more than anything else. You cannae get over it. Police have spent the day examining the home and garden. The dog involved is described as being a small terrier, which detectives have taken away. This evening, a relative of the family told us the dog was usually kept in a brick outhouse in the back garden at night. And he couldn’t understand why it was in the house. He was too upset to be interviewed, but he also said that as far as he was aware, the dog was always well- behaved around children. The dog is a small terrier type family pet, it was the family pet from the home. So not a dog that you would associate with being a dangerous animal. Family members have briefly visited the home this afternoon as investigations continue. A 30-year-old man understood to be the baby’s father has been arrested and is being questioned by detectives following this shocking death. Three teenagers have been charged in connection with the death of 14-year-old jordan Watson. The schoolboy was found dead in a cemetery in Carlisle on Tuesday. 18-year-old George Thomson and 19-year-olds Brahnn Finley and Danieljohnston are accused of murder. More now from our news correspondent, Danjohnson. When jordan’s body was found on Tuesday morning, officers said he had been victim to a savage and brutal attack. He had been stabbed in the head and neck multiple times. There was a big appeal for information, four people were arrested in total over the last few days, a 16-year-old boy was released on bail and three men from Carlisle have been charged. They are 18 and 19 years old respectively. All three will appear in court on Monday morning. This week we had a statement from jordan’s family about him. They described a little more about him to the media when they were appealing for information, and the police have said thank you for the information that has led to arrests. The family said he wasn’t a perfect boy, but that he was the most loving and caring child anyone could meet. They say he had the best sense of humour, he lived by his motto, and had a strong personality and a love of the outdoors, and a love of Liverpool Football Club as well. So a lot of upset in the city over the shocking murder of a child just 14 years old. Tens of thousands of people have taken part in anti-austerity marches in cities across the UK. The largest protest was in London, where figures including the labour leadership candidate jeremy Corbyn and the singer Charlotte Church told a crowd that they opposed further Government spending cuts. Tom Symonds reports. They filled the streets, from the Bank of England, the city’s financial heart, towards Westminster, the centre of political power. The police no longer estimate protest numbers. The organisers claimed 250,000. Some had to queue up to march. There were thousands of placards, thousands of opinions, and one key demand - an end to austerity. We have to balance our books, but at the detriment of the people, no. There’s got to be some way around it. We’re here to support people who are disabled, and deaf people, we want equal rights. That’s why we’re here today. I think a lot of people have given up. It’s not that they want austerity, it’s that they’ve given up fighting it. This is the largest protest since the election result, with austerity very much part of the campaign. People are here for a variety of reasons, many of them public-sector workers. But they say that this is a battle against austerity that will go on for a generation. Austerity is not the only option. It’s unnecessary, it’s unethical, and we’re not going to have it. A watching supporter of austerity didn’t doubt what he called the earnestness of the protesters, but... The honest truth is we need to crack on with it. We’re still spending £75 billion a year more than we bring in. just yesterday, new figures had us at more than £1.5 trillion in debt. CROWD: Revolution! Revolution! Some came in black, masked and with fireworks. At one point, they broke away from the main march and tried to block roads, but policing was light, there was little trouble. Protesters accepted that however well supported, marches rarely change policies. But they promised there will be more. Tom Symonds, BBC News, Westminster. More now on the situation in Greece - Athens has said it will offer further concessions to its creditors, in a last-minute attempt to unlock billions of euros desperately needed by the country. The announcement comes ahead of an emergency EU summit on Monday. As Greece teeters on the edge, our correspondent james Reynolds reports on the mood amongst its people. The safest assets in Greece may also be its most unaffordable. It is 55,000 euro for this. Celia Xanthopoulos’s family has run thisjewellery shop for four generations. She has learned how to negotiate for a deal. She fears that her government has not. I wouldn’t do it like this. You wouldn’t do it? No, I would like to be more safe, more, you know... Stability? Stability, yes. I don’t like to gamble and to be so tough. ""Safety first"" works for many other Greeks as well. This week account holders have withdrawn several billion euros from the country’s banks. The cash withdrawals are dramatic, and the warnings about leaving the euro are now increasingly real. But Greece has still found a way of getting on with normal life. After half a decade living with constant crisis, this country has developed a certain apocalypse fatigue. So where better to take a short break? This lunchtime, this beach south of Athens was full. The sun may have influenced the mood. TRANSLATION: I don’t worry, because everything will work out, as always. We’re optimistic. Greece always makes it. This country now awaits emergency talks in Brussels on Monday. Greece suggests that it may be ready to give way a bit. It needs a deal and a rescue. james Reynolds, BBC News, Athens. BBC News has learned that the British man killed fighting for the terrorist group Al Shabab in Kenya was one of the leaders of an attack on a military base. Thomas Evans, from High Wycombe, was the group’s cameraman, and filmed the raid in which he died. Our East Africa correspondent Karen Allen reports from Mpeketoni in Kenya. Apparently pictured in this Al-Shabab video, Thomas Evans, the British fighter, in hisjungle hideout. These images capture him before he was killed in a thwarted attack on Sunday. But we now know he spent time on the other side of the lens. He was Al-Shabab’s cameraman, filming and firing his weapon until the moment he died. He was commanding, ""shoot this one. Don’t use a firearm. Slaughter this one.""' He was ordering. On the material day, the video was on. The film was on his body taking any movement and action, and the shooting of soldiers. The grim task of identifying bodies underway. Thomas Evans was among 11 Al-Shabab fighters killed as they tried to storm a military base. The Briton was said to be the second-in-command. That camera and Thomas Evans’ high-calibre machine-gun are now in the hands of the intelligence services, as investigators try to build up a profile of Britain’s first-ever Al-Shabab fighter to be killed here in Kenya. They will want to know whether he had contact with other foreign fighters, where his networks were, and who he took orders from. Police here suspect Thomas Evans had actually struck before, after he slipped into Kenya unnoticed last year. This is the aftermath of an Al-Shabab killing spree in which more than 70 people died. Survivors described seeing a light-skinned man among the gunmen. This local barber caught a glimpse of him, metres away from a rooftop. This guy was standing close to a pick-up. There was a pick-up behind. He was standing behind that. He had a gun on his back. But he has this, do you call it a laptop? He had a laptop. He had not even covered his hair. What colour was his hair? Let me say brown, like your hair. Thomas Evans may be the first British Al-Shabab fighter to be killed in Kenya. But with about 100 other known recruits, it is feared he won’t be the last. Karen Allen, BBC News, Northern Kenya. This is BBC News, the headlines:. New pictures have emerged of the man charged with shooting dead 9 black people at a church in South Carolina. Police in Austria have arrested a driver who ploughed into a crowd of pedestrians, killing three of them. A further 34 people were injured in the city of Graz. Tens of millions of people are taking part in the first World International Yoga Day today. After a major push by India, 192 of the UN member countries are marking this celebration of the ancient technique to find spiritual calm and physical strength. It seeks to synchronise body, mind and breath and is recognised as having numerous physical and psychological benefits. The word ‘yoga’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘yuj’, which means ‘to unify’. One of the champions of a world yoga day is the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who in the last hour joined thousands of people in Delhi. Let’s get the latest from our reporter, Nitin Srivastava in Delhi. A little bit about what you are seeing. The mood, mood, presumably, it is all fairly calm and serene? The mood here has been very happy for the last two hours. The Prime Minister arrived, and was supposed to deliver a small speech. But he came down from the stage and started walking to the people performing the yoga outside. They started doing it for half-an-hour. There are hundreds of thousands here, who actually arrived here before dawn. It has become something symbolic, it has covered the length and breadth of the country. Officials have been asked to perform, he has managed to create a fever, a frenzy about yoga. This morning, he said it is for the cleansing of mind, body and soul. You alluded to it, it has been criticised, particularly by some Muslim groups who say it is the Prime Minister ‘s attempts to marginalise other non- Hindu cultures. What can you tell us? (INAUDIBLE). I’m not sure if you heard us, but can you tell us more about the criticism lodged at Prime Minister Narendra Modi about this attempt, world yoga day, and attempts to marginalise other non- Hindu cultures? Sorry, we lost the line. Yes, this is something they have been talking a lot about, this subject of exercise, yoga, it is being practised by Hindus. Some religious groups have said it should not be mandatory. There are a few people out there, in the crowd, many of them Muslims who have come here as a show of strength and solidarity for the Prime Minister ‘s movement. It does not affect their religion or their beliefs, they say. It is something that has been happening in India for some time, there’s been a fairamount of India for some time, there’s been a fair amount of criticism. Lakra thanks, apologies for the quality of that line. -- many thanks. The Oscar winning actress Angelina jolie has pleaded for the world to do more for refugees who have been displaced by war or persecution. She made the appeal while visiting the Syrian border for World Refugee Day, highlighting the plight of victims of Islamic State militants. As a UN Refugee Agency special envoy, she called on the UN Security Council to reach a political solution to end conflict there. People are running out of places to run to. If you are Iraqi or Syrian, fleeing violence, where do you go? Every border country is being pushed to its limits. That is why we see so many people dying at sea. It is not a new trend. It is a result of those fleeing country after country, and finding no safe place. These are not economic migrants looking for a better life. These are desperate refugees fleeing war and persecution. The average stay for a refugee in a protracted refugee situation is 25 years. So think of your own life. Think of what that would mean. For many, that is your entire childhood and beyond. A British Army parachutist has escaped unharmed after his chute failed to open during an airshow. His team-mate caught him in mid-air in front of stunned spectators who were watching the Red Devils display team. The two men became entangled before plunging into the water at a marina. A routine stunt which went wrong. This is the moment two Red Devils collided with each other, hundreds of feet above the ground. To the untrained eye, the two men seemed out of control. But years of training and quick thinking saved the day. With one skydiver wrapped in the other’s parachute, the experienced Red Devils guided each other safely into the nearby harbour. I looked up, seen the parachute was a little bit wrapped around, so pretty much straightaway you realise it’s not exactly how we planned to do it. But then the training kicks in. Members of the Parachute Regiment of the British Army, we always train for every eventuality. So then we look at implementing the plan we always have in the back of our minds if something does happen like that. But on the ground, things looked quite serious for a few heart-stopping moments. You could see them wrestling to get control. And in, you know, what has to be an incredible piece of skill. One managed to land over here, about 700 metres from the original drop zone. It was just breathtaking to watch, to be honest. I mean, everyone was expecting a tragedy and these guys pulled it off and it was just incredible. And this is what the spectators at the Whitehaven Air Show were hoping to see. Skydivers from the Parachute Regiment stacked on top of each other in a spectacular display. So will this incident put them off? No, we’ve got a full season ahead of us, what we’ve got to look forward to this year, another 40 displays to do this year, which we’ll hopefully get done with the nice weather. Fortunately, no-one was injured and the Red Devils will be back in action tomorrow. But for now, one para says he owes the other a drink. A pint of beer, maybe, yeah. joe Lynam, BBC News. In sport Lewis Hamilton’s domination of qualifying this season has continued ahead of Sunday’s Austrian Grand Prix, where he’s claimed his seventh pole position in eight outings. Hamilton’s team-mate Nico Rosberg will line up beside him, with Sebastian Vettel in third. Nick Parrott watched the action. To beat Lewis Hamilton in qualifying, you have to push to the limit. But with pole in his sights, Nico Rosberg went beyond that. With the German in the gravel, the Briton enjoyed the last laugh. Up until that point, Hamilton had looked uncomfortable in Austria. The Red Bull Ring punishes mistakes, and Hamilton was struggling not to make them. In the first session, he was more than a second adrift, in 13th place. But he wasn’t as unlikely as some. Kimi Raikkonen was expected to challenge for Ferrari, but found himself 18th. Fortunately for him, penalties for others will see him furtherup the grid. Despite owning this circuit, there were no favours for this man. He failed to make it into the final session for the first time in this season. With his eye on the prize, Hamilton kept chipping away, and the pieces finally fell into place as he leap-frogged Rosberg. But his eagerness to extend his lead by two tenths of a second saw him come a cropper on the final run. That left pole within Rosberg’s grasp, but when it mattered, he couldn’t hold on at the final corner. A small robot, the same size as an eight-year-old child, is the star of a opera performance at Berlin’s Komische Opera. The robot, known as Myon, plays in the performance of ""My Square Lady"". Our correspondent Peter Dobbie explains. This is My Fair Lady with a twist, otherwise known as My Square Lady. A small robot the same size as a primary school child is the star of this performance of Berlin’s Komische Opera. The robot, developed by the Berlin Humboldt University, is known as Myon. He or she, we haven’t been told which, gives it his/her best. Not exactly belting out songs from the shows, but rather trying to learn what it means to be human, what emotions feel like. For us, the robot is a means to look at ourselves as humans, and to ask the question what makes us human. And what differentiates us from a machine, or an object. And empathy and the ability to feel are quite crucial, I think. This performance apparently allows the robot and the audience to experience the same cascade of emotions, in an environment that is totally unique, in a theatre. And it is, they say, that mechanism that guides the process. Emotions decide where to go with the attention, and so there is an attentional frame. Should the robot focus on the object, or does it get boring, and has there been a noise? And so the robot turns to the side. It is the emotional mechanisms which are in place, and guide the process. Spare a thought for Myon, however. He, or she, doesn’t survive the performance. As part of the apparent desire to discover what makes a robot tick, he or she is taken to bits on stage, and passed from cast member to cast member. Those German opera fans really know how to have a good time. Now the Weather with Ben Rich. Hello there. We are now into the early morning of the 21st ofjune. The summer solstice, the longest day. Now the date of this can vary. Some years it is the 20th, some years the 22nd ofjune. But this year the 21st is the day, and with all that extra daylight to enjoy, wouldn’t it be good to have some sunshine to make the most of it? Well there are some sunny spells in the forecast. Some showers too, particularly in northern areas. Generally I think quite a lot of cloud actually on Saturday. From the Midlands southwards we will see some breaks in that cloud, and it should stay largely dry. Further north though, there will be some showers. Across Northern Ireland, we will see some of those through the afternoon. This is 4:00pm. Some sunny spells as well. Quite a cool, fresh feel, 14 degrees in Belfast. Across Scotland, particularly eastern Scotland, some of the showers could be slow-moving and heavy, possibly with some rumbles of thunder. For the far north and the Northern Isles, it is likely to stay quite cloudy through the day, with some persistent rain. Sunshine and showers through northern England. 15 degrees there in Manchester. Come further south, though, through the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east, it looks largely dry, often with large amounts of cloud. You’ll notice a cooler, fresher feel after a humid and muggy Saturday. A rather cooler affair. 16 degrees in Plymouth, a mixture of cloud and some bright spells. A similar story in Wales, maybe the odd shower across the north Wales. As we go through Sunday night, northern areas will continue to see some showers. Some clearer spells too. More cloud throwing itself in across the south, with this belt of rain which is going to try a nudge its way in. Now I have to say, this rain band is associated a really wiggling weather front, that can’t quite make up its mind exactly where it wants to go. So there is a bit of uncertainty about exactly where this wet weather will be on Monday morning. It could well be, though, that southern areas of England see some outbreaks of rain first thing. That then pulling away to the south, to leave actually a decent day for many, with some brightness, some sunshine particularly in the west, some showers continuing in eastern parts until Monday afternoon. Still, with that cool, fresh feel to the weather. 12 degrees in Aberdeen, 17 in Cardiff, 19 in London. Into Tuesday, a lot of dry weather again. A fair amount of cloud, with some spells of sunshine. Frontal systems trying to invade from the Atlantic, so more cloud and perhaps some splashes of rain eventually into Northern Ireland. Now, this flabby area of high pressure is trying to keep charge of our weather. However, this bending frontal system tries to nose its way into the north-west during Wednesday. So for the middle of the week, Northern Ireland and Scotland look like seeing some rain. Further south it should remain largely dry. A service will be held later on Sunday as the church reopens for worship. Police in Austria have arrested a driver who ploughed into a crowd of pedestrians, killing three of them. 34 people were injured in the city of Graz. Local authorities say the man is mentally unbalanced and ruled out any political motive for the attack. Greece has said it will offer further concessions to its creditors in a last-minute attempt to unlock billions of euros desperately needed by the country. Eurozone leaders will gather for an emergency meeting in Brussels on Monday to try to resolve the current stand-off. Now, there are calls for staff working in hospital A&E departments to get specialist training to improve the way they treat patients with dementia. Often, those with the condition find hospitals noisy, stressful and frightening places to be. john Maguire has been to see the pioneering course designed to help both staff and the people they are looking after. A person with dementia may not be able to see your view of the world. These frontline medical staff know how to identify what is wrong with a patient coming into the emergency department. But what if that patient has dementia? One thing you find with people with dementia, is noise. Noise gets you unsettled, and there is a racket, and people moaning, and people shouting, it is... Not just disconcerting, it’s frightening. So this is a picture of a nice bridge. But it is actually an acoustic panel to try and keep the noise down. This is the Dementia Services Development Centre at the University of Stirling. But the thing for the patients is keeping the noise down, making it look a bit more normal, and not so scary. Doctors, nurses and carers from around the world come here to learn more about the condition, and crucially, how to look after people with it. It’s the same for people coming into the accident and emergency. You may be an expert in trauma, and that care and support, but if it’s someone with dementia, you don’t have to be an expert, but you should at least know what’s going on for that person. So they have devised a course specifically designed 'foI’ EITIEFQEFICV tâ8ITIS. Complete night and day, it’s a really big change in nursing behaviour. And this programme is the core to change in nursing practice, and that’s what’s so important about it. Here at Nine Wells Hospital in Dundee, the system is already in place. These senior nurses have used their expertise in order to help other nurses. The nurses who have gone through our learning programme so far have initially said they thought that they knew about dementia. They felt there were confident at caring for people with dementia, but at the end of the course, have actually realised they had quite significant knowledge gaps, and now feel more empowered and able to look after people with that cognitive impairment. We need to look at their nutritional and needs, we need to reduce the amount of staff that go in to see them. We need to stop repeatedly questioning them. You know, we just need to look at the patient as a whole, and really try and streamline their care, and make the journey as smooth as possible. And that is just through communication, with staff members, family, and carers that come in as well. Now the important thing to remember about this course and the training associated with it is that it is designed for emergency department staff. And what is unique about the way that staff work in places like this is of course the sense of urgency. They are always working against the clock. So there is a balance to be struck. The hope now is to roll out this course right across the UK. The ultimate aim, to help patients receive notjust the best clinical treatment, but to be treated better as a person. And now on BBC News, Our World. The US has been fighting a war on drugs for 50 years. America’s public enemy number one is drug abuse. Millions of people, mainly poor and black, have been incarcerated. No country in the world jails their population at the rate the US does. And it is notjust those behind bars that are affected. We have so many people in the US that we are adding to crime by messing up families. Money have fallen foul of America’s draconian drug laws. Many thousands are non-violent, serving up to life for non-violent arrests. I’m sickened by the war on drugs and I’m sickened by what it says about America. But change is happening. The Obama administration has decided to let some out. This film meets one man freed by the President, the family of a woman who hopes Obama will do the same for her... Imagine walking out the door... ..and a casualty of America’s war on drugs, who is finding life on the outside almost as tough as life on the inside. I have been living in a car for over a year. I wanted to go out and kill a bunch of cops because I had no assistance, I don’t know where to turn. Freedom for Israel Torres after seven years behind bars. And into the arms of his mother. Freedom for Israel Torres after 17 years behind bars. And into the arms of his mum. Getting another chance at life. .. Israel regrets his crime and how it hurt those closest to him. Sentenced to life for dealing in a small amount of crack cocaine, he is thankful President Obama’s clemency has given him a second chance. Israel is one of only a handful of people released by President Obama. It is part of an effort to reverse the effects of 50 years of mass incarceration. You have young people who did not engage in violence, who get very long penalties, get placed in prison. Families are devastated. The path that we have taken in the US in the so-called war on drugs has been so heavy in emphasising incarceration that it has been counter-productive. The war on drugs has led to a quadrupling of the prison population since the 1980s. It now stands at 2.2 million. Many of those locked up are disproportionately poor and black. One of the ways the Obama administration aims to get these numbers down is through a new clemency initiative, encouraging inmates like Israel to apply to have their sentences commuted. He asked me if I’d ever tried it and I said no and he gave me an application and said to fill it out and see what happened. Israel gave it a go. To qualify, you must be a non-violent low-level offender without significant ties to large-scale criminal organisations. The guard comes out of his office and yells my name and I look at him and my mouth got stuck. It was like I had seen a ghost. I got the paper and started reading it. It told me I was granted clemency. I got my life back. It was a beautiful day. It says, ""Brother, I can only imagine how you are feeling. ""Please know I feel so happy and such excitement... ""I can’t wait to see you. ""Your sister, Cynthia."" Everybody started calling for their paperwork, trying to get the information that they needed to fill in the form. There’s a whole bunch of people who are in prison that I feel don’t deserve to be doing as much time as they’re doing. The harsh drug laws that led to Israel and thousands like him being locked up were drafted by the lawyer Eric Stirling in the 1980. That is me and this is Mr Hughes, who was the chairman, who wrote these mandatory minimums. It will be on my epitaph. They really came right out of my word processor in Room 207 in the building. The Senate made more harsh what I helped develop for them. They made the quantities lower, especially for crack cocaine, so they swept up more people. Stirling called this probably the greatest tragedy of his professional life. The mandatory minimums had triggers of 5g. Tiny, tiny quantities of crack cocaine. And that ankle-high obstacle became the target for the justice Department. Every year, thousands and thousands of people who had little 50g cases, 50g being the weight of a candy bar, if you had a 50g case, that was a minimum of ten years up to life in prison. Here in Virginia, Congressman Bobby Scott has been campaigning for 30 years to get these drug laws changed. We are locking up so many people in the US that some studies have shown we are actually adding to crime by messing up so many families. We have too many people with felony records and it prevents them from getting jobs. You go to an African-American church and ask how many people have a relative or close friend in prison today and all the hands will go up. When you know somebody who is serving 20 years and they did not really do anything that bad... 20 years - that is what murderers and kidnappers get. If I’m in the Bronx, I go to two or three different areas to see which is safer. It’s nighttime in New York and Amir is looking for somewhere to sleep. There’s a lot of construction in some places, so sometimes I don’t feel comfortable there. I might get stopped by police. One place where I used to sleep at night was in Harlem but they cut all of the trees down and now I’m out in the open, so I don’t feel comfortable staying there. Amir was released from prison four years ago after serving 20 years for a drug offence. The tough time he has had since leaving jail shows the huge obstacles faced by many long-term prisoners on the outside. He has struggled to find a job The majority of my stuff is in the trunk. My blanket... I left my quilt at a friend’s house because it’s not as cold anymore. Most of the year, I have just one light jacket. In winter, I have a very large comforter. And I’m lucky I have an economy car because it costs about $5 or $6 per night to keep the car running so the heat is on. Even though he worked while in prison for 20 years, he is still left with nothing. At the end of my 20 years, they gave me a cheque for 89 cents. I worked all these years and they gave me a cheque for 89 cents? First, it takes $1 to cash a cheque, so it is really not worth the paper it’s written on. Despite hundreds ofjob applications, the sheer length of time Amir spent behind bars puts off most employers. He rarely even gets an interview. If people know that you are homeless, they won’t even give you a job. It has left him having increasingly desperate thoughts. Going to everybody, asking for help, and you keep getting no, you keep getting turned away, not having no assistance... I went politicians and asked them for assistance. I lived in my car for over a year. New York City put a boot on my car. I went to each one of my friends to try and get a gun. I wanted to go out and kill a bunch of cops because I’m having no assistance. I don’t know where to turn. I go to places that are supposed to help people and they can’t help. I see all the money they’re using to incarcerate people but they won’t use a portion of that money to help people. I’m lucky I did not get the gun because if I did, I don’t think I would be here today. Under President Obama, there has been a recognition by the Department ofjustice that the war on drugs has failed and that a more common-sense approach to sentencing is needed. the guidelines as they were. We thought that the penalties were unnecessarily high under We thought that in many ways it was detrimental to public safety. Prison costs a lot of money. It’s also costly in human and community terms and we try to minimise those costs as much as possible, consistent with improving public safety. We thought that reducing the penalties for drug traffickers, in this light way the commission was considering, in recognising there were still significant enhancements for drug traffickers, whether violence, drugs, or involving children, we thought the step would be the right one and help us to improve public safety. The change in sentencing guidelines mean thousands of prisoners could be released in November. It will apply to those offenders who would, if they would have been sentenced today under the new sentencing guidelines, have had a reduced penalty. The commission has estimated that is again roughly in the 30,000-40,000 people. While these new guidelines have given hope to countless families across America, they don’t apply to all drug offenders. Here in Virginia, one family has been torn apart by the war on drugs. Their only answer is the man in the White House. We thank you to be with us, to guide us, and help us in all that we say and do. This is our prayer injesus’s name. ALL: Amen. As with so many other victims of America’s tougher drug laws, it’s not just those behind bars who suffer. With my mother being incarcerated, my biggest fear is that my brother is not gonna care about life. He may go out rob a bank or something, you know, heinous that he wasn’t raised to do, butjust because he has that hate inside him for our legal system. Perry was in his 20s when his mother was stopped for a broken tail light in April, 2006. SHOUTING. The situation quickly spiralled out of control after the officer says he smelt marijuana in her car. SHOUTING. It was a chain of events that resulted in her getting a life sentence, plus 30 years for conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. A crime she denies. The family believes she should have been helped, not locked up. Foryears, honestly, I used to tell her all the time, because my mother was on probation, I would say, call a probation officer and get her violated, because I knew my mother was using. I’d been around it all my life. They would kind of turn a blind eye towards it at times, when she was high. I would say something to her and they’re like, she’s not high, and I’m like, you can’t tell the way she’s talking or something? I knew if she was on probation and if she violated probation she would go to jail. This is not about guilt or innocence. On the one hand she doesn’t have to prove she is innocent, on the other hand she doesn’t have to say, I’m guilty, I’m sorry. What this is all about is that the sentence is unfair. That’s what this is about. Her family and friends are working tirelessly to get the attention of President Obama, the only man who can help. We’ve tried to support her through every stage of the process. We went to the trial, all of the subsequent hearings and so on. We continuously try to get her legal help and to keep her case visible. Really, the only possibility left to help her is presidential commutation. Leaving them behind, you walking out, the door opening and closing... Looking back, I wish I would have done more because it wouldn’t have been so rough. Looking back at that situation, if there were better programmes, offered to her back then, it would have been a lot easier on me and my family. Instead of locking up non-violent drug offenders for life, here in the conservative heartland of Texas they’ve been pioneering a rather different approach. This court in Dallas aims to prevent drug users from ending up injail. The drug court that I preside over is a drug treatment course, for people who have never been arrested for a felony law offence. They get arrested for a schedule one drug which is heroine, cocaine, methamphetamine, something like that. Folks who come into the programme get assessed to see if they’re dependent and what their dependency is. They are sent to treatment initially. They are then monitored closely. They’re not technically on probation and when they finish the programme their case is dismissed and they can get their record expunged. Texas does have a tough on crime reputation. We send a lot of people to death row, relatively speaking compared to the rest of the world, but when it comes to people with drug problems we are probably pretty progressive compared to the rest of the United States. I have a regularjob as a districtjudge. I really do enjoy working in this because I get to see people get out of the system and get their records clean. This path wasn’t available to Israel. He missed out on 17 years of his life, including his brother’s death. He passed away in his sleep. I was like, man, it hurts me to this day because he was my other half. He was two years older than me. He left a little boy and a little girl. Now, I mean, they’re my responsibility. I’ve got to step in and take his place. Today he is meeting his nephew for the first time. What you doing? Come here. What’s your name? I asked if I could go to the funeral but they denied me, saying I would have to pay for all of the expenses myself and they gave me some outrageous number on how much I would have to pay for them to take me. So Ijust... I mean, I wouldn’t have been able to afford it if I wanted to. I had a life sentence, so it’s like I was dead too. It was like I had a disease that couldn’t be cured. There was no cure of for it. Finally one day there was a cure and now I’m here. I just want to catch up with my family and, like I said, build a strong foundation, bring them back together and move on with them and show them the person that I’ve become. After four years of struggle, Amir is beginning to turn his life around. He’s finally working again, helping the homeless at night at the YMCA in Harlem. I hide my homelessness because it’s from 3pm until 11am. In the daytime I get to go to somebody’s house, take a shower, whatever. But the ironic part is I’m a case manager helping individuals who are homeless. When I go in there I talk to a lot of individuals who are homeless. Some might have a job and they need direction. It’s ironic how I can give these guys direction, I can help, a lot of them are like, yo, A, there’s something different about you. Why are you different from everybody else? I can tell them that I know what it feels like to be homeless and I tell them for almost two years I’ve been homeless myself. When I tell them that, then they give me more respect and listen to the words that I say. For this mother, her prison torment continues. We’re going to do our very best to make this case visible because we think it’s exemplary of things that a lot of people are talking about, the drug war. On Capitol Hill, the new rules on sentencing have been broadly welcomed by both Democrats and Republicans. A realisation that the US cannot simplyjail its way out off a drug problem. Why are we wasting so many lives? So many lives are thrown away. There are thousands, tens of thousands of people who the president could reduce their sentence. There are so many people who should be let out now. I’m sickened by the war on drugs and sickened about what it says about America. Hello there. We are now into the early morning of the 21st ofjune. The summer solstice, the longest day. Now the date of this can vary. Some years it is the 20th, some years the 22nd ofjune. But this year the 21st is the day, and with all that extra daylight to enjoy, wouldn’t it be good to have some sunshine to make the most of it? Well there are some sunny spells in the forecast. Some showers too, particularly in northern areas. Generally I think quite a lot of cloud actually on Saturday. From the Midlands southwards we will see some breaks in that cloud, and it should stay largely dry. Further north though, there will be some showers. Across Northern Ireland, we will see some of those through the afternoon. This is 4:00pm. Some sunny spells as well. Quite a cool, fresh feel, 14 degrees in Belfast. Across Scotland, particularly eastern Scotland, some of the showers could be slow-moving and heavy, possibly with some rumbles of thunder. For the far north and the Northern Isles, it is likely to stay quite cloudy through the day, with some persistent rain. Sunshine and showers through northern England. 15 degrees there in Manchester. Come further south, though, through the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east, it looks largely dry, often with large amounts of cloud. You’ll notice a cooler, fresher feel after a humid and muggy Saturday. A rather cooler affair. 16 degrees in Plymouth, a mixture of cloud and some bright spells. A similar story in Wales, maybe the odd shower across the north Wales. As we go through Sunday night, northern areas will continue to see some showers. Some clearer spells too. More cloud throwing itself in across the south, with this belt of rain which is going to try a nudge its way in. Now I have to say, this rain band is associated a really wiggling weather front, that can’t quite make up its mind exactly where it wants to go. So there is a bit of uncertainty about exactly where this wet weather will be on Monday morning. It could well be, though, that southern areas of England see some outbreaks of rain first thing. That then pulling away to the south, to leave actually a decent day for many, with some brightness, some sunshine particularly in the west, some showers continuing in eastern parts until Monday afternoon. Still, with that cool, fresh feel to the weather. 12 degrees in Aberdeen, 17 in Cardiff, 19 in London. Into Tuesday, a lot of dry weather again.

Millions take part in the first International Yoga Day. 35,000 people gather in the Indian capital, Delhi. Hello. Welcome to BBC News. Chilling images have emerged online that appear to show a gunman accused of killing nine African Americans at a US church, burning the American flag. Dylann Roof appears holding weapons and posing with a Confederate flag, a symbol used during the civil war by southern US states opposed to the abolition of slavery. Thousands of people have been protesting in South Carolina’s capital Columbia against the Confederate flag that flies on the grounds of the state house. But those calling for its removal say the banner is an inappropriate symbol because of its racist associations, and particularly insensitive after wednesday’s masacre. Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from Charleston. New images of Dylann Roof paint a chilling picture of the 21-year-old. These images show him at sites in and around Charleston, associated with this area’s history of slavery, and its divided racial past. Roof’s friends showed me around the trailer, a few hours from Charleston, where he had been staying in the run-up to the shooting. They told me he had talked about attacking the university the week before. But they never believed he would go through with it. He told me that the Church wasn’t his primary target at all. That’s why my heart goes out to those nine families, because you guys weren’t the targets. What does that mean? He wanted to shoot the school up, UCA, the University of Charleston. He just stopped talking about it, he said they will have seven days to live. A week later, charged with nine counts of murder, Roof appeared before a judge via videolink. He is now in solitary confinement as he awaits trial. Tonight, floral tributes continue to grow outside the church. But some things remain untouched, like this sign, advertising Sunday service led by the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, one of the victims. Tomorrow, the church will reopen for a small private service in honour of those who lost their lives. A peace deal has been signed in Mali aimed at ending decades of conflict between the government and ethnic Tuareg rebels, The government has agreed more regional autonomy for the Tuareg and has dropped arrest warrants for their leaders. An international force is still struggling to contain jihadist and other armed groups active in northern Mali. just four months ago, these separatist rebels were trying to take this town in northern Mali. It is a country where ethnic divisions run deep. The Tuaregs and Arabs in the North feel victimised by the black Arab government in the south. Their fight for greater autonomy has fuelled a conflict which has lasted decades. But now the Malian government has reached a peace deal with the alliance of rebels. TRANSLATION: The implementation of this deal will open new perspectives for development, not only in the northern regions, but all regions of Mali. It will allow us to better manage security questions. By that he means they can now focus on tackling the Islamist militants linked to Al Qaeda, who have taken advantage of the instability. A representative from the separatist rebels signed the peace deal. It does not grant full independence to the north, but does give them greater powers and the regional security force. TRANSLATION: We are very happy to be present today, to sign the peace and reconciliation deal in Mali. Peaceis a very precious commodity that the whole world is searching for. It is today indispensable in Mali in general, but particularly in the region of Azawad. Azawad is what the separatists call northern Mali. Critics of this peace deal say it fails to achieve justice for the victims of the violence, and their families. And all will now wait to see if it really does bring to an end decades of fighting. At least three people have been killed and dozens injured after a man drove his car car at high speed into a crowded square in Austria’s second largest city of Graz. The driver has been arrested. Authorities say the man is mentally unbalanced and ruled out any political motive for the attack. Grainne Harrington reports. By the time emergency services arrived at the main square in Graz, it was too late. Three people were dead and dozens more injured, including several children. Witnesses said the car was travelling at about 100 kilometres per hour, when the driver rammed it straight through a crowded pedestrian zone in the hub of the old city as families were shopping on a sunny Saturday. He then got out of the car and stabbed two people, before he was finally arrested, leaving a trail of bodies on the road. TRANSLATION: All of a sudden, police were pulling a man out of the car. People were calling from the main square, crying, ""call the ambulance. Call the ambulance. There are people were on the street, bleeding."" Then I saw them, one after the other. Luckily, a lot of doctors seem to be around. It’s unbelievable. I tried to leave, but it was hard, because there were people lying everywhere. As victims were taken to local hospitals, more details emerged about the driver. The 26-year-old father of two was under a restraining order, since his wife had accused him of domestic violence last month. Detectives said he handed him self over without resistance, after stopping his rampage near a police station. In other news, police in New Orleans are searching for the killer of police officer Daryle Holloway after he was shot while transporting a suspect to prison. The officer was found fatally wounded in his police car, which had crashed into a utility pole. A suspect he had been transporting was missing from the vehicle, and is the focus for the manhunt.

Athens has said it will offer further concessions to its creditors in a last-minute attempt to unlock billions of euros desperately needed by the country. The announcement comes ahead of an emergency EU summit on Monday. As Greece teeters on the edge, our correspondent james Reynolds reports on the mood amongst its people. The safest assets in Greece may also be its most unaffordable. It is 55,000 euro for this. Celia Xanthopoulos’s family has run thisjewellery shop for four generations. She has learned how to negotiate for a deal. She fears that her government has not. I wouldn’t do it like this. You wouldn’t do it? No, I would like to be more safe, more, you know... More stability? Stability, yes. I don’t like to gamble, and to be so tough. ""Safety first"" works for many other Greeks as well. This week account holders have withdrawn several billion euros from the country’s banks. The cash withdrawals are dramatic, and the warnings about leaving the euro are now increasingly real. But Greece has still found a way of getting on with normal life. After half a decade living with constant crisis, this country has developed a certain apocalypse fatigue. So where better to take a short break? This lunchtime, this beach south of Athens was full. The sun may have influenced the mood. TRANSLATION: I don’t worry, because everything will work out, as always. We’re optimistic. Greece always makes it. This country now awaits emergency talks in Brussels on Monday. Greece suggests that it may be ready to give way a bit. It needs a deal and a rescue. james Reynolds, BBC News, Athens. Tens of thousands of people have taken part in anti-austerity marches in cities across the UK. The largest protest was in London, where figures including the Labour leadership candidate jeremy Corbyn and the singer Charlotte Church told a crowd that they opposed further government spending cuts. Tom Symonds reports. They filled the streets, from the Bank of England, the city’s financial heart, towards Westminster, the centre of political power. The police no longer estimate protest numbers. The organisers claimed 250,000. Some had to queue up to march. There were thousands of placards, thousands of opinions, and one key demand - an end to austerity. We have to balance our books, but at the detriment of the people, no. There’s got to be some way around it. We’re here to support people who are disabled, and deaf people, we want equal rights. That’s why we’re here today. I think a lot of people have given up. It’s not that they want austerity, it’s that they’ve given up fighting it. This is the largest protest since the election result, with austerity very much part of the campaign. People are here for a variety of reasons, many of them public-sector workers. But they say that this is a battle against austerity that will go on for a generation. Austerity is not the only option. It’s unnecessary, it’s unethical, and we’re not going to have it. A watching supporter of austerity didn’t doubt what he called the earnestness of the protesters, but... The honest truth is we need to crack on with it. We’re still spending £75 billion a year more than we bring in. just yesterday, new figures had us at more than £1.5 trillion in debt. CROWD: Revolution! Revolution! Some came in black, masked and with fireworks. At one point, they broke away from the main march and tried to block roads, but policing was light, there was little trouble. Protesters accepted that however well-supported, marches rarely change policies. But they promised there will be more. Tom Symonds, BBC News, Westminster. Now, a British Army parachutist has escaped unharmed after his chute failed to open during an air show. His team-mate caught him in midair in front of stunned spectators who were watching the Red Devils display team. The two men became entangled before plunging into the water at a marina. A routine stunt which went wrong. This is the moment two Red Devils collided with each other hundreds of feet above the ground. To the untrained eye, the two men seemed out of control. But years of training and quick thinking saved the day, with one skydiver wrapped in the other’s parachute. The experienced Red Devils guided each other safely into the nearby harbour. I looked up, seen the parachute was a little bit wrapped around and straightaway you realise it’s not exactly how we planned to do it. But then training kicks in. We’re members of the Parachute Regiment of the British Army and we implement a mind that we always have in the back of our minds if something like that happens. On the ground, things looked quite serious for a few heart-stopping moments. You could see them wrestling to get control. In what has to be an incredible piece of skill, they managed to land over here, about 700 metres from the original drop zone. It was breathtaking to watch. Everyone was expecting a tragedy and these guys pulled it off and it was just incredible. And this is what the spectators at the Whitehaven Air Show were hoping to see, skydivers from the Parachute Regiment stacked on top of each other in a spectacular display. Will this incident put them off? No, we’ve got a full season ahead of us. We have another 40 displays to do this year, which we’ll hopefully get done with the nice weather. Fortunately, no-one was injured and the Red Devils will be back in action for tomorrow. But for now, one Para says he owes the other a drink. A pint of beer maybe, yeah. Stay with us on BBC News.

Tuareg rebels in Mali have signed a peace deal intended to end decades of conflict with the government. BBC News has learned that the British man killed fighting for the terrorist group Al Shabab in Kenya was one of the leaders of an attack on a military base. Thomas Evans, from High Wycombe, was the group’s cameraman, and filmed the raid in which he died. Our East Africa correspondent Karen Allen reports. Apparently pictured in this Al-Shabab video, Thomas Evans, the British fighter, in hisjungle hideout. These images capture him before he was killed in a thwarted attack on Sunday. But we now know he spent time on the other side of the lens. He was Al-Shabab’s cameraman, filming and firing his weapon until the moment he died. He was commanding, ""shoot this one, don’t use a firearm, slaughter this one."" He was ordering. On the material day, the video was on. The film was on his body taking any movement and action, and the shooting of soldiers. The grim task of identifying bodies underway. Thomas Evans was among 11 Al-Shabab fighters killed as they tried to storm a military base. The Briton was said to be the second-in-command. That camera and Thomas Evans’ high-calibre machine-gun are now in the hands of the intelligence services, as investigators try to build up a profile of Britain’s first-ever Al-Shabab fighter to be killed here in Kenya. They will want to know whether he had contact with other foreign fighters, where his networks were, and who he took orders from. Police here suspect Thomas Evans had actually struck before, after he slipped into Kenya unnoticed last year. This is the aftermath of an Al-Shabab killing spree in which more than 70 people died. Survivors described seeing a light-skinned man among the gunmen. This local barber caught a glimpse of him, metres away from a rooftop. This guy was standing close to a pick-up. There was a pick-up behind. He was standing behind that. He had a gun on his back. But he has this, do you call it a laptop? He had a laptop. He had not even covered his hair. What colour was his hair? Let me say brown, like your hair. Thomas Evans may be the first British Al-Shabab fighter to be killed in Kenya. But with about 100 other known recruits, it is feared he won’t be the last. Karen Allen, BBC News, Northern Kenya. The Oscar winning actress Angelina jolie has pleaded for the world to do more for refugees who have been displaced by war or persecution. She made the appeal while visiting the Syrian border for World Refugee Day, highlighting the plight of victims of Islamic State militants. As a UN Refugee Agency special envoy, she called on the UN Security Council to reach a political solution to end conflict there. People are running out of places to run to. If you are Iraqi or Syrian, fleeing violence, where do you go? Every border country is being pushed to its limits. That is why we see so many people dying at sea. It is not a new trend. It is a result of those fleeing country after country, and finding no safe place. These are not economic migrants looking for a better life. These are desperate refugees fleeing war and persecution. The average stay for a refugee in a protracted refugee situation is 25 years. So think of your own life. Think of what that would mean. For many, that is your entire childhood and beyond. Saudi Arabia has warned its citizens not to read or distribute documents that might be faked in an apparent response to the release by Wikileaks of a huge batch of Saudi diplomatic cables. More than 60,000 have so far been made public. Wikileaks says the cables reveal how the Saudis have used their political and financial power to try to control the Arab media. The BBC’s Sebastian Usher explains. We are seeing a confirmation of a pattern, that the Saudis exert a lot of influence behind the scenes. This is the point that Wikileaks is trying to make in its press release, that essentially these cables should show how the Saudis have tried to control the Arab media through different strategies. Through essentially paying them off. If these cables are genuine, which we have been able to verify some of them but obviously there are tens of thousands, there is some evidence, more concrete than perhaps we have had before, of this. One strategy is to buy up subscriptions of newspapers and magazines to support them, and there is a cable that gives information about this across the Arab world. I don’t think this is anything new to people watching Saudi Arabia. Tens of millions of people are taking part in the first World International Yoga Day. 192 UN member countries are marking this celebration of the ancient technique to find spiritual calm and physical strength. It seeks to synchronise body, mind and breath and is recognised as having numerous physical and psychological benefits. The word ‘yoga’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘yuj’, which means ‘to unify’. In Delhi the Indian government lead the celebration of Yoga. Tens of thousands of people on the Rajpath, Kings Avenue, in the heart of the capital- joined the Prime Minister. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a yoga practitioner, he addressed the crowds, and did some moves himself. It was Mr Modi’s plan to get 35,000 people to perform yoga for 35 minutes to set a new Guinness World Record for the largest yoga class at a single venue. However, there has been some criticism that the government is trying to use the event to promote its own agenda. Members of India’s minority groups say it is a ploy to marginalize the country’s Muslims. In Taiwan, the gathering has been dubbed a ""yogathon"". Students, teachers and residents near Taiwan University Stadium in the capital Taipei took part in the international event. The participants performed what is known as 108 rounds of the Sun Salutation, the sequence of yoga poses often practiced at the beginning of a routine as the sun rises. In Malaysia, hundreds of people have already been taking part in Kuala Lumpur. The country prides itself on offering beginners a chance to learn the art and for the more experienced to learn advanced techniques. It also has a significant sector of the economy dedicated to workshops and retreats for tourists seeking an alternative to the usual holiday attractions. A small robot, the same size as an eight-year-old child, is the star of a opera performance at Berlin’s Komische Opera. The robot, known as Myon, plays in the performance of ""My Square Lady"". Our correspondent Peter Dobbie explains. This is My Fair Lady with a twist, otherwise known as My Square Lady. A small robot the same size as a primary school child is the star of this performance of Berlin’s Komische Opera. The robot, developed by the Berlin Humboldt University, is known as Myon. He or she, we haven’t been told which, gives it his/her best. Not exactly belting out songs from the shows, but rather trying to learn what it means to be human, what emotions feel like. For us, the robot is a means to look at ourselves as humans, and to ask the question what makes us human. And what differentiates us from a machine, or an object. And empathy and the ability to feel are quite crucial, I think. This performance apparently allows the robot and the audience to experience the same cascade of emotions, in an environment that is totally unique, in a theatre. And it is, they say, that mechanism that guides the process. Emotions decide where to go with the attention, and so there is an attentional frame. Should the robot focus on the object, or does it get boring, and has there been a noise? And so the robot turns to the side. It is the emotional mechanisms which are in place, and guide the process. Spare a thought for Myon, however. He, or she, doesn’t survive the performance. As part of the apparent desire to discover what makes a robot tick, he or she is taken to bits on stage, and passed from cast member to cast member. Those German opera fans really know how to have a good time. Finally, we can leave you with live pictures of south-west England, Stonehenge, people have gathered to witness the summer solstice, which is the longest day of the year. The sun isjust peeking out, and is due to rise in about 15 minutes. Hello there. We are now into the early morning of the 21st ofjune. The summer solstice, the longest day.

Frontal systems trying to invade from the Atlantic, so more cloud and perhaps some splashes of rain eventually into Northern Ireland. Now, this flabby area of high pressure is trying to keep charge of our weather. However, this bending frontal system tries to nose its way into the north-west during Wednesday. So for the middle of the week, Northern Ireland and Scotland look like seeing some rain. Further south it should remain largely dry. The latest headlines from BBC News. I’m Sharanjit Leyl.

If you love your video games, this is the place to be. This is £3 in Los Angeles. Sorry about the noise - I did ask them to turn it down, but apparently I’ve got to, ""Get lost, grandpa!"" This is where the new games and the new hardware are announced, and for that it’s customary to make as much of a hullabaloo as possible. Some people think the games industry is childish and gimmicky, but they’re clearly wrong. It’s big business, earning billions of dollars and constantly pushing technology to its limits, and every few years driving new technology into existence, too. Take virtual reality, the biggest news once again at this year’s show. We now have a final release version of Oculus Rift, complete with Touch controllers, seen here giving Richard Taylor a tonne of fun. HTC has teamed up with Valve to make Vive, and Sony has Morpheus. So, there are plenty of headsets about, but what are we going to play on them? Well, Marc Cieslak has been to the Matrix. You’ve met the Lawnmower Man! What can I expect to see in these? It’s a good question, Spen. Goggles on! just taking existing videogame genres like first-person shooters or platformers and trying to shoehorn them into experiences which will play on virtual-reality headsets doesn’t always work out that well. Watch out for fire-breathing zombies! If VR is going to make it to the next level... ..developers have to design bespoke experiences for VR-goggled gamers. Which is exactly what we found here on the floor at £3. Ubisoft’s teams are experimenting with themepark-style rides with chairs that move and rumble in time with the action in the headset, as well as a very early prototype of a game which allows the player to soar like an eagle. The fact they can see around in 360 degrees forces you to think about the liberty of looking around, and what does it mean for a game experience. We are treating VR as its own little beast, with its own pros and cons, or you are not going to have a valuable experience, it’s going to be trivial, a little bit what people experienced with 3D television. But as most of the major headsets aren’t slated for release until early 2016, developers like Sony’s London Studios have an opportunity to experiment with its games for Morpheus. What are you looking at? You’ve got some stones, looking me in the eye! What’s interesting about this is the branching gameplay here. Wherever I look will affect how this guy reacts towards me. If I look to the exit sign... GUNSHOT. He’s shot it away. It’s your lucky day! He wants to talk to you. Stand up. So, this is where the Move controllers come in. I pull the controller out of my pocket and I can see my hand. Let’s see if I can take the mobile phone off him. I grab the telephone. I understand we have a little problem. OK, so now I’m on a heist. I can interact with things on the table, so switch the light on and off. What’s in these drawers? I can open the drawers up byjust using the trigger on the controller. Ah! Find a gun, he’s bound to keep one lying about somewhere. If anyone comes in, just dump that on the desk. There’s a guard here, so by kneeling down, I can avoid his gaze. Bingo! ALARM SOUNDS. What are you playing at down there?! You remember the plan? Get Serena, go home! I think I’m going to have to shoot my way out of here. I’m out of ammo, got to reload quickly! LAUGHS. Right, I actually tried to lean on the table there! I think this is as close to starring in an action film as I’ll ever get. I’ve got the diamond, I’ve got the gun, game over. We firmly believe you should build the experiences from the ground up because the 360 degrees gameplay is unique, and if you are restricted to traditional gameplay, you won’t get the best out of virtual reality by taking that route. And if VR is going to thrive, it’s notjust about playing games. Social media and movies are likely to be the next targets of this technology. I think it is a very brand-new medium, I think it will take time for... First, I think the wave will be people working out what game or interactive experiences are going to be in VR. I also think that there’s a potential for linear content but it’ll require a whole new form of storytelling for this kind of immersion in a story. So, VR is here to stay - Ijust wish the headsets didn’t look quite so like welding goggles from Tron. That was Marc, then. Meanwhile, I’m going for a walk on the wild side. Don’t touch the mushrooms! One of the problems I have with VR is that although you’re supposed to feel like you’re there, moving about is usually done with a controller, which breaks the illusion. So, I’ve strapped myself into the Cyberith Virtualizer, which can tell which way your body is facing, whether you are crouching orjumping, and most importantly, where you are walking. Providing your shoes or your socks are slippy enough, these six tiny sensors in the floor will detect the movement of your feet and your in-game character will move in the same direction. And it does feel somewhat realistic. Somewhat. OK, that was exhausting. It feels like you’re walking through treacle with these things on your shoes, but to be fair, if they got rid of any more friction, I’d probably properly slip up. Secondly, I’m getting a case of what I’m going to call the Oculus sweats, which is motion sickness, and that is a problem with VR. What you see with your eyes really has to match what your body feels like it’s doing. For me, if there is a slight discrepancy, I start to get a bit bilious. And this does a pretty good job, especially seeing as you’re walking, as well as moving your head around, but when you go down steps, when you go up and down in the game, of course, this doesn’t replicate that, and I think that is where I was getting a bit of the heave-hos if you know what I mean. It is quite big, so I hope you’ve got the space for it. And it’s pre-ordering for 1500 euros, so I hope you’ve got the money for it. At the moment, they are retrofitting old games to work with this. So far, there are no new games that have been written for the Virtualizer. So, on that note, I’m going to take a walk. I’m going now. As a gamer, I am really excited about the possibilities for virtual reality, but viewer Simon wanted to know what is available right now to buy. Well, there’s a range of different things that you can go for. You can get your first taste of VR headsets with just a piece of cardboard, some lenses and a smartphone. Now, you could totally DIY this yourself, but version two comes partially assembled and it’s got really nice lenses, and you just pop your smartphone into the front there and it allows you to hold it up to your face and view apps. The things that are going to make a difference in terms of quality when you are considering one of these headsets is the better quality lens, the clearer the picture, and also the bigger the lens, you’re going to get less fishbowling. From the same people, a little bit further up in terms of price, the EVA model has got a really nice kind of foam construction. Again, this has got the smaller lenses, so you’ve not got quite such a good, clear picture with this one. The other thing that is going to affect your viewing pleasure is whether or not you can see any outside light. Again, it’s a nice low-cost cardboard one. They allow you to completely encase your face, so you get a much more immersive experience. If you don’t want a DIY cardboard version, there are a range of different devices going up the scale. Now, this is a very inexpensive plastic headset. It comes assembled, it’s got lenses in there, and you pop your phone on the front. This was only £29.95, which seems like a really good value choice, but I couldn’t for the life of me get the point of focus on this. Getting my phone into this annoying clasp was really quite difficult. If you’re going to go the plastic fantastic route, I suggest you put a bit more money into the pot and go for one of these more serious headsets. Now, this VR1 is excellent value for money - it’s under £100 and it comes with trays that you basically slip your phone into. Compatible with the iPhone 6, they also have a tray for a Samsung Galaxy S5. It slips into the side, over the head straps, so you don’t have to hold it on, and it’s a nice and soft foam surround, giving you a very immersive experience. Finally, right up to the top of the range, this is the Samsung Gear. Now, this one only works specifically with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or the S6. You can actually plug it in and then use the controller on the side that allows you to control the apps inside. With this nice big high-resolution screen, the better the image you’re going to get. All of these devices, really, they are going to give you a great flavour of what is available, but they are not as clear and crisp as the dedicated viewers that we’re going to see coming out in the first quarter of next year. What it’s going to be down to whether or not you enjoy it is what apps you put in them and we’ll be looking at those next week. Hello. This week we are starting with two was South Korea is increasing both in speed and surveillance. The government in South Korea has mandated that anyone under 19 buying a new smartphone must let their parents monitor it with B government-approved At the same time, Korea Telecom is offering a superfast mobile network that lets users download a whole high-def movie in under a minute, with up to 1 gigabit per second speeds. Problems getting across a river? Thought so! Well, why not 3D print your own bridge? Amsterdam is first in line for the DIY treatment but if heavy metal is your thing, you’ll still have to wait a bit. They won’t fire up the machine until 2017. It was also the week the Snapchat boss deleteed all his tweets, YouTube announced a live streaming rival to game-mad Twitch TV, and finally YouTube user Seth Bling has built a programme that has learned how to beat a level in Super Mario World in under 24 hours. Yes, from not even knowing how to press right, he used the neat Marl/O algorithm to eventually get to the end of the level. You are looking at the left-hand square, which shows what the programme can see, the right square is the platforms, black squares are enemies. And on the right, the red and green lines show the computer learning from experience. If only we could all learn from experience! Meanwhile, back at £3, here is another attempt to put more of yourself into the virtual world. In this case, just enough to be able to pick stuff up or, if necessary, take out the aliens! These are the Manus VR gloves, and look, you can see my hands are in the virtual world with me as I use them to shoot these crazyjellyfish dudes that are flying around. So, this works with the Gear VR headset, which you’ll remember, I’m sure, is a phone strapped into a headset. And that means this can use the phone’s camera to track the green and blue socks that are on my gloves. That is how the headsets knows where my hands are at any time, and then there are flex sensors in each finger and thumb so the system knows what I’m doing with those as well. This is going to be released at the end of this year, apparently. Now all that remains is for somebody to come up with a few games that use A strong showing from PlayStation with the long-awaited third-person game about a boy and his dog-bird-griffin type thing, The Last Guardian, looks like it might finally see the light of day after being teased way back in 2007. This is going to be harder than I thought. The team behind the greatest and brownest shooter around, Killzone, have a new, much more colourful third person actioner which pits humans against animal inspired automata. This is Horizon: Zero Dawn. Come on! And adventurer Nathan Drake made a crowd-pleasing comeback in a gameplay demo of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End. Hold on! Sony might have been shouting from the rooftops, but Nintendo was uncharacteristically low- key with its announcements this year. Ninty doesn’t do press events at £3 anymore, but it does have an online event. On the stream, it showed off a new Starfox game, Starfox Zero, Maro and Luigi’s Paper jam, and Zelda: Triforce Heroes. All likely to keep hard-core Nintendo fans happy, but there was no mention at all of the rumoured new machine dubbed NX. Maybe next year. Hail to the Chief! The Xbox press event kicked off with gameplay from sci-fi shooter Halo 5: Guardians. The Chief is nowjoined by a team of fellow Spartan supersoldiers who face off against a second Spartan team for squad-based, first-person, space shooting shenanigans involving the alien Covenant and the not at all friendly Prometheans. The announcement that Xbox One will now become backwards compatible with old Xbox 360 games... Today I am pleased to announce Xbox One backward compatibility. . . revealed just how much the audience here love their old games. However, a brief glimpse at a new title where players share the world with each otherfrom development legends Rare shivered the audience’s timbers in anticipation of acts of larceny on the high seas in Sea Of Thieves. This is by far the most ambitious game Rare has ever created. It seems Xbox is jumping on the virtual reality bandwagon with the announcement of a tie-up with valve and its Vive VR headset. I don’t think it’s important that we have our own, there is people like Oculus and Valve that have been working on virtual reality for years. And if we can partner with somebody who is already making strides and innovation, it will be a great platform for those companies, I think it’s better, we don’t want to fragment the market. This is as well as support for the Oculus Rift, and it looks like this is part of a plan which uses Windows 10 to stream Xbox One games to VR headsets. The ace up Microsoft’s sleeve was what it is calling its mixed reality headset, the Hololens, and a demo of how it might work with Minecraft. Hololens is a project which has been shrouded in secrecy, so much so that when we got a chance to get hands on with it early in the morning... The more they build this up, the more it better be good. Yeah, exactly! Microsoft wouldn’t let our cameras in. And because Microsoft wouldn’t let us film it, we thought we’d go somewhere altogether more peaceful and describe what we saw. To be honest, I thought what we saw today was what Google Glass should have been all those years ago, a pair of glasses and a small display in the middle of your vision where the graphics appear and hang in the air or stick to the table as you walk around. I was a bit disappointed, though, that it was a really small display. It wasn’t wrap-around, it was just in the middle of your vision. I was also disappointed that we were given a passive demonstration, something that we just watched, as opposed to they showed an interactive Minecraft demo at a press conference yesterday, so it was a bit disappointing that we didn’t get to do that. You didn’t get to do anything, you just watched it. Technically, though, I did think it was brilliant in that there was no lag, walking around these graphics, these holograms, and they stick to where they are supposed to be, absolutely faultless. Yeah, and it’s important to point out that this is an entirely different bit of kit to all the VR stuff that out there, this is an augmented-reality device. It is a computer in a hat as well, it’s a device that stands alone by itself. It’s got a lot of potential, but I don’t think it’s quite ready for consumers just yet. Computer in a hat, Microsoft - if that is not on the box, we’ll be disappointed! It’s interesting that at this year’s £3, we’ve seen a number of companies try to refine the virtual reality experience, just in case you thought the art was in danger of being so last year. Now you can add your hands into the world, you can walk about in the world, and Sumi Das has been to see a company that can not only tell which way you’re facing but also which way you’re looking. FOVE is the first virtual reality headset with eye tracking. Founder Yuko Kojima hit on the idea while working at Sony PlayStation. She found existing gaming worlds to be a bit sterile. It’s very natural, and I am feeling I didn’t connect with the story deeply, so I started to think about how to connect emotionally with the game, and I came up with as idea. This may be the closest I’ll ever get to having a superpower. Using the FOVE headset, I can shoot lasers from my eyes byjust looking at a target. FOVE tracks your pupils using internal cameras, and those small white dots circling each lens. They are infrared LEDs. Your pupil is lit up in infrared light, our system separates the invisible infrared light internally in the headset, so you can see the screen uninterrupted, there’s no cameras or anything in your field of view. The cameras inside there can see your eyes, and we use them for tracking. And how accurate is it? About right now we can get down to much less than 1 degree. Seeing is believing. I thought FOVE’s demo ended too quickly, but it did work well, thanks to the wide quad high-definition screen and low latency. So we can do things like depth of field in real-time, so whenever you look at something, the background is nicely blurred, which is really good if there’s something disruptive, like text, in the background. We reduced the need for head movement, which drastically, well, almost eliminates motion sickness. The final product will be smaller and lighter, weighing about 250g. A future version will even add facial recognition to detect when users are smiling or frowning. I beat my schore! Gaming feels so natural using FOVE, even I got the hang of it. It’s good for somebody who hasn’t gained since Super Mario Bros. But for someone with limited mobility, it’s a powerful game changer, giving this ALS patient a way to communicate, and it lets this young student with muscular dystrophy play piano. We could use head movement to control the timbre of the piano, so if you had your head down, there would be a long sustain, if you had your head up, there would be a shorter sustain. We’ll find out if these $400 headsets strike a chord with gamers when they become available in early 2016. Now, one of the biggest series in video games, Fifa Football, receives an annual update, and we thought we’d catch up with the games who bring the magic on the pixelated pitch to life. Well, that was absolutely powered in, we could show this goal over and over again. Wonderful agility! Great improvisation as we look back on the goal. Feel sorry for the keeper almost. Amazing! Everything we do is entirely unscripted. We always see it these days, two upfront, 4-4-2. just pick up and get into the mood and use your imagination. Well, it’s cheeky in the extreme, isn’t it, to try a chip from there? We have thousands or millions of lines already in the game. We come here and record a bunch of samples, you know, we have different variations for every single sample. They go with the one striker upfront. And at the point of attack, just one lone striker. We will see how the striking option works with just one upfront. We have, for example, gameplay code that can tell us how far a shot missed, you know, the goal, so if it’s just a few inches, it was a very narrow miss, so we have Martin talking about narrow misses and tonnes of samples for that. The headerjust fractionally too high. If think it’s not quite as it would be in football, then we query it ourselves, and obviously sometimes the game is a little bit more specific than perhaps the real thing. Everybody loves to see a volley, and she enjoyed despatching it too. She was gifted an open goal. The top players play it as well, the top footballers play it and get a lot of fun out of it. You know, I guess we are very lucky to be part of something so successful. And from Fifa to farmers, don’t knock it, very successful franchise! There’s room for all sorts of games here at £3. But that is it for us here. Hope you’ve enjoyed it. We are sticking around in California next week, so please dojoin us for that. For now, though, it’s time for me and jesse to moove on. Don’t milk it! Hello there. We are now into the early morning of the 21st ofjune. The summer solstice, the longest day. Now the date of this can vary. Some years it is the 20th, some years the 22nd ofjune. But this year the 21st is the day, and with all that extra daylight to enjoy, wouldn’t it be good to have some sunshine to make the most of it? Well there are some sunny spells in the forecast. Some showers too, particularly in northern areas. Generally I think quite a lot of cloud actually on Saturday. From the Midlands southwards we will see some breaks in that cloud, and it should stay largely dry. Further north though, there will be some showers. Across Northern Ireland, we will see some of those through the afternoon. This is 4:00pm. Some sunny spells as well. Quite a cool, fresh feel, 14 degrees in Belfast. Across Scotland, particularly eastern Scotland, some of the showers could be slow-moving and heavy, possibly with some rumbles of thunder. For the far north and the Northern Isles, it is likely to stay quite cloudy through the day, with some persistent rain. Sunshine and showers through northern England. 15 degrees there in Manchester. Come further south, though, through the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east, it looks largely dry, often with large amounts of cloud. You’ll notice a cooler, fresher feel after a humid and muggy Saturday. A rather cooler affair. 16 degrees in Plymouth, a mixture of cloud and some bright spells. A similar story in Wales, maybe the odd shower across the north Wales. As we go through Sunday night, northern areas will continue to see some showers. Some clearer spells too. More cloud throwing itself in across the south, with this belt of rain which is going to try a nudge its way in. Now I have to say, this rain band is associated a really wiggling weather front, that can’t quite make up its mind exactly where it wants to go. So there is a bit of uncertainty about exactly where this wet weather will be on Monday morning. It could well be, though, that southern areas of England see some outbreaks of rain first thing. That then pulling away to the south, to leave actually a decent day for many, with some brightness, some sunshine particularly in the west, some showers continuing in eastern parts until Monday afternoon. Still, with that cool, fresh feel to the weather. 12 degrees in Aberdeen, 17 in Cardiff, 19 in London. Into Tuesday, a lot of dry weather again. A fair amount of cloud, with some spells of sunshine. Frontal systems trying to invade from the Atlantic, so more cloud and perhaps some splashes of rain eventually into Northern Ireland. Now, this flabby area of high pressure is trying to keep charge of our weather. However, this bending frontal system tries to nose its way into the north-west during Wednesday. So for the middle of the week, Northern Ireland and Scotland look like seeing some rain. Further south it should remain largely dry. Welcome to BBC News - broadcasting at home and around the globe. Our top stories. New pictures emerge of the man charged with shooting dead nine African-Americans at a Bible class in South Carolina. A peace deal is signed in Mali aimed at ending decades of conflict with Tuareg rebels. Greece says it will offer further concessions to its creditors in a last-minute attempt to unlock billions of desperately needed euros. Achieving inner tranquillity - thousands of people around the world observe the first international Yoga Day. Chilling images have emerged online that appear to show the man who’s been charged with murdering nine people at the African-American Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Many of the photographs including this one show Dylann Roof holding the Confederate flag, a symbol of white supremacy used during the American civil war by southern states opposed to the abolition of slavery. The photographs also show 21-year-old Roof burning the US flag. They were found on a website which included a white supremacist manifesto, although it remains unclear whether Dylann Roof wrote it. The FBI says it is investigating the website which has now been taken offline. Crowds have been gathering outside the Emanuel Methodist church to hear pastors from across the US lead prayers. The church is due to reopen on Sunday. Rajini Vaidyanathan reports from Charleston. Floral tribute to the outside of the Methodist Church in Charleston as people pay their respects. Some chose to express their emotions in words. Others hugged in a general outpouring of emotion. We are all equal, no matter what colour we are. Or where we come from all our background. I believe we should forgive the family, offer forgiveness, that is healing. It is starting the healing process. That is a good thing. Nine people died in the racially charged case. For this to take place is very senseless. She was the kind of person, all of them, they only wanted the betterment of all mankind. Photographs have been published showing the subject burning the American flag and posing with the Confederate flag, the symbol used a southern states opposed to the abolition of slavery. The images appear on a website containing 2000 words of racial hatred. Thousands rallied last night outside the South Carolina State house against the flag’s presence, calling it a symbol of hatred, not heritage. I think it is a terrible insult to the black residents of South Carolina. It is a symbol of our inferior citizens and they are not equal. I think it needs to come down. It needs to come down. Start with the State leaders. The police tape has finally been taken away from the annual charge. It reopens today. All nine people will be remembered in a small, private suffers. A peace deal has been signed in Mali aimed at ending decades of conflict between the government and ethnic Tuareg rebels - whose leader embraced the Malian president at the ceremony. The government has agreed more regional autonomy for the Tuareg and has dropped arrest warrants for their leaders. An international force is still struggling to contain jihadist and other armed groups active in northern Mali. just four months ago, these separatist rebels were trying to take this town in northern Mali. It is a country where ethnic divisions run deep. The Tuaregs and Arabs in the North feel victimised by the black Arab government in the south. Their fight for greater autonomy has fuelled a conflict which has lasted decades. But now the Malian government has reached a peace deal with the alliance of rebels. TRANSLATION: The implementation of this deal will open new perspectives for development, not only in the northern regions, but all regions of Mali. It will allow us to better manage security questions. By that he means they can now focus on tackling the Islamist militants linked to Al Qaeda, who have taken advantage of the instability. A representative from the separatist rebels signed the peace deal. It does not grant full independence to the north, but does give them greater powers and the regional security force. TRANSLATION: We are very happy to be present today, to sign the peace and reconciliation deal in Mali. Peaceis a very precious commodity that the whole world is searching for. It is today indispensable in Mali in general, but particularly in the region of Azawad. Azawad is what the separatists call northern Mali. Critics of this peace deal say it fails to achieve justice for the victims of the violence, and their families. And all will now wait to see if it really does bring to an end decades of fighting. At least three people have been killed and dozens injured after a man drove his car at high speed into a crowded square in Austria’s second largest city of Graz. The driver has been arrested. Authorities say the man is mentally unbalanced and ruled out any political motive for the attack. Harrington reports. By the time emergency services arrived at the main square in Graz, it was too late. Three people were dead and dozens more injured, including several children. Witnesses said the car was travelling at about 100 kilometres per hour, when the driver rammed it straight through a crowded pedestrian zone in the hub of the old city as families were shopping on a sunny Saturday. He then got out of the car and stabbed two people, before he was finally arrested, leaving a trail of bodies on the road. TRANSLATION: All of a sudden, police were pulling a man out of the car. People were calling from the main square, crying, ""call the ambulance. Call the ambulance. There are people were on the street, bleeding."" Then I saw them, one after the other. Luckily, a lot of doctors seem to be around. It’s unbelievable. I tried to leave, but it was hard, because there were people lying everywhere. As victims were taken to local hospitals, more details emerged about the driver. The 26-year-old father of two was under a restraining order, since his wife had accused him of domestic violence last month. Detectives said he handed him self over without resistance, after stopping his rampage near a police station. Police in New Orleans are searching for the killer of police officer Daryle Holloway after he was shot while transporting a suspect to prison. The officer was found fatally wounded in his police car which had crashed into a utility pole. The suspect he had been transporting was missing from the vehicle and is the focus for the manhunt. Heavy rains dumped by tropical storm Bill have led to flooding in parts of the US midwest. Police had to rescue drivers from stranded cars in Dayton, Ohio after roads were left submerged. 84 people have died in Mumbai after drinking toxic alcohol- possibly spiked with chemicals. Funerals have been taking place for the victims who were from one of the city’s slums. At least thirty others remain critically ill. Five people have been arrested for distributing the contaminated alcohol and eight police officers have been suspended, accused of letting it be sold in their area. An auction house in Germany has sold several watercolours supposedly painted by Adolf Hitler for almost $450,000. The most expensive of the signed paintings, showing a castle in Bavaria, was bought by an investor in China for more than $110,000. More now on the situation in Greece. Athens has said it will offer further concessions to its creditors in a last-minute attempt to unlock billions of euros More now on the situation in Greece. Athens has said it will offer further concessions to its creditors in a last-minute attempt to unlock billions of euros desperately needed by the country. The announcement comes ahead of an emergency EU summit on Monday. As Greece teeters on the edge, our correspondent james Reynolds reports on the mood amongst its people. The safest assets in Greece may also be its most unaffordable. It is 55,000 euro for this. Celia Xanthopoulos’s family has run thisjewellery shop for four generations. She has learned how to negotiate for a deal. She fears that her government has not. I wouldn’t do it like this. You wouldn’t do it? No, I would like to be more safe, more, you know... More stability? Stability, yes. I don’t like to gamble, and to be so tough. ""Safety first"" works for many other Greeks as well. This week account holders have withdrawn several billion euros from the country’s banks. The cash withdrawals are dramatic, and the warnings about leaving the euro are now increasingly real. But Greece has still found a way of getting on with normal life. After half a decade living with constant crisis, this country has developed a certain apocalypse fatigue. So where better to take a short break? This lunchtime, this beach south of Athens was full. The sun may have influenced the mood. TRANSLATION: I don’t worry, because everything will work out, as always. We’re optimistic. Greece always makes it. This country now awaits emergency talks in Brussels on Monday. Greece suggests that it may be ready to give way a bit. It needs a deal and a rescue. james Reynolds, BBC News, Athens. Tens of thousands of people have taken part in anti-austerity marches in cities across the UK. The largest protest was in London, where figures including the labour leadership candidate jeremy Corbyn and the singer Charlotte Church told a crowd that they opposed further government spending cuts. Tom Symonds reports. They filled the streets, from the Bank of England, the city’s financial heart, towards Westminster, the centre of political power. The police no longer estimate protest numbers. The organisers claimed 250,000. Some had to queue up to march. There were thousands of placards, thousands of opinions, and one key demand - an end to austerity. We have to balance our books, but at the detriment of the people, no. There’s got to be some way around it. We’re here to support people who are disabled, and deaf people, we want equal rights. That’s why we’re here today. I think a lot of people have given up. It’s not that they want austerity, it’s that they’ve given up fighting it. This is the largest protest since the election result, with austerity very much part of the campaign. People are here for a variety of reasons, many of them public-sector workers. But they say that this is a battle against austerity that will go on for a generation. Austerity is not the only option. It’s unnecessary, it’s unethical, and we’re not going to have it. A watching supporter of austerity didn’t doubt what he called the earnestness of the protesters, but... The honest truth is we need to crack on with it. We’re still spending £75 billion a year more than we bring in. just yesterday, new figures had us at more than £1.5 trillion in debt. CROWD: Revolution! Revolution! Some came in black, masked and with fireworks. At one point, they broke away from the main march and tried to block roads, but policing was light, there was little trouble. Protesters accepted that however well-supported, marches rarely change policies. But they promised there will be more. Tom Symonds, BBC News, Westminster. Let Australia what is happening at Stonehenge. Today is the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, the longest day of the year. The sun rose over Stonehenge and around 30,000 people are gathering to watch. It is believed to have been used as an important religious sites by early Britons thousands of years ago. Recent pagan celebrations began in the 20th century. People flocked to stage every year, with thousands marking the solstice of summer and winter. They look like they are having a nice time.

The latest headlines: Thousands of people have protested in South Carolina against the Confederate flag, after the shooting of nine African-Americans at a Bible class in Charleston. Tuareg rebels in Mali have signed a peace deal intended to end decades of conflict with the government. BBC News has learned that the British man killed fighting for the terrorist group Al Shabab in Kenya was one of the leaders of an attack on a military base. Thomas Evans, from High Wycombe, was the group’s cameraman, and filmed the raid in which he died. Apparently pictured in this Al-Shabab video, Thomas Evans, the British fighter, in hisjungle hideout. These images capture him before he was killed in a thwarted attack on Sunday. But we now know he spent time on the other side of the lens. He was Al-Shabab’s cameraman, filming and firing his weapon until the moment he died. He was commanding, ""shoot this one, don’t use a firearm, slaughter this one."" He was ordering. On the material day, the video was on. The film was on his body taking any movement and action, and the shooting of soldiers. The grim task of identifying bodies underway. Thomas Evans was among 11 Al-Shabab fighters killed as they tried to storm a military base. The Briton was said to be the second-in-command. That camera and Thomas Evans’ high-calibre machine-gun are now in the hands of the intelligence services, as investigators try to build up a profile of Britain’s first-ever Al-Shabab fighter to be killed here in Kenya. They will want to know whether he had contact with other foreign fighters, where his networks were, and who he took orders from. Police here suspect Thomas Evans had actually struck before, after he slipped into Kenya unnoticed last year. This is the aftermath of an Al-Shabab killing spree in which more than 70 people died. Survivors described seeing a light-skinned man among the gunmen. This local barber caught a glimpse of him, metres away from a rooftop. This guy was standing close to a pick-up. There was a pick-up behind. He was standing behind that. He had a gun on his back. But he has this, do you call it a laptop? He had a laptop. He had not even covered his hair. What colour was his hair? Let me say brown, like your hair. Thomas Evans may be the first British Al-Shabab fighter to be killed in Kenya. But with about 100 other known recruits, it is feared he won’t be the last. Karen Allen, BBC News, Northern Kenya. A British Army parachute has escaped unharmed after his parachute failed to open. He was caught in the dairy front of stunned spectators who were watching his display. -- in midair. They then plunged into the water. A routine stunt which went wrong. This is the moment two Red Devils collided with each other, hundreds of feet above the ground. To the untrained eye, the two men seemed out of control. But years of training and quick thinking saved the day. With one skydiver wrapped in the other’s parachute, the experienced Red Devils guided each other safely into the nearby harbour. I looked up, seen the parachute was a little bit wrapped around, so pretty much straightaway you realise it’s not exactly how we planned to do it. But then the training kicks in. Members of the Parachute Regiment of the British Army, we always train for every eventuality. So then we look at implementing the plan we always have in the back of our minds if something does happen like that. But on the ground, things looked quite serious for a few heart-stopping moments. You could see them wrestling to get control. And in, you know, what has to be an incredible piece of skill. One managed to land over here, about 700 metres from the original drop zone. It was just breathtaking to watch, to be honest. I mean, everyone was expecting a tragedy and these guys pulled it off and it was just incredible. And this is what the spectators at the Whitehaven Air Show were hoping to see. Skydivers from the Parachute Regiment stacked on top of each other in a spectacular display. So will this incident put them off? No, we’ve got a full season ahead of us, what we’ve got to look forward to this year, another 40 displays to do this year, which we’ll hopefully get done with the nice weather. Fortunately, no-one was injured and the Red Devils will be back in action tomorrow. But for now, one para says he owes the other a drink. A pint of beer, maybe, yeah. joe Lynam, BBC News. Tens of millions of people are taking part in the first World International Yoga Day. 192 UN member countries are marking this celebration of the ancient technique. It seeks to synchronise body, mind and breath and is recognised as having numerous physical and psychological benefits. The word ‘yoga’ is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘yuj’, which means ‘to unify’. In Delhi, the Indian government lead the celebrations. Tens of thousands of people lined up on colourful mats along the Rajpath, the Kings Avenue, in the heart of the capital. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a yoga practitioner, joined in. It was his plan to get 35,000 people to perform yoga for 35 minutes to set a new Guinness World Record for the largest yoga class at a single venue. Some Muslim leaders complained that the event marginalised non-Hindus, but others welcomed it, saying yoga was not faith-based. Our correspondent is in Delhi with thousands who went through that yoga routine this morning. India is marking this day in dramatic style. It has gathered together 37,000 people, here on the vast ceremonial lawns outside the Indian Parliament to celebrate what it hopes is a world record yoga session. The biggest yoga session in world history. India has been a great champion of yoga under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is actually performing a session behind me. He has made a Gurkha minister and says he wants it to be a key part of all Indian exercise. It has caused some controversy but this is about promoting and Hindu national agenda, this is something be reject, but they say it is a great tradition that should be celebrated in India and around the world. The Indian government says it is the second greatest contribution to the world India has made, after, it says, the number zero. A small robot, the same size as an eight-year-old child, is the star of a opera performance at Berlin’s Komische Opera. The robot, known as Myon, plays in the performance of My Square Lady. Our correspondent Peter Dobbie explains. This is My Fair Lady with a twist, otherwise known as My Square Lady. A small robot the same size as a primary school child is the star of this performance of Berlin’s Komische Opera. The robot, developed by the Berlin Humboldt University, is known as Myon. He or she, we haven’t been told which, gives it his/her best. Not exactly belting out songs from the shows, but rather trying to learn what it means to be human, what emotions feel like. For us, the robot is a means to look at ourselves as humans, and to ask the question what makes us human. And what differentiates us from a machine, or an object. And empathy and the ability to feel are quite crucial, I think. This performance apparently allows the robot and the audience to experience the same cascade of emotions, in an environment that is totally unique, in a theatre. And it is, they say, that mechanism that guides the process. Emotions decide where to go with the attention, and so there is an attentional frame. Should the robot focus on the object, or does it get boring, and has there been a noise? And so the robot turns to the side. It is the emotional mechanisms which are in place, and guide the process. Spare a thought for Myon, however. He, or she, doesn’t survive the performance. As part of the apparent desire to discover what makes a robot tick, he or she is taken to bits on stage, and passed from cast member to cast member. Those German opera fans really know how to have a good time. Now, how many people can you fit on a surf board? Well, that depends on how big it is. And this one is massive. Measuring in at 12 metres, this board was specially made to attempt to break the record for the most people riding a surf board at once. And as you can see it did the job. 66 people clambered aboard and made it to shore in style, taking the world record at Huntington Beach in California. Another record in Italy, where the world’s longest pizza has been broken. These chefs prepare the mammoth margarita on special trays, using two tons of flour, two tons of Tomita source and two tons of cheese, using a unique oven. -- tomato sauce. It measured over 500 metres. How do you top that? Hello there. We are now into the early morning of the 21st ofjune. The summer solstice, the longest day. Now the date of this can vary. Some years it is the 20th, some years the 22nd ofjune. But this year the 21st is the day, and with all that extra daylight to enjoy, wouldn’t it be good to have some sunshine to make the most of it? Well there are some sunny spells in the forecast. Some showers too, particularly in northern areas. Generally I think quite a lot of cloud actually on Saturday. From the Midlands southwards we will see some breaks in that cloud, and it should stay largely dry. Further north though, there will be some showers. Across Northern Ireland, we will see some of those through the afternoon. This is 4:00pm. Some sunny spells as well. Quite a cool, fresh feel, 14 degrees in Belfast. Across Scotland, particularly eastern Scotland, some of the showers could be slow-moving and heavy, possibly with some rumbles of thunder. For the far north and the Northern Isles, it is likely to stay quite cloudy through the day, with some persistent rain. Sunshine and showers through northern England. 15 degrees there in Manchester. Come further south, though, through the Midlands, East Anglia and the south-east, it looks largely dry, often with large amounts of cloud. You’ll notice a cooler, fresher feel after a humid and muggy Saturday. A rather cooler affair. 16 degrees in Plymouth, a mixture of cloud and some bright spells. A similar story in Wales, maybe the odd shower across the north Wales. As we go through Sunday night, northern areas will continue to see some showers. Some clearer spells too. More cloud throwing itself in across the south, with this belt of rain which is going to try a nudge its way in. Now I have to say, this rain band is associated a really wiggling weather front, that can’t quite make up its mind exactly where it wants to go. So there is a bit of uncertainty about exactly where this wet weather will be on Monday morning. It could well be, though, that southern areas of England see some outbreaks of rain first thing. That then pulling away to the south, to leave actually a decent day for many, with some brightness, some sunshine particularly in the west, some showers continuing in eastern parts until Monday afternoon. Still, with that cool, fresh feel to the weather. 12 degrees in Aberdeen, 17 in Cardiff, 19 in London. Into Tuesday, a lot of dry weather again. A fair amount of cloud, with some spells of sunshine. Frontal systems trying to invade from the Atlantic, so more cloud and perhaps some splashes of rain eventually into Northern Ireland. Now, this flabby area of high pressure is trying to keep charge of our weather. However, this bending frontal system tries to nose its way into the north-west during Wednesday. So for the middle of the week, Northern Ireland and Scotland look like seeing some rain. Further south it should remain largely dry. The latest headlines from BBC News. Several thousand protesters have gathered under the controversial Confederate flag at South Carolina state legislature, a -- demanding it be taken down. The perpetrator of the Charleston massacre has been charged with nine counts of murder. A peace deal has been signed and Mali ending decades of conflict between the government and Tuareg rebels.

Police say they were called to the home after reports a boy had been bitten by a dog. This is three-week-old baby Reggie Young, found badly injured in the early hours of this morning, after being attacked by his family’s pet dog. Police were called to his home in Sunderland shortly after 4:00am. Shocked neighbours have been leaving flowers here all afternoon. They had met the new arrival in their street in recent days. He was a really bonnie little lad. He was a lovely bairn, he was. And what do you make of what happened? It’s a shock. It is, a shock more than anything else. You cannae get over it. Police have spent the day examining the home and garden. The dog involved is described as being a small terrier, which detectives have taken away. This evening, a relative of the family told us the dog was usually kept in a brick outhouse in the back garden at night, and he couldn’t understand why it was in the house. He was too upset to be interviewed, but he also said that as far as he was aware, the dog was always well-behaved around children. The dog is a small terrier type family pet, it was the family pet from the home. So not a dog that you would associate with being a dangerous animal. Family members have briefly visited the home this afternoon as investigations continue. A 30-year-old man understood to be the baby’s father has been arrested and is being questioned by detectives following this shocking death. That is all from me for now. At six o’clock it is Breakfast. But now, Talking Books. Welcome to Talking Books. The Hay Festival is in its 20th year and is renowned for celebrating dreams, dissent and discussion. It’s my very great pleasure to be talking to the Irish fiction laureate, Anne Enright. Thank you very much for coming. It really is my very great pleasure to be hosting this afternoon. It is a special edition of Talking Books. We are here to speak with a very special woman who was catapulted onto the international stage in 2007 when she won the Man Booker Prize. Since then, her rise and rise and rise has been inexorable. Infact, in 2015 she became the very first laureate for fiction in Ireland. They had to create the position. Please give a very warm welcome to Anne Enright. Do you welcome the attention? You said a couple of years ago it changed your world completely, that you were in zoom focus, and it was more alarming than interesting. I was wondering what that would mean. The world changes fast but writers change slowly. Suddenly you are viewed differently but you are exactly the same. A little more gratified perhaps... I had worked for so long that I did everything I was invited to do. I travelled the world and all of that. And then you have to shut the door and look at the wall for a while and it’s the same wall as the last one. Suddenly you meet a lot more of these people, the people who have read your books. It was very much aimed at the readers I had met. It was for women readers. I met legions of fantastic women readers in Australia and America. I wanted to make it something that was not as difficult or agonising as The Gathering had been. Something lighter. This position, what do you get? Do you get a medal? I’m wearing it. It is a very fine medal. It’s an official title, the representative of Irish fiction... Ireland is so woven into you and everything you do and write but you wrote once that Ireland ends up domesticating a writer, too. Suddenly from being domesticated by Ireland to being the face of Ireland - quite a journey. Quite a distinction. Irish writers are very complex in their relationship with the country. No-one expects you to change in that way. No-one expects them to be good or very well-behaved. But they do expect a kind of honesty or integrity as you approach the work. I live in Ireland. A lot of people leave Ireland. My kids and parents are there. And I have the amazing Irish tradition to both work against and use. It’s a nourishing and annoying tradition. Why is it annoying? Because to a large extent over the last 30 years, it has been dominated by male voices. There’s a feeling that you may write something fresh and new, things you might say that have never been said by an Irish woman. That’s interesting. You mentioned The Forgotten Waltz and the sex in it. The mirroring of what was going on in Ireland is strong in that. It’s about an adulterous relationship at a time when you felt Ireland was having something of an adulterous relationship with money. Well, a blissful, hectic spirit of denial, telling ourselves a glorious fiction about money, which was actually about debt. I was looking at boom fiction and the suburban male writers likejohn Updike and Richard Yates. Adultery was a great way in to show a society falling apart. The reason we are talking about Ireland in a contemporary way is because there are some contemporary themes which are very relevant in your book, The Green Road. I wonder if you might introduce us to the Madigan family. Tell us about them. There are four children and they go everywhere in the first half of the book, apart from Constance, who stays at home. She briefly moves to Dublin. They are in the west of Ireland and they go to New York, the developing world, to Dublin, and they have to come home in the second half. It’s very much about exile and return. It’s about separation, disconnection and love. Compassion. It is about compassion. Can we compassionately ask you to read some? You can. This is about the mother. I don’t know whether there is such a thing as an easy Irish mother. I say that as a mother myself. This is the first section of the book, narrated by Hannah, who is 12 years old and who has that gaze of a 12-year-old. Her eldest brother has just declared he will be a priest. It’s 1980. The euphoria of the Pope’s visit is fizzling out. This is Palm Sunday, as you good Catholics will know, the Sunday before Easter Sunday. The parents sat at either end of the table, the children along the sides, girls facing the window, boys facing the room. There was a fire in the grate and the sun shone now and then so it was as warm as winter and as warm as summer for five minutes at a time. They were twice as warm. Dan said, ""I’ve been speaking again with Father Fall."" A dappled kind of day, the clean light caught the drops on the window in all their multiplicity while outside 1,000 baby leaves unfurled against branches black with rain. Inside, their mother had a tissue trapped in the palm of her hand. She lifted it against her forehead. ""Oh, no,"" she said, turning away, and her mouth sagged open so you could see the carrots. ""He says I must ask you to think again that it’s hard for a man who does not have his family behind him. ""It’s a big decision I’m making and I must plead with you not to spoil it with your own feelings and concerns."" Dan spoke as though they were in private or he spoke as though they were in a great hall, but it was a family meal that was not the same as either of these things. You could see their mother had an impulse to rise from the table but could not allow herself. ""He says I’m to ask your forgiveness for the life you had hoped for me and the grandchildren you will not have."" APPLAUSE. It’s such a pleasure to hear you read but it’s a keen reminder of how complicated a character you’ve created here in the mother. One thing I feel is that you are very hesitant to pass judgement. Rosaleen is a bit of a wretch, but somebody I would understand. The book is about separating and leaving and the person that we leave all of our lives is the mother. We leave our mother. You come back home and find the mother as a human being who gave birth to you. Rosaleen in is on the brink of being abandoned. And they are leaving her. Dan hasn’t said he will run away and join the circus but the priesthood. The missions, which is perhaps a tiny bit of a circus itself. And you didn’t come home from the missions. He’s announced he’s going and Rosaleen doesn’t see the difference between herself and her children, so she does not spare them her emotions. She doesn’t respect their right to self-determination. She is right in there, messy and very human. I like not passing judgement. She does things that are wrong... She loves her children differently. So, Dan is the golden boy. When I’m writing, I’m notjudging. I love them all equally. That’s how I’m different from her. I love all my characters. When I’m working on them, I like them all the same. You show us glimpses of them in different times and different places. You rip up the rule book - you really do. It starts off in County Clare in a small village and suddenly we zoom out to Dan, who was meant to be a missionary but is right in the middle of the gay scene in New York. It’s a breathless jumping. I like to juxtapose things radically. And a lot of this story happens in the gaps between those chapters. Dan leaves so thoroughly that for a while he leaves the book. He does not really know who he is, Dan. The next we seem him, he’s at a dinner table in New York and it seems to me that’s what people do - they leave the small places where they were born. Ireland is a good example of a small place. They go and have experiences that they could never have imagined, this adolescent imagination of everywhere else being amazing, and it’s challenging beyond your expectations. Each of the siblings is faced with some kind of reach, some ask. The world throws something their way, as it does, and they either will rise to it or fail to rise. When they come home they’ve got all their stuff, they’re in their early 40s, and all their stuff is catching up with them. I’m of the opinion that after 35 you have to stop blaming your mother. Then you have to sort yourself out. That’s one of the challenges. I’ve been accused of writing the quintessential Irish mother but all of my mothers are different. I don’t think you become quintessential in the labour ward. You don’t go in as you and come out apple pie. The mothers in my recent books are as different as women can be. I enjoy de-iconising them, putting a bit of grit into female characters, working in a bit of personality. The book that links you to motherhood, although is a beautifully woven view, is when you talk about your own experiences. I had to write about motherhood because I was so obsessed about my babies. I thought maybe I could write about them and that would be the solution. I thought when I was pregnant I would never write again, that my creativity would get up and walk away, along with my children. That’s a false idea. So, I wrote urgently about those early days because I realised that I would forget all of this. So, that’s my most personal book. The difficulty had been before that, in the ten or 15 years before that. I had to write about motherhood because I was so obsessed about my babies. I thought maybe I could write about them and that would be the solution. I thought when I was pregnant I would never write again, that my creativity would get up and walk away, along with my children. That’s a false idea. So, I wrote urgently about those early days because I realised that I would forget all of this. So, that’s my most personal book. The difficulty had been before that, in the ten or 15 years before that. That was the transition because you had a very hectic life before writing. I worked in TV and I get questions from journalists asking how terrible it was. I burned out catastrophically, but I didn’t give up then. I gave up a couple of years later to write full-time. I don’t think I could burn out with writing because it has an authenticity to me. I mean, who accuses the media world of being inauthentic? Do your children read your work? I can’t talk about my children because they’ll get back at me. My 14-year-old daughter stopped in the middle of the second chapter because she said it was too gay, even for me. Even for me! Do you thank working in TV for your pacing? Because you don’t hang about. When I worked in TV everything lasted about three and a half minutes and you could tell. So my early work was about fragmentation, juxtaposition and cutting, quick transactions. Scene , SCEFIE , SCEFIE. Do you feel that? Yes and a fearlessness about context. The detour into the media was interesting because I read you wanted to be a writer for a long time. Is it true or fanciful? You were given gifts as children that matched your personality. Tell the story. My siblings, the Enrights, when I was 21 my brother was going to study engineering and had all of these instruments, a calculator that could add and multiply. My sister was a doctor and given a stethoscope and I was given an electric typewriter. Off you go. Have you still got it? No, it died at the University of East Anglia. UEA was an important time, because you were lucky to study under Angela Carter. What was that like? It was wonderful and inspiring. She was very... She said, ""This is fine"". You’re trembling, taking her your yearning little words, and she says ""fine"". What are you going to do with your life? She was engaged and treated you like you were already a writer. The truth of that made me swell. Yes, you are a writer! I said I was going back to Ireland and she said, whatever for? I said, for a man. And she said, oh, all right. Which was worse, a man or Ireland for a writer? What can you do? Anyway, she was completely inspiring and she disturbed the ground in a very interesting way, intellectually. She turned everything around and flipped the coin. She took fairy tales in the bloody chamber and turned beauty into a beast instead of turning the beast into a handsome prince. And it was exciting to be with someone who had that instinct for the disturbance of archetype and what new things can come out of it. You tend to accept early stories as finished and the idea that it’s all up for grabs is wonderful. It’s awful when somebody digs up something you said a long time ago. I’ve said a lot! Even noW, today. This is from an essay in the London review of books on Angela Carter. I have no idea how to live in the world, let alone write about it. The elf who was supposed to write some narrative by the end of the year seemed fragmented. I worked all the time but inspiration did not strike. It sounds like a rough time, when somebody may be filled with self doubt and give up. People sometimes say to me, I’ve been working for a year and the book is terrible, and I say, yeah, a year? Try five. Come back to me in five. It’s important to recognise you come to the desk with this grandiosity. It makes the end of the book fraught. Your whole self is somehow involved, but it’s the words on the page, that’s what the book is, not this huge idea of the self. Because people, I don’t want to sound like I have too many theories, but my theory is that many anxieties and problems you surround yours elves with are simply distractions. -- yourselves. The problem is on the page. And the unbearability is on the page. ""If the children were in that wing of the house"". Why? Even if they were silent. All the unbearability is on the page. A lot of the other stuff you get cranky about. Do you know when you’ve written something that is great and do you recognise it, or do you wait for somebody else to tell you that it’s really great? Great is not something I would say because it sounds too monumental. I know if I’ve written something that has a bit of go to it. Because I bother my husband and say, listen to this. You don’t get too attached to it because it might not work. You might dump it anyway. But that ""listen to this"", I know that it’s cooking, working. Veronica’s description of grief, I might share it with you. I want to know what you were thinking. I’m a trembling mess from hip. This is a terrible heat, a looseness in my innards, that makes me want to dig my fists between my thighs, a confusing feeling somewhere between diarrhoea and sex, a grief that is almost genital. Mmm. Wow. I knew then what was in the deep path of that book. I was quite happy to use that unexpected group of words and to use the word genital. I thought, grand. That’s it. That’s good. Your relationship with your characters are intensely presented on the page. Salman Rushdie once said when he went to bed his characters were in their boxes screaming ""let me out"". Like a haunting. How are you with your people? During The Gathering I came into the kitchen and being slightly annoyed with people and realising it was like the remnants of a dream or a bad dream which you haven’t shaken. I realised it was Veronica who had this emotion and not me. I thought, oh, get rid of her! You are to a small extent inhabited by your characters. I keep them in my care for two or three years. I think about their problems the same way you might think about family or friends. It’s kind of gossiping. Dan is in New York. So you have them in mind. And you... Yeah, I tend them. They don’t claw at me at all, though. One author described his characters as being slaves. They aren’t under my thumb in any way. Please join me in thanking Anne Enright. Thank you. We are now into the early morning of the 21st ofjune. The summer solstice, the longest day. Now the date of this can vary. Some years it is the 20th, some years the 22nd ofjune. But this year the 21st is the day, and with all that extra daylight to enjoy, wouldn’t it be good to have some sunshine to make the most of it? Well there are some sunny spells in the forecast. Some showers too, particularly in northern areas. Generally I think quite a lot of cloud actually on Saturday. From the Midlands southwards we will see some breaks in that cloud, and it should stay largely dry. Further north though, there will be some showers. Across Northern Ireland, we will see some of those through the afternoon. Some sunny spells as well. Further south, through the Midlands, a fair amount of cloud, but it should stay quite dry. Temperatures about 14-20 degrees. Through Sunday night, we keep some showers going, particularly across the northern half. The rain will nudge its way in across parts of the south-west, and I have to say there is some uncertainty about how far north or south this rain band will get. This is the current thinking, that southern areas could well start Monday with some wet weather. That will pull away to the south, then we have brighter skies and sunshine. Some showers, especially in northern and eastern areas. Some of the showers potentially heavy. More sunshine developing further west. 15-19 degrees. Dry weather to come on Tuesday. High pressure in charge. One weather system trying to pull in from the west. That brings rain into Northern Ireland by the end of the day. 18 -21 degrees. These high-pressure tries to keep things drive. Trying to bend in across northern areas into Wednesday. In Northern Ireland and Scotland we will have some rain around mid week. Further south, staying largely dry. ~ Hello this is Breakfast, with Sally Nugent and jon Kay. Vaccines for meningitis are to be rolled out for all newborn babies and some teenagers from the autumn.

The husbands of two of the three sisters who travelled with their children from Bradford to Syria have criticised the police. They’ve accused officers of actively encouraging the women to contact their brother believed to be fighting for Islamic State - without considering the consequences.

In a solicitor’s letter to senior politicians, the husbands claim: They say by allowing the sisters to talk to their brother over Skype and Whatsapp, that police have been: The letter also reveals that Zohra Dawood, whose family lived Zohra Dawood, whose family live here, left a message for her relatives on voice mail after the husband’s appeal, saying the reason they had all gone to Syria was because of the oppressive nature of police surveillance. In response, counterberrorism police say they are doing everything they can to ensure the safe return of these children. Officers completely reject the accusations made in the letter. The reality is everybody believes this family are in Syria and this family are in Syria and the British authorities can do nothing British authorities ran do nothing to get them British authorities can do nothing to get them back. The situation is to get them back. The situation is as was, we are now getting into the as was, we are now getting into the blame game. Church bells have been rung throughout Charleston, South Carolina today in memory of the nine people who were killed in a racially motivated attack on Wednesday. 21 year old Dylann Roof, who has been charged with murder, opened fire in a Bible study class in the historically black church. From Charleston, Aleem Maqbool reports. An historic sanctuary, reopened for the first time since the horrors of the attack within its walls. Hundreds gathered in memory of the six women and three men who had worshipped here, but also lost their lives here. A black cloth covered the chair where Pastor Clemente Pinckney would have sat. And now it’s the time for us to focus on the nine families. We need to be in solidarity and praying forfamilies in our communities around this state, and particularly in Charleston. That determination to overcome the hatred of a gunman apparently motivated by racism was very much on display here. The response to this tragedy has really been led by the extraordinary courage and dignity shown by the families of the victims. They have even said they forgive the man who killed their loved ones. That’s not to say they don’t still want answers, and want things to change. Reverend Waltrina Middleton lost her cousin Depayne in the attack. m: We are fighting for our freedom! She has addressed a protest rally in Charleston. Until we have dedicated dialogue around race and racism in this country, we have a long way to go. i: It is in Jesus It is inJesus name we pray. Today has been about providing comfort, but the days ahead will need more soul-searching, notjust here, but across this country.

The Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, says the European Union must go beyond dealing with the ""symptoms"" of the migrant crisis and tackle its roots in Africa. As well as rescuing people in the Mediterranean, Mr Fallon indicated he wanted to see more intelligence sharing and action to address the problems driving people out of their own countries. We can pool the intelligence we all have as European countries on these trafficking gangs, we can get more information about the routes, we can tackle their financing. And we can use our overseas aid budget, and this is where it should be used, to help stabilise some of these countries and discourage this kind of mass migration from them.

149,BBC1 London,21-jun-2015,BBC News,22:00,20 mins,True,"On the eve of a crucial eurozone summit, Greece says it has new proposals aimed at breaking the deadlock over its debt. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is on his way to Brussels as Greece faces a repayment of more than £1 billion in the next ten days. In Athens tonight, thousands of protestors urge him to stand firm against demands for further spending cuts. We’ll be live in Athens and in Brussels to ask whether the Greek proposals will be enough to satisfy its creditors. Here, police are accused of playing a role in the radicalisation of three Bradford women by encouraging them to contact their brother in Syria. The American church where nine people were shot dead reopens with a special service of remembrance. And Andy Murray proves he’s the King of Queen’s, winning the precursor to Wimbledon for a fourth time. Good evening. Greece’s leaders are heading for Brussels tonight with new proposals aimed at breaking the deadlock over the country’s debt crisis. On the eve of an emergency eurozone summit, anti-austerity protestors have gathered again in Athens, insisting that their government should not agree to further spending cuts. In the next ten days Greece is due to pay the International Monetary Fund more than £1 billion. A default is raising fears of a Greek exit from the euro. From Athens, james Reynolds reports. Tonight the Greek Prime Minister begins a journey which may decide whether or not his country stays in the Euro. Alexis Tsipras, the leader who promises no major cuts, is now taking new proposals to tomorrow’s emergency summit. What do you expect, a press conference while I’m driving? No. His finance minister, Yanis Vanoufakis, takes shelter behind a motorbike helmet. Thousands of left-wing protesters tonight gathered outside Parliament to tell their leaders not to break their promises. Why are you here? Because I want to protest against the measures of austerity. If there is no change, Greece gets no deal. Are you prepared for that? Of course, yes. I don’t think that anybody is prepared for this, but at this position we don’t have another choice to make, that’s what I believe. These protesters still want the government to hold its ground, but refusing to give way won’t get this country the deal that it needs. We don’t yet know what the government’s new proposals may contain, nor how much it may be prepared to give up. The congregation of Saint Catherine’s Church in Athens awaits the government’s decisions. Many of the worshippers at this morning service are retired. They rely on pensions that the government has promised to protect. TRANSLATION: It’s very difficult, because my pension has already been halved. The previous government cut all the additional benefit. I manage with help from my sons, who are abroad. The Papathanasiou family has just come from church. They manage to eat out once a month. 27-year-old Michalis spent two years looking for a job. The family wants the government to compromise. TRANSLATION: I want them to agree. Because in my opinion Greece without the euro is nothing. We are part of Europe and Europe means strength. Demonstrators believe that Greece can find a way to get by without giving in. This country has already managed to stretch its last minute to half a decade. But real deadlines and real choices are now closing in. james Reynolds, BBC News, Athens. Live now to our economics editor Robert Peston in Athens and our Europe editor Katya Adler in Brussels. Katya, what reception can the Greeks expect in Brussels tomorrow? There was a really interesting insight into the minds of those who have been negotiating with Greek officials when the frustrated IMF chief Christine Lagarde said that these talks need adults in the room. Tomorrow the adults arrive in force, orI9 Tomorrow the adults arrive in force, or 19 leaders of the eurozone. There is a real sense of urgency here now. The French president Francois Hollande said everything must done to keep Greece in the eurozone. He summed up the mood, but not quite the facts, because while everyone wants a deal, even if it is a messy, short-term one, they do not want to deal at any price for up those countries who have already been through austerity pain like Greece and Ireland, they can’t afford to have Greece bend the rules. -- and Ireland, they can’t afford to have Greece bend the rules. -- Spain and Ireland. Angela Merkel is under pressure from her taxpayers who say they don’t want to prop up Greece any more, and her normally loyal party, as well. So if there is to be a deal with Greece, it will have to be won without too much obvious compromise. Robert, what’s on offer? What is your sense of how big the 9aP What is your sense of how big the gap is tonight between the Greek government anti-the others? The main cause of the ad -- government anti-the others? The main cause of the ad -- anxiety is the state of the Greek banks. 5 billion euros have been withdrawn by worried depositors and savers in the last week, and Greek banks are only alive because the European Central Bank has put them on life support. Under its rules, the European Central Bank cannot maintain that life-support if there is no realistic prospect of a deal, and that’s why these talks tomorrow are so important. Right now, the people I talk to, officials and regulators last week, are gloomy. Although they are aware that Alexis to press, the Greek Prime Minister, think that these come with reasonable concessions, they are not clear that he is offering enough in the way of welfare cuts and tax rises to satisfy the constituencies that we talked about, the Irish and the Spanish, all of whom are insistent that Greece should not be let off lightly. So tonight, a very anxious city. If the talks go nowhere tomorrow, there is a genuine risk the Greek banks will be put under special measures, that there will be restrictions put on the capital that Greeks can withdraw from those banks, and in many ways, that would represent a powerful symbolic move towards exit from the euro, because that would be a breach of one of the euro’s principle rules. And later in the programme, Katya will be reporting from Spain on how David Cameron’s demands for reform across the EU are likely to be received. The husbands of two of the three sisters who travelled to Syria from Bradford have criticised the police, alleging that they played a role in radicalising the women. They say police actively encouraged the sisters to contact a brother believed to have joined Islamic State without considering the consequences. Annie Savic’s report contains some flashing images. -- Annie Savic’s report contains some flashing images. -- Danny Savage’s report. I love you... It’s nearly a week since the husbands of two of the Dawood sisters pleaded for their wives and children to come home. Now these men are blaming the police for the situation they find themselves in. They claim counterterrorism officers actively encouraged the sisters to keep in contact with this man, their younger brother, Ahmed. He is believed to be fighting in Syria. In a solicitor’s letter to senior politicians, the husbands claim... They say by allowing the sisters to talk to their brother once they had left for Syria... The letter also reveals that Zohra Dawood, whose family live here, left a message for her relatives on voice mail after the husband’s appeal, saying the reason they’d all gone to Syria was because of the oppressive nature of police surveillance. But one expert believes that getting this family to leave Britain for Syria was down to a number of reasons. Radicalisation, by definition is multifaceted, it’s multi dimensional, it’s extremely complex. And for that reason there are a combination of factors which potentially can influence somebody’s decision. In response, counter-terrorism police say they are doing everything they can to find these children and their mothers. And officers completely reject any suggestion that they helped radicalise or groom the adults involved. Danny Savage, BBC News, Bradford. The South Carolina church where nine African-Americans were shot dead four days ago held a service today for the first time since the attack. As the congregation remembered those killed as they attended a Bible study class, hundreds of other people gathered outside. Let’s join our correspondent Aleem Maqbool, who’s there now. Aleem. It was an incredibly moving day in Charleston. Bells rang out in churches across the city in member and its -- churches across the city in member and its -- remembrance of the nine people killed here. The service was focused on the community and on trying to heal. An historic sanctuary, reopened for the first time since the horrors of the attack within its walls. Hundreds gathered in memory of the six women and three men who had worshipped here, but also lost their lives here. A black cloth covered the chair where Pastor Clementa Pinckney would have sat. And now it’s time for us to focus on the nine families. We need to be in solidarity and praying for families and our communities around this state, particularly in Charleston. And people who have heard the calls for solidarity came from around the area tojoin in mourning. Ijust wanted to stay here so that when the doors opened they could see, the congregation could see, that we are for them and that we’re here for them. We want to move forward as a community. That one, small evil is not going to let a whole community down. That determination to overcome the hatred of a gunman apparently motivated by racism was very much on display here. The response to this tragedy has really been led by the extraordinary courage and dignity shown by the families of the victims. They’ve even said they forgive the man who killed their loved ones. That’s not to say they don’t still want answers and want things to change. Reverend Waltrina Middleton lost her cousin DePayne in the attack. We are fighting for our freedom... Last night she addressed a protest rally here. Until we have dedicated dialogue around race and racism in this country, we have a long way to go. Today has been about providing comfort, but the days ahead will need more soul-searching. Notjust here, but across this country. Parents of newborn babies in England and Scotland will be able to have them vaccinated against meningitis B from September. The programme, which is the first of its kind in the world, had been delayed because of negotiations over the cost. Campaigners have welcomed the news, saying it will save thousands of lives. Our Health Correspondent Sophie Hutchinson reports. Tommy, like most three-year-olds, is full of energy, but he will always live with the scars of meningitis. He was just five months old when he got the infection and lost three limbs. His mother said the morning she took him to the GP was when the nightmare began. just looked at Tommy in my daughter’s hand and said, just call an ambulance. And there’s people running everywhere and I just slid down the floor. And he’s looked at me, got me in the other room to talk, to Tommy, where they were injecting him. He had oxygen on and everything. And the doctorjust says to me straightaway, julie, he’s got meningitis. julie Tuckley has campaigned for children to be immunised against meningitis B with a new vaccine. She is delighted the NHS will introduce it for babies, like her new daughter, Georgie, from September. All infants will be offered at two months, a second dose at four months, and a third dose at 12 months. Meningitis B is a bacterial infection that particularly affects children under the age of five. It can cause severe brain damage and blood poisoning and it kills one in ten infected babies. But this new vaccine will protect against 88% of the different meningitis B strains circulating in the UK. The new vaccine was approved for use in Europe in 2013 and charities have criticised the two year delay in bringing it in. The sad fact is that lives have been lost needlessly because of the delay in the negotiations on the price of the vaccine. But now we’ve crossed that line. And lives will be saved. The protection for babies is accompanied by a vaccine for teenagers for meningitis W. It is a rare, but another dangerous form, of the interaction. 17-18-year-olds will be offered a jab from August. Tomorrow’s eurozone summit on Greece will be followed later in the week by another significant EU gathering - talks in Brussels where David Cameron is expected to lay out his demands for reform to 27 other member states. The meeting is likely to set the tone for negotiations ahead of the in/out referendum, promised before the end of 2017. Our Europe editor Katya Adler has been exploring how the Prime Minister’s likely to be received. Here’s what she discovered in Spain. So many of us holiday in Spain, we feel we know the country, the music, the food. But what about the politics? Spain’s a bit of a wild card in the midst of a political upheaval. Traditional parties may not be in power here next year and that could affect David Cameron’s chances for reform. All EU governments have to be on board for treaty change and here in Spain and the Prime Ministerjust doesn’t know who he’ll be dealing with. The current centre-right government regards Britain as a friend, it’s on-board for making the EU more competitive, but it’s against treaty change and discriminating against workers from other EU countries. I would be very careful on saying this requires a treaty change. And it takes a unanimous vote in 28 parliaments. What happens if it fails somewhere? I think this is very risky. There are certain values, certain principles, that we all share. But we can’t touch them, we shouldn’t touch them. And we’re not going to do it. Up and coming populist parties here disagree with almost all David Cameron’s proposals, they want radical change in Spain and the EU. Now it’s time to change. People who can vote is demanding that change. But David Cameron wants change. TRANSLATION: But we want a different EU, one representing the people, not serving the interests of banks and big business. The British government is asking for change that further favours financial markets. At the moment in the EU, those who have power get to dictate to those who don’t. Here in southern Spain there is around 1 million people feeling powerless. And very angry. They are Brits who live in Spain. The UK isn’t allowing long-term expats to take part in the EU referendum. But if there is a no vote, these people will live their right these people will lose their right to live here as EU citizens. A lot of Brits on the Costas, right up the Costas, they cannot have a vote on their future. Why is that? If it comes that they do a referendum of what happens, my son was four months old when he came. He’s 32 now. What does he do? You know, if he then has to leave here because he is not legal to work here. A lot of people in England think people come over here, have a season, then go back. But this is our home, this is where we belong, this is where we’ve made our families. And it’s not right that we can’t have a vote on it. So many opinions in only one country. But domestic politics in all EU nations counts. It affects government’s ability for reform and willingness to listen to a British Prime Minister. With all the sport, here’s Ore oduba at the BBC Sport Centre. Thank you, Mishal. Andy Murray has won a record-equalling fourth title at Oueen’s. This year’s, though, was a little more unusual as he had to overcome not one but two opponents in a day. Here’s David Ornstein. Home soil is supposed to provide home advantage. For Andy Murray, Saturday’s brain made it more of a hindrance. He would have to work a double shift today. His response: Emphatic. This was the first game after the resumption of Murray’s semifinal against Viktor Troicki. There would be no looking back. He dominated the opening set. Though the second required a tie-break, Murray was too good for an opponent he has now beaten in each of their seven meetings. It left the British number one with two hours to prepare a plan to get his name on the trophy again. It was never likely to be a stroll against South African Kevin Anderson. Six foot eight with an imposing serve. This time not the weather, but another form of nature. Nothing would derail Murray. He broke in style to take control of the first set and despite Anderson delivering his 100th ace of the tournament, Murray mixed the sublime with the ridiculous. Is making him feel about five foot two. To triumph with an outstanding performance. It’s extremely difficult to win these events and everyone is improving all of the time, playing against some of the greatest players that have ever played. You need to keep working hard, trying to get better. ForAndy keep working hard, trying to get better. For Andy Murray that’s a fourth Queens title and with Wimbledonjust a week fourth Queens title and with Wimbledon just a week away he’s in ominous form. The last time he won, in 2013, he went on to win Wimbledon. Lewis Hamilton is nowjust ten points clear in the Formula 1 World Championship after Nico Rosberg cruised to victory at the Austrian Grand Prix. Hamilton started the race on pole, but his time at the front was short-lived, as Nick Parrott reports. Nico Rosberg could barely contain his delight in victory at the Red Bull Ring after missing out on pole position, the smart money would have been on Lewis Hamilton to win. But his advantage in starting from pole lasted all of nine seconds. Rosberg has won the start into turn one. And from there he cruised to the chequered flag. Hamilton wasn’t the only one caught by surprise on the opening lap, Kimi Raikkonen found the McLaren of Fernando Alonso on top of his Ferrari. Only their pride was hurt. Any hope of fightback from Hamilton evaporated after he changed tyres, crossing this white line as he returned to the track saw him given a five second penalty. He wasn’t the only one who messed up, Ferrari cost Sebastian Vettel third place during his pit stop. Hamilton’s champion lead has been cut to ten points. He’s beaten Hamilton once again in Europe this season. He can expect a much tougher race at Silverstone in a fortnight. England’s under-21s have taken a huge step towards the knockout stage of the European Championships with a 1-0 win over Sweden. Defeat would have eliminated Gareth Southgate’s side, but a late volley from Manchester United forward jesse Lingard secured the win. Theirfinal group game is against Italy on Wednesday. And some superb performances on the final day helped Great Britain finish top of the medal table at the Rowing World Cup in Italy. Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took one of four golds today. The Olympic, World and European champions’ victory in the women’s pair extended their unbeaten run to 33 races. And that’s all your sport. Mishal. That’s all from me. Stay with us on BBC One.

And victory in court for a far-right group who plan to protest in Luton this weekend. Good evening. Three major terror attacks have been carried out in Tunisia, Kuwait and in France, claiming the lives of more than 50 people. The attacks aren’t thought to have been coordinated, but do appear to have been carried out by Islamist extremists. The highest death toll was in the Tunisian seaside resort of Sousse, where 28 people were killed near two tourist hotels. The Tunisian government says Britons are among the dead. Holidaymakers described panic as they heard gunfire, and said the ordeal had been ""horrific"". One gunman has been shot dead and another is in custody. The first of our reports tonight is from our correspondent Caroline Hawley. It contains details some viewers may find distressing. This is the beach where holiday- makers had This is the beach where holiday-makers had been sunbathing and swimming, when suddenly they were under attack. Local television showed were under attack.

Some people tried to hide, but he took out some grenades and threw them after them. out some grenades and threw them afterthem. Injured after them. Injured were rushed to hospital, still in their swimwear. The Tunisian Health Ministry says Britons, Germans, Belgians and Tunis ins are among the dead. Terrified tourists who survived talk of running for their lives, hiding wherever they could. I heard someone firing a gun, and then I looked at mY firing a gun, and then I looked at my wife, and she got up and ran, and asl my wife, and she got up and ran, and as I turned, the bulletjust hit me in my arm.

This is how another British survivor kept himself safe, barricading his door with a bed after fleeing to his room from the pool when the shooting began. As a security sweep was launched, a suspect was detained, although it is not clear what role he may have played in the 2nd massacre of tourists in Tunisia this year. In March, 22 people were killed in another shooting at the National Museum in the capital, Tunis. The tourist industry had onlyjust started to recover after that attack. The Foreign Office says it is owned -- urgently trying to find out how may British people have been affected. It sent a crisis team from the embassy and urged British holiday- makers the embassy and urged British holiday-makers to stay the embassy and urged British holiday- makers to stay indoors. As Tunisia reels from this bloodbath, its president says his country cannot cope with the Islamist threat it cannot cope with the Islamist threat iHxu France has begun a terror investigation after a man’s body was found decapitated during what’s suspected to be an Islamist attack on a gas plant in the south-east of the country. The French President, Francois Hollande, has said he’s raising the security level to ""attack"", the highest possible level, for the next three days in the region. Police arrested a man in his 30s at the scene near the city of Lyon. Imogen Foulkes is at the scene for us. That’s right. France is now starting another major terror investigation. It is less than six months since the attacks injanuary on It is less than six months since the attacks in january on the Charlie Hebdojournalists. And what began here as a quiet ordinary working day on an ordinary industrial estate. The events have shocked this small French town and indeed the entire country. Viewers may find some of the details in this report distressing. French police rushed to the scene this morning, after reports of a possible terrorist attack. A car trying to ram storage canisters at this US owned chemical factory. One eyewitness described the scene. TRANSLATION: just before loam there was an explosion. My colleague and I thought it was a plane flying low just over our site. just afterwards there were loads of police and fire engines. They stopped in our road. Then we learned there was an attack at the factory. Once inside the factory premises, police made a gruesome discovery, the decapitated body of a local businessman. Nearby, Islamist flags. France’s president has no doubt this was a terrorist attack. TRANSLATION: They attacked this factory using gas canisters. We have no doubt that the attack was aimed at blowing up the building. It bears all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack. French police have arrested a man. He is believed to have worked here delivering materials and was apparently known and allowed to drive in. The decapitated body is thought to be that of his boss. His wife, interviewed by French media just after his arrest, expressed astonishment. TRANSLATION: My heart feels like it’s going to stop. I don’t understand anything. On the news it said a terrorist act, but it’s not possible. I know him. He’s my husband, we have a normalfamily life. He goes to work, he comes home, we have nothing. You come to the house and search it, do what you like, but we have a normal life. In the last hour or so we have heard that she has been arrested two. just six months after the deadly attacks on the Charlie Hebdojournalists, France is once again on high alert. As the investigation gets underway, there are many questions about what happened here. Police will certainly be looking at whether there is any connection with today’s attacks in Tunisia. And today saw another horrific attack at a mosque in Kuwait. At least 25 people were killed. So what are we to make of today’s spate of attacks? This report from Frank Gardner. Massacre in a MBSSBCFE il’I B ITIOSQUE. Shia Muslims murdered income weight today and over 200 injured as they knelt for Friday prayers and a bomber walked in and blew himself up. -- in Kuwait. Islamic State quickly claimed responsible at it, part of efforts to set up a sectarian war between Islam’s two main branches. It was one of three attacks condemned today by world leaders. The people who do these things, they sometimes claim they do it in the name of Islam. They don’t. Islam is a religion of peace. They do it in the name of a twisted and perverted ideology that we have to confront with everything we have. Today has seen three major terrorist attacks, all byjihadists, and spread across three continents. Into weight, the attack was sectarian. Sunni extremists from Islamic State, targeting a Shia mosque. They are hoping to turn these two sects of Islam against each other. It follows a similar bombings by Islamic State in Saudi Arabia. In France, assailants went for a double target. Factory was owned by a US company but also targeted was the French state and an individual businessman. IS is at war with France and has often called opportunistic attacks by its followers there. And in Tunisia, Western tourists have been hit for the 2nd time this year. Here, too, the jihadists will be hoping to hurt the country itself, trying to stop Tunisia from becoming a peaceful, secular democracy. But why now? Is there any reason why all three attacks are taking place during this month of Ramadan? For Isis, Ramadan is a month of war. They believe it to be the month of jihad. Another reason is that part of their ideological underpinning is that they believe this is precisely the sort of thing they should be attacking. That is to governors, energised and motivate their fighters. Today’s attack has stunned peaceful Kuwait. Bombing a mosque, murdering tourists in Tunisia, decapitating a businessman in France, these jihadist atrocities, coordinated or not, are all inspired by the extremists of Islamic State. World condemnation means little to them. It may even encourage them to commit further attacks. Let’s look at the day’s other news now. David Cameron says he remains confident that he can secure a ""new and different membership"" of the European Union. The Prime Minister admitted that treaty changes were ""never going to happen"" before a British referendum. But he said there would be substantial improvements before any vote. james Landale reports now from the EU summit in Brussels. The European Union is being sorely tested. Its currency threatened by a row over who should pay the bills, its open borders challenged by a crisis of migration and one country threatening to leave unless there’s change. It’s little wonder this summit was a scratchy affair in which EU leaders asked officials to begin negotiating the detail of David Cameron’s reforms, before discussing them again at another summit in December. Our membership of the EU will once again have a Common Market at its heart. We will have got off the treadmill to ever-closer union. We will have addressed the issue of migration to Britain from the rest of the EU. We will have protected Britain’s place in the Single Market for the long-term. It will not be the status quo. But Britain’s reforms aren’t the only things challenging the founding idea of a union that is supposed to work together for the good of Europe. Late into the night, EU leaders squabbled over who should look after the migrants coming over their southern borders. For a union, there wasn’t much unity. They did agree to relocate 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece around the rest of the EU over the next two years. But they couldn’t agree how or where, much to the frustration of the Prime Minister, whose country has received most migrants. TRANSLATION: It is not possible that faced with such a big emergency selfishness would triumph. Europe is solidarity, not selfishness. Mr Cameron said relocating migrants in fixed quotas around Europe would be counter- productive. How much do you think the migration crisis, the Eurozone crisis, will make it harder for you to convince voters to stay in a reformed European Union? Particularly during the Eurozone crisis, I think people in Britain were looking at Europe and seeing economic stagnation, seeing economic problems and asking the question, do we - is our association, is our membership of this organisation, is it beneficial for Britain? And I believe it is beneficial for Britain. But I want to make it more beneficial. This afternoon, Europe’s leaders headed off in their various directions, not all their problems solved, not all their divisions reconciled. An EU in flux that David Cameron hopes may prove a catalyst for change. james Landale, BBC News, Brussels. In Tunisia, as the injured were rushed to safety at least 28 people, mostly tourists, died in an attack on a beach. The Tunisian government says Britons were involved. And coming up: Mo Farah has announced he will continue to work with his coach, Alberto Salazar. It follows Mr Salazar’s lengthy denial that he’d violated anti-doping rules. Later on BBC London. Fears that services in London could face more than a billion pounds of funding cuts next year, but what impact will it have? And the jewish community and synagogue welcoming Muslims to eat and pray to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. The Queen has visited the site of the World War Two concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, on the final day of her state visit to Germany. Tens of thousands of prisoners from all over Europe were killed at Belsen, including Anne Frank, who died of typhus there. Belsen was liberated by British soldiers and is now a memorial to those murdered by the Nazis. Our Royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, is there. British soldiers who liberated this camp on 15th April, 1945, said that of all the things they had witnessed during the Second World War, this was by far the worst, the most horrific. The Queen has never before visited the site of a Nazi concentration camp. Her visit here today was her personal wish. She would have been a young woman of nearly 19 when the world first heard of this place. This is Belsen, the Nazi concentration camp that stood here was long ago razed to the ground, but the memories of what happened here are indelible. It was April 1945, British forces were advancing through Germany when they came unexpectedly on a place of horror. It was described by the BBC war correspondent, Richard Dimbleby. NEWSREEL: I passed through the barrier and found myself in the world of a nightmare. Dead bodies, some of them in decay, lay strewn about the road and along the rutted tracks. Inside the huts, it was even worse. I have seen many terrible sights in the last five years, but nothing, nothing approaching the dreadful interior of this hut at Belsen. It’s estimated some 50,000, mostlyjewish, prisoners died at Belsen, principally from disease and starvation. One of the first British officers to enterthe camp was Captain Eric Melrose Brown. Tier upon tier of human beings, dying, or already dead in some cases. Death was just in the air. There was evil hanging over this whole place. One of those liberated from the camp was Anita Lasker-Wallfisch. This is her in the centre holding the ball. Her parents had been killed. She’d survived Auschwitz because she was part of the camp orchestra, then she was sent to Belsen. There are no words in the vocabulary to describe what was going on here. Imean, I mean, it needs a lot of imagination. You think of bodies smelling, decaying bodies, that was Belsen. The Queen placed a wreath at the memorial. She met some of those who had been here 70 years ago. And then it was time to go, but not before one last glance. It’s difficult to imagine, isn’t it? ""It’s difficult to imagine."" What more needs to be said? Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Belsen. Intensive diplomatic efforts are continuing to try to reach a deal to prevent Greece from defaulting on its debts next week. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has held talks with the leaders of Germany and France at the EU Summit. He’s accused Greece’s international creditors and the EU of blackmailing his country. Eurozone ministers will meet tomorrow to consider a new offer to extend a bailout for Greece. The US Supreme Court has ruled today that gay marriage is legal. Until today, gay marriage was unlawful in a third of US states. Crowds outside the court reacted withjubilation and President Obama said the ruling was a victory for America. Mo Farah has announced he will continue to work with his coach Alberto Salazar. The athlete’s announcement comes after Mr Salazar issued a 12,000-word denial that he had violated anti-doping rules. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, reports. For three weeks now, Britain’s most successful athlete, Mo Farah, has faced the biggest decision of his career, whether to stand by his American coach, Alberto Salazar, in the face of serious doping allegations. But now, two days after Salazar issued a 12,000-word denial, the Olympic Champion has decided to back him. In a statement, Farah said: It was in this BBC documentary that Salazar was accused of violating doping rules, along with his star pupil, American runner, Galen Rupp. There was no suggestion that Farah, who trains with both men in the US, was guilty of any wrongdoing. Last night, Salazar appeared in public for the first time since the start of the controversy in Oregon, along with Rupp, who reiterated his own denial and backed his coach’s rebuttal. Istand behind it 100%. I was really happy when it came out. I support it and I believe in clean sport. The BBC understands Salazar’s being investigated by the US Anti-Doping Agency and UK Athletics is conducting its own review into Farah’s training regime, but for now he is sticking with the man who helped him become the greatest distance runner on the planet. Dan Roan, BBC News. jaguar, Triumph and Rover. All legendary British cars that once rolled-off production lines in Coventry. Now the city, along with the surrounding area of Warwickshire, has reinvented itself as a hub of hi-tech vehicle manufacturing and engineering. Aston Martin isjust one iconic brand that’s benefited from this. Our business correspondent, Emma Simpson, has been for a spin in its latest model. Too powerful to be driven on a normal road. The cost? A cool £1.5 million, plus tax. And I’m the first person to get a ride in Aston Martin’s Vulcan. OK, Darren, show us what you can do. Woah! It’s a rocket on wheels. The acceleration isjust incredible. Back at the plant, a glimpse of the on-the-road luxury cars, virtually handmade, but losing money. A big revamp is now under way, new funding for the much-needed next generation of cars. I took a ride with the new boss, all too aware of the challenges ahead. The company, in its 102-year history, has really only been profitable twice, nobody has ever made any money out of the brand, which is strange because it is such an iconic brand, it is so powerful and it does deserve better. So, this is make-or-break time? This really is make-or-break time, yes. This region certainly is roaring ahead. jaguar Land Rover isjust down the road, doubling in size, and local suppliers are thriving. At Semcon, they design all parts of the car, from the motor to the manual. Growing so fast, this Swedish company needs a bigger space. But to really tell the tale of foreign investment here, I need to go from the coupe to the cab. Made in Coventry, but the new owners are Chinese and they’re ploughing £250 million into a new factory to research and build the taxis of the future. This business has reinvented itself and so, it seems, has Coventry and Warwickshire. We have really seen a tremendous transformation. We now see unemployment at the lowest level in 30 years. We have seen the addition of five internationally-renowned research institutions in the area and we have seen the car industry go from the engine room of the economy to now the engine room and the brains of the automotive sector. There’s plenty of brainpower going into this, Aston’s car for the future. The boss believes this company can make a comeback, too. Emma Simpson, BBC News. He’s the boy wizard who captivated children all over the world and sold millions of books and cinema tickets. And now the magic of Harry Potter is heading to the stage. On the 18th anniversary of her first novel being published, jK Rowling has announced the stage show will be called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. David Sillito reports. Today is an anniversary. 18 years ago, a book came out. The first Harry Potter. Since then, 450 million books have been sold. Eight blockbuster movies and now theatreland is going to be welcoming Harry. A new story about Harry and his parents. Dear Mr Potter... But it won’t be a prequel. That’s all we have from today’s confirmation by tweet from jK Rowling. I’m really excited that they’re doing it. It will be amazing. It’s going to be on stage. You kidding? Can we go see it? When? 2016. That is a long time. I’m going to have to make myself busy for a while. I can handle it. Ican wait. It is a few months, but I can do it. You are excited ? just a little bit. just a little bit excited. As you can see, this is Diagon Alley. A whole Harry Potter industry has grown up. More than a million people year come here. A new Harry Potter story, a stage play, you canjust imagine the demand. I think Harry Potter will be absolutely huge on stage, particularly given that they’re creating an entirely original story for it. Plus, jK Rowling herself is involved so it has an amazing theatrical team behind it. Of course, jK Rowling has said in the past there’ll be no more Harry books. The play means she has kept her word, but still found a way of telling a new Harry story. David Sillito, BBC News. Time for a look at the weather with jay Wynne. This line of cloud is a cold front. It is moving eastwards, but ahead of it we saw the warmest day of the year so far, 27.8 degrees in Gravesend. That will be eclipsed by what is set to happen through next week. Hot air across Spain will be coming northwards, across much of the United Kingdom. Temperatures will get into the low 30s in the South East. Some question marks about how hot it is going to get. Remember that cold front? That will continue itsjourney Remember that cold front? That will continue its journey eastwards. continue itsjourney eastwards. It will introduce some much fresher conditions behind it. Still some rain to be had on that across the South East through the first part of the evening. The second part of the evening, it is fine and dry for most places. There will still be one or two showers dotted around Scotland and Northern Ireland. Air temperatures overnight, 13 or 14 degrees. Humidity is that bit lower. That sets up for a decent start to the weekend. It is a dry day for most places. A few showers in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The bulk of England and Wales, patchy cloud, sunny spells and light winds. It will feel pleasant. So, a very decent day for getting out and about. However, pollen levels will be quite high and UV levels will be quite high. We change the script for the second part of the weekend. We have this wet and windy weather moving in from the west. That will take a while to get down to the South East. Through the afternoon, there could be some heavier bursts across Northern England. Temperatures in the upper teens, or the low 20s. Of course, next week, Wimbledon gets under way. course, next week, Wimbledon gets underway. It under way. It looks like it will be decent weather. Tuesday, 28 degrees! It will get hotter by Wednesday. Let’s go back to our top story, today’s terror attacks in France, Kuwait and in Tunisia, where the authorities say there have been British fatalities. Our correspondent, Iain Watson, is at the Foreign Office tonight. Iain what’s the Government doing in response? We are expecting a statement very shortly from the Foreign Secretary. He’s been chairing the Cobra emergency meeting. He is making some urgent calls. The official line from the Foreign Office here is they can’t confirm any British deaths as yet. I have to tell you that the unofficial line coming from some Whitehall sources is we are likely to get confirmation of British deaths later this evening. The British Embassy has sent a Rapid Reaction Force to the area. They will offer advice on how people might be able to get home. The Foreign Office has strengthened its travel advice to Tunisia. Its advice is to stay away from certain areas and advice to people in the area to stay indoors, not to advertise their presence on social media and tonight’s meeting is looking at the response here, talking to Home Office officials and to the intelligence services about what can be done in the future. There may be questions asked about whether there should have been stronger travel advice about Tunisia following attacks there in March. Thank you. That’s all from the BBC News at Six, so it’s goodbye from me and on BBC One we nowjoin the BBC’s news teams where you are.

The number of GP’s in London committing suicide is believed to be increasing, partly due to the pressures of work. The former Head of the Royal College of GP’s says the problem in London is particularly acute and it’s leading to more and more doctors here needing help. Sarah Harris has been looking at why London’s GP’s might consider taking their own life. The GPs I have been talking to today have been telling me that it is the sheer numbers of patients that they have to see in a day which is causing them the stress and the pressure. An individual GP in London can see more than 70 patients per day. It’s that stress under pressure which is causing some GPs to reach breaking point. There is as sense in which you are expected to get on, grit your teeth and do the job. He was trained to care for other, but after six years as a GP, he was the one needing treatment. I broke down in the middle of a consultation Ijust started crying, a patient said something to me, that was just, the last straw and I felt I couldn’t take it any more. Tan yell eventually left his job as a general practitioner. It is really good that you were able the find your way to us. At this London clinic, the aim is to support GP, to keep them in the job. According to their figures 150 London GPs were referred to them when they set up in 2008, that number rose to 600 this year. General practitioners especially now, are suffering from stress, burn out, but sadly, also from depression, anxiety and increasingly are taking their own lives. This is the only service of its kind in England. This doctor is the former chair of the Royal College of GP, here she is treating a London GP who doesn’t want to be identified. Compared to when you were first here... I was becoming suicidal. This was the first time I felt I would get better, the first time I was given the time as a patient to speak about my illness. In a statement NHS England acknowledges GPs are under pressure, it says its aiming to increase the workforce, and reduce bureaucracy. The doctor doesn’t accept critics who say doctors are relatively well paid, and should accept stress as part of the job. It is important that doctors pull their own oxygen mask down first and it is important that doctors do the things they need to do, in order to make themselves safe for patients. And there are fears that without support, more London GPs will find the pressures of work too much to bear. So Sarah, there are calls for more support for London’s GP’s. Is that going to happen? What’s interesting is that hospital doctors but I have been speaking to say they do know where to get help. It’s a big organisation so it is more obviously signposted. For GPs in London, they are on a smaller organisation. They say they can feel more isolated. This is the advice of one former GP. It can take time to pause and think about ways of working differently in the -- and the workload be managed using your team more wisely, using pharmacists to support patients. The particular emphasis is on working together. Most places in London are now working as part of the federation or network. The government is trying to take on an extra 5,000 GPs over the next five years. Many of them will be in London. The kind of experiences we have been hearing about today obviously won’t help that recruitment drives. Thank you. You’re watching BBC London News on BBC One. Still to come tonight: Claims that, between them, London’s councils could have to cut more than £1 billion from their budgets. A far right group created by former members of the British National Party has been given permission by a High Courtjudge to march through Luton this weekend. Bedfordshire Police wanted to ban 'Britain First’ from gathering in the town, but their application was rejected. The group has already gained entry into mosques in Luton and east London and has taken part in self-declared ""Christian Patrols’ in Tower Hamlets. Alpa Patel has been following developments. This highly controversial march will pass through this road, which has a mix of nationalities working and living here. It includes Muslim owned businesses. That is why the police have restricted the route significantly and why they try to stop the leaders of Britain’s first from coming to Luton altogether. The two leaders of the group outside the High Court earlier today. They were pleased that a judge ruled that they should not be prevented from marching with their far right group in Luton tomorrow. If anything, we are venting, we are allowing the English communities in towns up and down the country, we are giving them a voice. I have had enough of their neighbourhoods, there are areas, being taken over by mass immigration. They are fed up and they want an organisation that’s going to stand up for them, and that’s exactly what we do. Can you understand why your group will attract that sort of attention? Re-enact what sort of attention? I’ll stop this. You’re asking the same questions over and over again. ",,

There is as sense in which you are expected to get on, grit your teeth and do the job. He was trained to care for other, but after six years as a GP, he was the one needing treatment. I broke down in the middle of a consultation Ijust started crying, a patient said something to me, that was just, the last straw and I felt I couldn’t take it any more. Tan yell eventually left his job as a general practitioner. It is really good that you were able the find your way to us. At this London clinic, the aim is to support GP, to keep them in the job. According to their figures 150 London GPs were referred to them when they set up in 2008, that number rose to 600 this year. General practitioners especially now, are suffering from stress, burn out, but sadly, also from depression, anxiety and increasingly are taking their own lives. This is the only service of its kind in England. This doctor is the former chair of the Royal College of GP, here she is treating a London GP who doesn’t want to be identified. Compared to when you were first here... I was becoming suicidal. This was the first time I felt I would get better, the first time I was given the time as a patient to speak about my illness. In a statement NHS England acknowledges GPs are under pressure, it says its aiming to increase the workforce, and reduce bureaucracy. The doctor doesn’t accept critics who say doctors are relatively well paid, and should accept stress as part of the job. It is important that doctors pull their own oxygen mask down first and it is important that doctors do the things they need to do, in order to make themselves safe for patients. And there are fears that without support, more London GPs will find the pressures of work too much to bear. So Sarah, there are calls for more support for London’s GP’s. Is that going to happen? What’s interesting is that hospital doctors but I have been speaking to say they do know where to get help. It’s a big organisation so it is more obviously signposted. For GPs in London, they are on a smaller organisation. They say they can feel more isolated. This is the advice of one former GP. It can take time to pause and think about ways of working differently in the -- about ways of working differently in the -- and the workload be managed using your team more wisely, using pharmacists to support patients. The particular emphasis is on working together. Most places in London are now working as part of the federation or network. The government is trying to take on an extra 5,000 GPs over the next five years. Many of them will be in London. The kind of experiences we have been hearing about today obviously won’t help that recruitment drives. Thank you. You’re watching BBC London News on BBC one. Still to come tonight: Claims that, between them, London’s councils could have to cut more than £1 billion from their budgets. A far right group created by former members of the British National Party has been given permission by a High Courtjudge to march through Luton this weekend. Bedfordshire Police wanted to ban 'Britain First’ from gathering in the town, but their application was rejected. The group has already gained entry into mosques in Luton and east London and has taken part in self-declared ""Christian Patrols’ in Tower Hamlets. Alpa Patel has been following developments. This highly controversial march will pass through this road, which has a mix of nationalities working and living here. It includes Muslim owned businesses. That is why the police have restricted the route significantly and why they try to stop the leaders of Britain’s first from coming to Luton altogether. The two leaders of the group outside the High Court earlier today. They were pleased that a judge ruled that they should not be prevented from marching with their far right group in Luton tomorrow. If anything, we are venting, we are allowing the English communities in towns up and down the country, we are giving them a voice. I have had enough of their neighbourhoods, there are areas, being taken over by mass immigration. They are fed up and they want an organisation that’s going to stand up for them, and that’s exactly what we do. Can you understand why your group will attract that sort of attention? Re-enact what sort of attention? I’ll stop this. You’re asking the same questions over and over again. You have enough material. This is the type of taxing the group of used in the past. Entering a mask, this one in London, and distributing right-wing paraphernalia to Muslims. In Luton itself, people are less than pleased to have another high profile and controversial protest on their doorstep. The town has one of the highest concentrations of Muslims in the country, and has seen several protests by extremist groups over the past few years. I think it’s disgusting because this is a free country. I think everyone has the right to be here. It’s really unfair because a lot of people, people seem to forget that so many people from different nationalities were born here so it is their country. Thing-mac I believe in peace and I believe in harmony. I don’t want to fight with anyone else. #. We will protest against that because it’s not right, labelling every person, every Muslim is a terrorist. According to reports, the previously resigned from the group stating that it was and racist. The group has been warned by police that any racially inflammatory behaviour tomorrow will not be tolerated. It will result in arrests. The judge said the group would not be allowed to carry banners that could inflame tensions. The group had said that it wanted to carry a banner tomorrow that said, no Muslims, no mosques. There will be a counter demonstration. All this comes at a sensitive time for Muslims as they observe the month of Ramadan. Thank you. Cuts of over £1 billion could be faced by London’s councils next year. The estimate comes from the Local Government Association, who claim roads, libraries and children’s services will all suffer as a result. But the government says that while councils will have to play a part in cutting the deficit the figures are ""unsubstantiated"". Marc Ashdown reports. Bin collection, pothole repair, street lighting, libraries, just some of the services councils may have to rethink to make ends meet. The local authorities are predicting a funding cuts of £125 billion from central government next year. This centre looks after vulnerable older people in Suffolk, the sort of thing councils are desperate to keep. Children and adult services are draining resources. In 2010, for every £1 collected in council tax, 41p was spent on caring for the elderly and vulnerable adults and children. By 2019, that will have rocketed to £60 in every pound. We are having to look at cutting back on street cleaning, reducing day centres, charging more for social care. These are vital services for local residents on these government cuts will have an impact. But we have been here before with councils across the country already having slashed £20 billion over the last few years, mostly in efficiency savings, mostly unnoticed and the public. The council should be doing more to prepare people for this rather than hoping it will go away. Since I became leader of Ealing Council, I don’t think I stopped saying that we’ve got unprecedented cuts and we’ve got to, we got a massive problem. We try to mitigate them as much as possible but the level is so great that even the National Audit Office has said, basically, in four years, about one in four councils will actually go bust. Local government Minister Marcus jones told us the claims are unsubstantiated and premature, and says his department will continue listening to the views of councils and others about the best way of distributed funding to achieve fairness, efficiency and local growth. Experts say the public should expect some changes. I think the councils will need to explain to the public that it’s not that they’re doing this on purpose, it’s just that the government is reducing the reason horses very quickly. As people who live and work in London, we have to get used to the fact that the local governments can do less and will have to begin paying more through charges for public services in the longer term. We will know more after the budget next week, but the next few years could be tough for London’s councils and those who depend on their services. A 1lI-year-old boy has been stabbed in the back in Lewisham. Police were called to Deptford Green School yesterday evening, where the boy went for help after being attacked nearby. His injury isn’t thought to be life threatening, and police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. No arrests have been made. The West Sussex coroner says she will write to the Health Secretary, calling for a public inquiry into institutionalised abuse and neglect at a local care home, which contributed to at least five deaths. Victims’ relatives have welcomed the news, saying they’re not convinced that lessons have been learned across the country, following the scandal at the former Orchid View care home in Copthorne, near Crawley. Piers Hopkirk has more. They put faith in the carers, but they lost their lives to neglect. These are the faces ofjust some who died at this care home. Relatives today welcomed the coroner’s call for a wide reaching public enquiry. This is what our aim is, to get a public enquiry, to get the government is to look at this and see that they have a moral responsibility to protect the vulnerable as a whole. Russell Tucker’s mother Margaret was 77 when she died here. He says only a public enquiry would properly address the true extent of the failings. There are issues beyond West Sussex. They are national significance and there are gaps. The care home closed in 2011 after becoming the centre of a police investigation. Two years ago, an inquest found that neglect contributed to five deaths there are between 2009 and 2011. Last year, a serious case review made 30 recommendations to try to prevent future abuse in the care industry. Today, a year on from that review, relatives were told how agencies were wanting to the failings. Details on the 63 page report. The whole experience for the residents was absolutely awful. We felt strongly that we have to learn from what has happened is because we never really wa nt from what has happened is because we never really want this to ever happen again. While relatives welcomed the report, there were concerned that its impact would not spread beyond the borders of Sussex. jean died after being hit with an overdose of a drug here. There have been some changes that are taking place here but I don’t feel reassured about what happened to # That will # At what happened to my mother won’t happen again. Bertrand was 93 when he died, is thought from an injury sustained here. It’s too late for us, our relatives have gone. What we’re fighting for a change. Change in the system. The relatives say only a public enquiry will answer their questions. In the past five years alone, 2,000 people were seriously injured or killed by London’s buses. Now, in a bid to slash that figure, new technology is being installed into some buses to limit how fast they can go. At the moment, it’sjust a trial but if successful, the device could be installed into every bus in London. Tarah Welsh has been to see how it works. We don’t see pictures like this too often, likely, but crashes CBN i’I8VE SEI’ioUS CONSEQUENCES. More than 30 people were hurt when a bus hit a tree here, and three people were seriously injured when this double-decker lost control, going at Ao mph. The driver was found not to be at fault, but could this have made a difference ? Even though the driver might be asking for full speed, you can see there’s a difference between the two. The green bar starts to reduce. She wants to go faster but this isn’t letting her. Exactly. As we approach 20, the driver’s got their foot flat down, but there’s no power going to the engine. At first, it was weird. I had my foot down on the accelerator to the floor, but it wouldn’t go more than 20. It might be a good thing when you’re in traffic, or for pedestrians, cyclists. A lot of accidents are speed-related, so speed is involved in some way or another. We want to make sure drivers don’t need to worry about that aspect of driving in a crowded environment like London. It removes it from their worry list. The technology is being used on two routes, which is A7 buses. It trial lasts until the autumn. If TFL think it’s been a success, they’ll roll it out across the entire network. TFL says serious collisions have almost halved since 2008, but last year, BBC London heard from drivers claiming they’re still under pressure to meet time targets. Tom has been campaigning since he was left in a coma after being hit by a bus. This is about a system that does not prosecute lawbreakers and incentivises, through contractual terms, bus drivers to drive dangerously. It doesn’t change the targets at all. The average speed London is about 11 mph. It’s nonsense to suggest that the drivers are trying to drive very fast in order to meet targets. If the average speed is only 11 mph, why do we need this? There are certain times of the day, early in the morning, late at night. It will certainly reduce speeding tickets, but the jury is still out on whether it will save lives. Coming up before 7pm: The jewish and Muslim community coming together in a synagogue in north London. Now it’s over to Sara for the sport, and it’s not often we can look forward to motor-racing in London, although this is motor-racing with a twist. Sara can tell us more. It is, indeed, thank you, Asad. We’re talking about the quieter and more environmentally friendly version of Formula One - it’s called Formula E and Battersea Park has been transformed into a near two mile race circuit for the electric cars to race this weekend. London is the last leg of their first world championship tour and we sent Chris Slegg down to the banks of the Thames to find out more. Battersea Park this afternoon, the electric cars in practice. Tomorrow and on Sunday, they will be going even faster, hitting speeds of up to 140 mph. After nine races in cities including Moscow and Berlin, the first-ever World Championship will be decided in London. Here in the heart of Battersea Park, the ten team garages, the engineers working round-the-clock to get the cards ready with a week and’s racing. When it comes to the championships, six of them have a mathematical chance of winning the first-ever world title. Among them, Britain’s very own. This weekend is a chance to reach new fans in the UK and teach them about a sport still in its infancy. Conventional racing cars have a combustion engine. We have a battery sat underneath, which is the equivalent of 10,000 batteries. It weighs about 320 kilos so it’s pretty heavy. The batteries are rechargeable, just like your mobile phone. It takes about 40 45 minutes to charge. The race takes place on the existing roads in the park, which is close to the until 6:30pm -- roads in the park, which is close to the until 6:30pm -- 6:30am on Wednesday morning. The Mayor took a card for a spin this afternoon. There have been a couple of quibbles from local residents and we can understand that, but I think it has been managed very well. It was really good to organise this race after 43 years without a race in London. Its new technology, clean energy. We’re really happy to be embarrassing. It has been hailed as the green, sustainable and quieter future of motor sport. On its London debut, it hopes to make all the right noises. Now, as you’ve been hearing, England’s women are playing the quarterfinals of the World Cup against Canada this weekend and Arsenal goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain has said it’s the kind of match she dreamt about as a child. England are the underdogs going into the clash with the host nation, but the 31-year-old hopes the Lionesses will be able to prove the critics wrong to make their first ever World Cup semifinal To play the host nation in a quarterfinal in front of 55,000 people isjust incredible. It’s kind of what you dream of when you’re younger, and the atmosphere on Saturday will be electric. There won’t be many people there supporting us, but hopefully we can go out there and put on a great performance and maybe the Canadians will be supporting us afterwards. It’s a late one for the die-hard England fans but you can see if the Lionesses can knockout the host nation in the World Cup quarterfinal, England against Canada kicks off in the early hours of Sunday morning at 12:30am, right here on BBC One. The Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech will have a medical at Arsenal today ahead of his proposed move. The 33-year-old joined the Blues in 2004 but only played 16 times for jose Mourinho’s side last season. It’s understood that the transfer fee and personal terms have already been agreed. And it was the home of the Mountain bike course at the London 2012 Games, but today Olympic Gold medallist Victoria Pendleton officially opened the revamped Hadleigh Park course in Essex. The venue opened to the public in late April, after undergoing a £6.8million redevelopment. Most of the features from the Olympic course have been retained, but easier routes, including trails for walkers, horse riders and disabled people, have been added. I think it’s a fantastic world-class facility. It’s great that there are different options for different levels and abilities, so anyone can come along and have a go, or accomplished mountain bikers can come and hone their skills here. It’s a beautiful facility. You’d be forgiven for thinking there’s a massive gulf between jews and Muslims. Bombings in Gaza, attacks on Israel and then the murders in a jewish supermarket in Paris earlier this year. But, that’s far from the reality being practised at a synagogue in Golders Green. Worshippers there have opened their doors to let their Muslim neighbours pray and eat their evening meal after a day of fasting. Here’s Shabnam Mahmood. The Muslim call to prayer in a jewish place of worship. This synagogue in north-west London is holding an Iftar, the meal that marks the end of the day of fasting in Islam. It’s bringing Muslims and jews together. Historically, politically, there are differences between us, but there is actually an awful lot we have in common. We need to stress what we have in common and build on that, and with any luck we can then start talking about things where we don’t necessarily agree and find a way of developing, to be able to agree to disagree. This synagogue isjust one of many places of worship across the country that’s inviting people to share a meal during Ramadan. It’s part of the Big Iftar Project, which launched in 2013. I think it’s about saying to Muslims, open up more and share Ramadan with people. People are curious and want to know what it’s about. They want to know how we can manage fasting all these hours. I think it’s a brilliant opportunity to do that, but also the friendships will develop and grow. People who met each other here last year have come back this year and So ON. The main aim of the Big Iftar is to bring people of different religious backgrounds closer together, and to create a better understanding of Islam. I think it’s such a great event that we’re bringing two different communities together in one big community. Muslims and jews have this love of food and we also understand fasting because our faiths are similar. It’s lovely to see many so many Muslims in the synagogue and to hear the call for prayer. I really liked that I could join them for their prayers. just over 20 days to go before the end of Ramadan. More events like this are planned, and it’s notjust to break bread, but also to break barriers between people. And if you want to find out more about Now the weather with Helen Willetts Is going to get hotter, if you haven’t heard. Today, some beautiful weather with lots of sunshine. We had 27 degrees London. Look at the cloud. That has brought a few thunderstorms towards the north, this cluster moving towards high Wycombe. A few other showers, fairly isolated but a risk to the rest of this evening. The fog we have seen should be swept away through the early hours of Saturday morning, which will be bit fresher tomorrow morning. 20 of sunshine and a fresher feel by the end of the night. More comfortable if you have been finding the past couple of evenings difficult to sleep. The sunsets just after 9:20pm and rises tomorrow at 4:45am. Levy of sunshine tomorrow morning. Feeling fresher by day, but lovely and warm in the sunshine. With the sunshine comes very high pollen levels. More cloud building into the afternoon, but it should stay dry. 23 up to 25 degrees, so still very warm. Even if we see temperatures into the 30s next week, UV levels will be high. The sun will be out on Sunday morning, but it won’t last because we changed -- Sunday morning, but it won’t last because we changed -- we will be getting some rain. We will still see into the 20s and it should have cleared for the start of the championships, as we go into Wimbledon next week. Some finance dry weather but it is going to turn pretty hard. We could see temperatures into the low 30s. Hot by day and by night. Before we go tonight, let’s remind ourselves of the day’s main news headlines. British tourists are reported to be among the 28 victims of an attack by suspected militant gunmen in Tunisia. Sunbathers and swimmers scattered in panic. Police shot dead one of the attackers. The French authorities have arrested several people following a suspected attack by religious extremists, south of Lyon. counterterrorism has said it will be extra security for big events like the Gay pride march tomorrow, following the attacks in France and Tunisia today.

Good evening. At least five Britons are dead tonight - after a wave of major terror attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and in France. In all more than 60 people have died. The attacks aren’t thought to have been coordinated, but they do appear to have been carried out by Islamist extremists. The highest death toll was in the Tunisian seaside resort of Sousse, where 37 people were killed near two tourist hotels. The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said it must be assumed that a ""high proportion"" of those killed and injured were British. The first of our reports tonight is from our correspondent Caroline Hawley. It contains images you may find distressing. This is the beach where holiday- makers had This is the beach where holiday-makers had been sunbathing and swimming, when suddenly they were under attack. Local television showed were under attack. Local television showed the frantic effort here to help one woman injured by gunfire. For some of the casualties, some loungers became stretchers. Security officials said one of the attackers had been carrying his gun and a beach umbrella. He was shot by police, but only after dozens lay dead on the beach, by the pool, and on the terrace of the hotel. The injured were rushed to hospital, still in their swimwear. Tunisia’s health ministry says that Britons, Germans, Belgians and Tunisians are month dead. Terrified tourists who survived talk of running for their lives, hiding wherever they could. I heard someone firing a gun. Then I looked at my wife and she got up and ran. As I turned, the bulletjust hit me in my arm. Ijust ran to the sea. I ran to the sea, my wife ran to the hotel and I saw the gunman firing shots. Randomly at people laying on the sunbeds, on the beach. Also recovering in hospital is Matthewjames Also recovering in hospital is Matthew james from Matthewjames from Pontypridd, he used his own body to shield his fiancee, Saera Wilson macro -- Saera . I owe my life to him, he was covered in blood from the shots but he told me to run away. He told me, I love you, Babe, tell our children that their daddy loves them. This is how another British survivor kept himself safe, barricading his door with a bed after fleeing to his room. Olivia loosely from Cheshire, on holiday with her boyfriend, phoned her father as the attack was going on. It seemed she was running. She got into her room and said there was gunfire on the beach outside. About five minutes later, she rang again, this time she was running. I said, -- she said she thought they were in the lobby and was running for her life, she was crying, panic stricken, trying to find safety, trying to get hidden. As a security suite was launched, a suspect was detained although it’s not clear what role he may have played in the massacre. Later, images appeared on social media reportedly showing the attacker. The Foreign Secretary said five British people are known to have been killed but more are likely to have been murdered. It’s clear there have been a number of people killed. The situation is somewhat confused. We can’t be sure exactly how many. Because of the nature of the composition of the tourist population in this part of Tunisia, we have to assume a high proportion of those killed and injured will have been British. The Foreign Office has warned that some of the attackers in Tunisia may still be at large and now it’s been announced there will be extra -- extra security security for events this weekend, at Pride London and Armed Forces Day in response. This is the worst attack in Tunisia’s modern history. Holiday-makers have been warned to stay indoors. Manyjust now want to come home. And we can nowjoin our Tunis correspondent Rana jawad, who is outside the hotel where the attack happened. A second traumatic attack for Tunisia in the space of a few months - the atmosphere must be very tense? Yes, I was inside the hotel earlier. This is the hotel where the assailants attacked the beach, just on the other side. I was talking to some British holiday-makers earlier. One couple from Norfolk described a scene of mayhem, they were really scared. They said they were at the beach when the attacker started shooting and they were taken by hotel staff and had to hide in a laundry room. Another couple I spoke to, the husband said he thought his wife had been killed. He went looking for her in the bar area and found her and dragged her to an office near the reception. He said, we werejust waiting office near the reception. He said, we were just waiting to die, or for someone to come and get us. Everyone really upset. They are still at the hotel, not knowing when they can leave. There are more than more than 100 foreign national tourists still in there waiting to see when they can leave the country. Many thanks. France has begun a terror investigation after a man’s body was found decapitated during what was another suspected Islamist attack on a gas plant in the south-east of the country. The French President Francois Hollande has said he’s raising the security level to the highest possible for the next three days in the region. Police arrested a man in his 30s at the factory near the city of Lyon. Our correspondent Damian Grammaticas is at the scene for us. The shock of this attack was in its brutality. Isis, brought to the heart of Europe. Witnesses first heard a blast from a fund chemicals plant. TRANSLATION: just before 10am there was an explosion. My colleague and I thought it was a plane, flying low. just afterwards there were loads of police and fire engines. The firefighters were on site within four minutes of being called. Their speed appears to have been crucial. TRANSLATION: At 10am the firefighters are surprised the suspect, who was trying to open bottles of acetone. He was arrested and detained. He refused to give his identity, he was identified by the employees of the factory who knew him as a delivery man who regularly came on board the vehicle. Firemen overpowered him by the plant. He has been identified as Yassine Sali, 35, with no criminal record, but he did have known links to Islamic fundamentalists. It seems he was trying to lose the chemicals on the site to cause a bigger explosion. Next to his van police made a gruesome discovery, a body, the severed head attached to some nearby railings and with it some flags bearing inscriptions in Arabic. TRANSLATION: We are raising the anti-terrorist security operation to its highest level in the region for three days. Infact, we must see to it that all security checks are made. Yassine Sali’s wife and sister were taken in by police, along with another man. His wife told French radio her husband had gone to work as normal and was expected back for lunch. TRANSLATION: My lunch. TRANSLATION: My heart feels like it will stop. I don’t understand anything. On the news, it said a terrorist acts but it’s not possible, I know him, he’s my husband, we have a normalfamily life. The victim has been identified as the boss of the delivery company. Six months on it has renewed the sense that terror threat fans faces is severe and for all the heightened state of alert potential attackers are still almost impossible to pinpoint. And today saw another horrific attack at a mosque in Kuwait. At least 27 people were killed. So what are we to make of today’s spate of attacks? This report from our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. A ITIBSSBCFE iI’I B ITIOSQUE. Over two dozen Shia Muslims murdered in Kuwait today and over 200 injured, as they knelt for Friday prayers and a bomber walked in and blew himself up. So-called Islamic State quickly claimed responsibility. Part of its efforts to set off a sectarian war between Islam’s two main branches, Sunni and Shia. It was one of three attacks condemned today by world leaders. The people who do these things, they sometimes claim they do it in the name of Islam. They don’t. Islam is a religion of peace. They do it in the name of a twisted and perverted ideology that we have to confront with everything that we have. Today has seen three major terrorist attacks, all byjihadists, and spread across three continents. In Kuwait, the attack was sectarian. Sunni extremists from Islamic State targeting a Shia mosque. They’re hoping to turn these two sects of Islam against each other. It follows similar mosque bombings by IS in Saudi Arabia. In France, assailants went for a double target. The chemical factory was owned by a US company, but also targeted was the French state and an individual businessman. IS is at war with France and has often called for opportunistic attacks by its followers there. And in Tunisia, Western tourists have once again been hit for the second time this year. Here too though the jihadists will be hoping to hurt the country itself, trying to stop Tunisia from becoming a peaceful secular democracy. But why now? Is there any reason why all three attacks are taking place during this month of Ramadan? For Isis, Ramadan is a month of war. They believe it to be the month ofjihad, so another reason in fact is that part of their ideological underpinnings is that they believe this is the sort of month in which they should be attacking. That’s to galvanise, energise and re-motivate their fighters. Today’s attack has stunned peaceful Kuwait. Bombing a mosque there, murdering terrorists in Tunisia, decapitating a businessman in France - these jihadist atrocities, whether co-ordinated or not, are all inspired by the extremists of Islamic State. World condemnation means little to them. It may even encourage them to commit further attacks. And Frank Gardner is at the Foreign Office now. A day of terrible violence across several countries - and tonight there are some tough questions for the Foreign Office and how they keep British tourists safe. They are studying their existing how to change. Theirfirst to change. Their first responsibility, to change. Theirfirst responsibility, especially for the Foreign Office, is to account for all Britons they know are in the country. Last year nearly half a million Britons visited Tunisia. They have already warned that the bulk of those killed in today’s attack are likely to be Britons. As far as the UK security is concerned, they are tightening security around events this weekend. Given the international nature, the fact that these three attacks, not coordinated, have been spread across three continents. Then there is what is going on behind-the-scenes. It is fair to assume that all three intelligence agencies, MI6, MI5 and GCHQ, the listening station, will be going over what was known about any lead up to these attacks. Was there any chatter, any link between them, could anything have been done to warn people in advance for these attacks? President Obama has said America has been blind for too long to the ""unique mayhem"" that gun violence inflicts on the country. He was speaking at the funeral of Pastor Clementa Pinckney, one of nine people killed in a mass shooting at an African-American church at Charleston in South Carolina. Mr Obama said the US had ignored the way past injustices continued to shape the present. jon Sopel watched the service. They queued for hours in the heat, young and old, black and white, from Charleston and beyond, taking whatever shelter they could from the sun, all to pay their respects to Pastor Clementa Pinckney, gunned down with eight others as he led a Bible study class. Most were here to show solidarity. Some were friends. Why is it so important for you to be here today? Because this man was very, very, very special in my life. He was my son’s mentor. He has done a lot for the youth in our area, and we love him. He graduated like a year before I did, we went to school together. So it’s very important for me to be here today and it’s also part of history for me. -i-i’IâIââ WEFE SOFIQS, There were songs, there were prayers, and then there was the President’s eulogy. From Amazing Grace, he took the line ""I once was blind but now I see"". On race, first of all. For too long we’ve been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can permit so many of our children to languish in poverty, or attend dilapidated schools, or grow up without prospects for a job. But then he widened it out to gun crime. For too long we’ve been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation. Sporadically, our eyes are opened, when eight of our brothers and sisters are cut down in a church basement. And then the President turned preacher, as he sang the hymn himself. # Amazing Grace # How sweet the sound... # jon Sopel, BBC News, Charleston. President Obama has welcomed a Supreme Court ruling giving gay couples across the US the right to marry, saying the union had become ""alittle more perfect"". The court said same-sex partners could not be deprived of such a fundamental right. Gary O’Donoghue has this report. It was a day many thought would never come. America’s highest court, so often the venue for social change, ruling that marriage was notjust the union of one man and one woman. This is awesome, that gay marriage is now legal in the whole country. I’m so excited. Amazing. We’ve waited a long time. As the lead plaintiff, it’s this man, jim Obergefell, whose name will go down in history. A bittersweet day for a man, who lost his husband, john, two years ago, and just wants to be recognised as his spouse. I can now relax and know that the state of Ohio can never erase our marriage, our 20 year relationship, from john’s death certificate. While this decision is final, the court was split down the middle. Four of the nine justices voted against it, including the Chiefjustice, john Robertson, who said marriage had nothing to do with the constitution. That won’t worry the campaigners out here. One of the signs outside the court read, ""Notjust gay, ecstatic"". President Obama has already thanked the Supreme Court once this week, for upholding his controversial health care reforms. Today, he said the court had delivered a victory for America. Today we can say in no uncertain terms that we’ve made our union a little more perfect. But not everyone welcomed the decision. The frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, jeb Bush, tweeted: And another candidate for the nomination, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee tweeted: 11 years after the first gay marriage in the United States, today’s decision means that gay couples, wherever they live, will be able to get married. Gary O’Donoghue, BBC News, Washington. Let’s go back to jon Sopel in Charleston in South Carolina. Quite a 24 hours for President Obama. Yes, you could say it has been quite a 1+8 hours because yesterday the Supreme Court backed him on his health care reforms. If they had been hand-picked, it could have caused chaos. Today, gay marriage -- 9aY caused chaos. Today, gay marriage -- gay marriage, where he said America was a better place for the position of the Supreme Court. Add to that Congress giving fast track approval for a major trade deal with the Asian countries. Those are three spectacular victories for the president. But we shouldn’t lose sight of why he was here in Charleston earlier on, because the issue of guns and race have not gone away. And though it was one of the finest crafted speeches you will ever hear, rhetoric alone isn’t going to deal with those two intractable American problems. Another victim of the Alton Towers rollercoaster crash has had a leg amputated. 20-year-old Vicky Balch from Lancashire was one of five people who sustained serious injuries on the Smiler ride last month. Another victim, Leah Washington, had her leg amputated above the knee shortly after the accident. Intensive diplomatic efforts are continuing to try to reach a deal to prevent Greece from defaulting on its debts next week. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has accused Greece’s international creditors and the EU of blackmailing his country. Eurozone ministers will meet tomorrow to consider a new offer to extend a bailout for Greece. David Cameron says he remains confident that he can secure a ""new and different membership"" of the European Union. The Prime Minister admitted that treaty changes were ""never going to happen"" before a British referendum. But he said there would be substantial improvements before any vote. james Landale reports now from the EU summit in Brussels. The European Union is being sorely tested. Its currency threatened by a row over who should pay the bills, its open borders challenged by a crisis of migration, and one country threatening to leave unless there’s change. It’s little wonder this summit was a scratchy affair in which EU leaders asked officials to begin negotiating the detail of David Cameron’s reforms, before discussing them again at another summit in December. Our membership of the EU will once again have a common market at its heart. We will have got off the treadmill to ever-closer union. We will have addressed the issue of migration to Britain from the rest of the EU. We will have protected Britain’s place in the single market for the long-term. It will not be the status quo. But Britain’s reforms aren’t the only things challenging the founding idea of a union that is supposed to work together for the good of Europe. Late into the night, EU leaders squabbled over who should look after the migrants coming over their southern borders. For a union, there wasn’t much unity. They did agree to relocate 1+0,000 migrants from Italy and Greece around the rest of the EU over the next two years. But they couldn’t agree how or where, much to the frustration of the prime minister whose country has received most migrants. TRANSLATION: It is not possible that faced with such a big emergency selfishness would triumph. Europe is solidarity, not selfishness. But Mr Cameron said relocating migrants in fixed quotas around Europe would be counter-productive. How much do you think the migration crisis, the eurozone crisis, will make it harder for you to convince voters to stay in a reformed European Union? Particularly during the eurozone crisis, I think people in Britain were looking at Europe and seeing economic stagnation, seeing economic problems and asking the question, do we - is our association, is our membership of this organisation, is it beneficial for Britain? And I believe it is beneficial for Britain. But I want to make it more beneficial. This afternoon, Europe’s leaders headed off in their various directions, not all their problems solved, not all their divisions reconciled. An EU in flux that David Cameron hopes may prove a catalyst for change. james Landale, BBC News, Brussels. The Queen has visited the site of the World War II concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen on the final day of her state visit to Germany. Tens of thousands were killed there, including Anne Frank. It was liberated by British soldiers and is now a memorial to those murdered by the Nazis. She would have been a young woman of nearly 19 when the world first heard of this place. This is Belsen, the Nazi concentration camp that stood here was long ago razed to the ground, but the memories of what happened here are indelible. It was April 191+5, British forces were advancing through Germany when they came unexpectedly on a place of horror. It was described by the BBC war correspondent, Richard Dimbleby. NEWSREEL: I passed through the barrier and found myself in the world of a nightmare. Dead bodies, some of them in decay, lay strewn about the road and along the rutted tracks. Inside the huts, it was even worse. I have seen many terrible sights in the last five years, but nothing, nothing approaching the dreadful interior of this hut at Belsen. It’s estimated some 50,000, mostlyjewish, prisoners died at Belsen, principally from disease and starvation. One of the first British officers to enterthe camp was Captain Eric Melrose Brown. Tier upon tier of human beings, dying, or already dead in some cases. Death was just in the air. There was a pall of evil hanging over this whole place. One of those liberated from the camp was Anita Lasker-Wallfisch. This is her in the centre holding the ball. Her parents had been killed. She’d survived Auschwitz because she was part of the camp orchestra, and then she was sent to Belsen. There are no words in the vocabulary to describe what was going on here. I mean, it needs a lot of imagination. You think of bodies, smelling, decaying bodies, that was Belsen. The Queen placed a wreath at the memorial. She met some of those who had been here 70 years ago. And then it was time to go, but not before one last glance. It’s difficult to imagine, isn’t it? ""It’s difficult to imagine."" What more needs to be said? Nicholas Witchell, BBC News, Belsen. That’s all from us. Now it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. Police have failed in their attempt to stop the leaders of a far-right group from taking part in a march in Luton this weekend. The High Court rejected an application by Bedfordshire Police to prevent the leader of Britain First and his deputy from visiting the town. The group has already gained entry into mosques in Luton and east London and has taken part in self-declared ""Christian Patrols"" in Tower Hamlets. Alpa Patel reports. The two leaders of Britain First outside the High Court early today. Pleased that a judge ruled that they should not be prevented from marching with a far right group in Luton tomorrow. If anything we are venting, we are allowing the English communities in towns up and down the country such as Luton, we are giving them a voice. They have had enough, their neighbourhoods, their areas, their housing estates being taken over by mass immigration. ",,
159,BBC1 London,28-jun-2015,BBC News,18:30,20 mins,True,"Britain announces the biggest counter-terrorism inquiry for a decade into the attack here in Tunisia, as new claims emerge that the gunman did not act alone. New pictures show the gunman’s rampage on the beach, as he began the assault that claimed 38 lives. Many of them British. Survivors of the attack have been paying their respects. Many victims are still to be identified. Tragedy. Absolute tragedy. It is heartbreaking.

And England’s Lionesses roar into the Football World Cup semi-finals. Good evening from Tunisia. Teams of security officials are on their way here from Britain to help investigate last week’s attack on this beach resort, which claimed 38 lives. In the city of Sousse. It is understood from the Tunisian understood from the Tunisian authorities, most of them are authorities, most of them are British. Scotland Yard says that hundreds of counter-terrorism officials will take part in their biggest investigation for a decade. Medical teams are also flying out to help injured survivors. They are being treated in four hospitals here in Sousse. More details are emerging about the Tunisian gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui, with new claims that he did not act alone. Our first report is from Orla Guerin. You may find some of the pictures disturbing. Shaky footage filmed from a rooftop shows the killer on the move, looking for more victims. He sprints along the sand, assault rifle by his side. Locals call out for someone to catch him, but there was no-one to stop him racing towards the hotel. This is the smiling killer, 23-year-old student Seifeddine Rezgui, in a photo released by Islamic State. Here, one of the Britons he gunned down is carried away, we believe this is Alison Heathcote who was shot five times and is in critical condition in hospital here. This footage is thought to show Alison lying on the beach, waiting for help to come. You are all right, I stay with you. A man lies dead next to her. Don’t worry, all right? Alison’s family at home in the UK are increasingly concerned. Her brother Simon told us they have not been getting enough information from the FCO. And another wounded British woman remains in hospital here. Cheryl Mellor told us her story, but didn’t want to speak on camera. When the shooting started, she and her husband Stephen huddled together saying, I love you, I love you. The gunman reloaded, before shooting her twice, and killing Stephen. Two days after the carnage here, security has finally been tightened. Until now, we haven’t seen much of a security presence near the hotels, but these troops have now arrived and they said they will be deployed in the area. The authorities in Tunisia have promised to step up security at tourist locations and sensitive sites, but after two deadly attacks in just three months, many may wonder why this didn’t happen sooner. I tried to put that question to Tunisia’s Interior Minister when he visited the area today. Could we ask for your comments? So many British people have died here, was security adequate? Was security adequate here for the tourists? We are here for working. The Minister declined to comment further. And soon, we were prevented from filming. It was a very different picture last night when hundreds of local people held a vigil for victims of the attack. This was a show of grief and of solidarity, and the message was - not in our name. And some British holiday-makers who had to run for cover during the attack have decided not to fly home early. They want to show support for the people of Tunisia. I think people need to understand and really get behind them and | think acts of terrorism happen anywhere in the world so if you are not safe here, you are not safe anywhere. You cannot hold it against Tunisia. Would you say to people to come here? lwould, yes, definitely. The main reason I wanted to carry on was because I like Tunisia. As my wife said, the people are great, the staff have been great, they have been really supportive and I think we should stay for them, just as much as we want to stay ourselves, but to show them support. A short distance up the beach, some had come to grieve and to pay their respects. Among the mourners, reps who brought holiday-makers here but will never bring some of them back home. This picture-postcard landscape is changed forever, uniting Britain and Tunisia in sorrow. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Sousse. It had been thought that Seifeddine Rezgui had acted alone. But today, the Tunisian authorities said they were searching for one or more accomplices.

A coach carrying a party of British schoolchildren and their teachers has crashed in Belgium. The driver died and at least one child was seriously injured, when the vehicle came off the road and hit a bridge in West Flanders. Ben Moore reports. 34 children aged between 11 and 13 were on this coach A terrifying and tragic start to a school trip. 34 children aged between 11 and 13 were on this coach when it crashed on a Belgian motorway, on its way to Germany. It is believed to have hit the pillar of this bridge on the coastal road at Middelkerke, near Ostend. The driver was killed and his assistant has been seriously injured. As has one young boy, who is in intensive care with serious head injuries. At Brentwood School in Essex, staff came in to help pass on information and help comfort a steady stream of worried parents. Most of the children are absolutely, fine with some superficial injuries. One or two members of staff have broken bones, and obviously, our thoughts are with them. One of the boys has a fractured skull and he has a very small brain bleed. He is in intensive care, in hospital in Ostend. 34 children and four members of staff were waved off on the languages trip to Cologne at 4am from these gates outside the school. Now several parents and three members of staff have themselves travelled to Ostend to be with the children and bring them home.

Also tonight - Greece shuts its banks indefinitely, as the financial crisis deepens. Tourists are warned to take plenty of cash with them, if they’re heading to the country. England are in the semifinals of women’s World Cup for the first time ever! And England’s lionesses roar into the football World Cup semi-finals. Good evening from Tunisia. The BBC understands that at least 30 British people were killed in seas. Scotland Yard have announced they have launched their largest ever counterterrorism operations since 7/7. The first of our reports tonight comes from olra Guerin. You may find parts of her report distressing. Shaky footage filmed from a rooftop shows the killer on the move, looking for more victims. He sprints along the sand, assault rifle by his side. Locals call out for someone to catch him. We now know he claimed the lives of at least 30 Britons. Here is the smiling killer, 23-year-old student Seifeddine Rezgui. The photo was released by Islamic State. This footage shows one of the British tourists he gunned down, being carried away. We believe this was Alison Heath coat who was shot five times. As she lay waiting for help to calm, Hotel employee stayed by her side, holding her hand. She kept asking about her husband, Philip. Back home in Ipswich, Alison’s brother found out she had been injured from news reports and says there has not been enough information from the FCO. Critical. The next couple of days will be vital to whether she survives or not. She is fighting for her life, that is what they have said. He said Allison and their husband should have been celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary tomorrow. Philip is missing and Alison is in intensive care in Sousse. And another wounded British woman remains in hospital here. Cheryl Mellor told us her story but did not want to speak on camera. When the shooting started, she and her husband Stephen huddled together saying, I love you, I love you. The gunman reloaded before shooting her twice and killing Stephen. Two days after the carnage here, security has finally been tightened. Until now, we have not seen much of a security presence near the hotels, but these troops have now arrived and they say they will be deployed in the area. The authorities in Tunisia have promised to step up security at tourist locations and sensitive sites. But after two deadly attacks injust three months, many may wonder why this did not happen sooner. I tried to put that question to Tunisia’s interior minister, when he visited the area today. Could we ask for your comments? So many British people have died here. Was security adequate here for the tourists? Do you think there was enough security? The minister declined to comment further, and soon we were prevented from filming. It was a very different picture last night, when hundreds of local people held a vigil for victims of the attack. This was a show of grief and solidarity and the message was not in our name. Holiday-makers hearsay Tunisia and keep apologising for the killings, and some Britons who had to run for cover in the attack have decided not to fly home early. They want to show their support for the local community. I think people want to understand and get behind them. Acts of terrorism happen anywhere in the world. If you are not safe here, you are not safe anywhere, so you cannot hold it against Tunisia. Would you say for people to come here? I would, Would you say for people to come here? Iwould, definitely. Short distance up the beach, some had come to grief and pay their respects. Among the mourners, travel rats who brought holiday- makers respects. Among the mourners, travel rats who brought holiday-makers here but will never bring some of them back home. -- but will never bring some of them back home. -- travel representatives. This picture postcard landscape is changed forever and Britons and Tunisians are united in sorrow. So who was Seifeddine Rezgui - and how did a Tunisian student become a mass murderer? Our special correspondent Fergal Keane has been to meet his family in the village of Gaafour in the Siliana region, three hours drive from resort town of Sousse where he gunned down 38 people. This is the hinterland of a killer. The farmlands north-west of Sousse. Sleepy, unthreatening, yet it bred the man who has become the biggest mass murderer of Britons in a decade. Seifeddine Rezgui, aged 23, was studying electronic ‘s when he joined IS, carrying out his murderous rampage before being killed. Today, sitting outside the home where he grew up, we met his grandfather, Mohamed, utterly bewildered by the tragedy caused by a boy he adored. TRANSLATION: He called me Father, not grandfather. We can say he is guilty, he did it. They brainwashed him that I can tell you he grew up in my house and neither his mother, father or meet new about this. What kind of boy was he? He was calm, good at school. He did not skip class. The people in Britain have lost family members. What with this family say to them? I sent my sympathy to these people. What has happened has happened. It is human to be sad about this. And then a sudden moment of drama. The killer’s mother, just released from police questioning, was carried to a car. We have been told she has not eaten since the massacre and was taken to hospital. This is the school he went to, peace graffiti on the walls. It was here he joined a youth club where he loved break dancing. Fellow dancers told me of the friend they remembered. He was funny. A good person, never fighting. Neversaid bad funny. A good person, never fighting. Never said bad words. fighting. Neversaid bad words. He wasjust a good guy. Can you believe what has happened? Actually, no. And really sad for the people who died. For no reason, they were just having fun and death came and took them. I am really sad for them. As a friend, I am really sad for Seifeddine Rezgui. He wasjust I am really sad for Seifeddine Rezgui. He was just a normal guy like us. The terrorism took him. The terrorism took him. This is the city where it happened. This is one of the oldest Islamic centres in the world. Seifeddine Rezgui was studying at this college, but he drifted into extremist religion. He lived here in this flat with four other young men. The place where he lived with several other students has now become an object of curiosity. He lived just a few yards away from a mosque. It isjust over here. But it was a place to moderate in its teaching, in the views of a young man who was becoming increasingly radicalised. As neighbours shared stories of Rezgui, neighbours remember the man who never wore conservative Islamic dress and remembered him being very polite. I would see him outside. He would say normal things. He just said to you thank you, and the peace of God be with you? Guests. Do you think he fooled people? He has killed more than 30 people. In a poorer district, he attended a mosque where a more extreme version ITIOSQUE Wi’IâI’â B ITIOFE âXlI’âITIâ VâI’SiOI’I mosque where a more extreme version of Islam was preached. Today, they refused to speak to us about the man who once prayed here. Back in Gaafour, the children here are witnesses to a trauma and for the old man, the impossible question, how did a child raised with love become a monster? Well, the identities of the thirty Britons believed to have died here in Sousse are slowly emerging. Some families have lost both parents - others, members of more than one generation. Here’s Robert Hall. As flags flew at half- mast above Downing Street, more families, more communities where hearing the confirmation they dreaded. Hour by hour, we are learning more about those whose lives were brutally taken. jim and Ann Mcouire had only booked their holiday fortnight ago. They shared their plans with members of the local church in Cumbernauld. Today at the morning service, the congregation were told the news that the couple had died. I don’t understand the logic behind what he has done. I don’t see the point of what he has done. I understand their freedom fighters and people trying to make points, but there must other ways. Than doing what he has done. In south Wales, friends and co-workers were mourning Trudi jones, who worked with her sister at a local nursing home. She worked with us. She was a very popular member of the team. Always brought a bottle of pop, very lively, always smiling, always smiling. Two of the dead came from East Yorkshire. 72-year-old Bruce Wilkinson was killed as he sunbathed beside his wife who survived. The local MP paid tribute. We are devastated by the loss of Bruce who was a loving father, husband and grandfather. Claire wind us who had two children was due home in Hull today -- Claire wind us who had two children was due home in Hull today -- Claire wind us. Among the hundreds of holiday- makers returning to the UK were among those injured in the attack. Matthewjames, shot four times as he protected his fiancee Sarah Wilson, is now being treated in a Cardiff hospital. He is said to be stable and comfortable. Friends have praised his courage. He is one of the boys. An absolute hero in our eyes. Others cannot quite believe they escaped unhurt. The day before the massacre, Mark Barlow was Paris sending on the same beach. The next morning, he and his girlfriend were fleeing for their lives until local shopkeepers gave them shelter. My best friend, I kept telling her I loved her. We did not want to say goodbye but he kept getting closer. We told each other we loved each other. We thought it was the end, didn’t we? The memories of a sunny Mediterranean landscape will now forever be darker reminders of a terrifying day. Well, as we reported the largest counter terrorism investigation since the 7/7 attacks ten years ago is now underway. Let’s got to our home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, at Scotland Yard. What more do we know? There’s been a huge police operation this weekend involving 600 officers. They have been taking statements from people returning from Tunisia, collecting videos and photos from their mobile phones, gathering as much evidence as they can, as soon as they can. There are I6 officers on the ground in Tunisia working with local police, helping to identify those people who’ve died, but also trying to find out who it was that supplied that weapon to him and who it was that helped him with transport. It is worth reflecting that since the 7th july attacks ten years ago, only one person has been killed in Britain from a terrorist attack, and that was Lee Rigby. In that same decade, people have been caught up from Britain in terrorist outrages in all sorts of countries in different parts of the world. It’s for that reason that the Counter Terrorism Command here at Scotland Yard is now trying to significantly expand its foot fingerprint oversea, in simple terms, trying to put more police officers on the ground in countries where the problem is and trying to deal with the problem at source as they try to adapt to the dangers posed by the self-stied Islamic state or caliphate that was declared in Syria almost exactly one year ago. Thank you very much. Here in Tunisia tonight, the authorities say they are deploying about 1,000 extra police officers to protect tourist attractions, resorts, museums and so on, and they are also calling up army reservists. In London, the Foreign Office have warned that further terror attacks in Tunisia are still possible. The Greek Prime Minister says banks will remain closed tomorrow and limits will be placed on the amount of money people can withdraw from their accounts. He was speaking after the European Central Bank said it wouldn’t increase emergency funding, which means the banks are in danger of running out of funds. Our Chief Correspondent, Gavin Hewitt, is Athens for us. There is a lot of unease and confusion. People are trying to find out the limit on cash withdrawals. Some believe they might be limited to 60 euros a day. It’s gone Midnight but there are still some long queues outside the ATM machines here and people in Greece are waking UP here and people in Greece are waking up to the fact that they are now in the midst of, notjust a political crisis, but a deep, financial crisis too. Tonight, the Greek Prime Minister, Tsipras sip, met with his Cabinet. They were told the banks would remain shut indefinitely and there would be limits on cash withdrawals. Greece was in the midst of this and the Prime Minister appealed for calm. TRANSLATION: The deposits of Greek citizens in banks are completely safe. The payment of salaries and pensions is also assured. We have to deal with this calmly and decisively. What prompted the concern about Capitol controls, the European Central Bank decided against increasing emergency support for Greece’s banks and, after days of heavy withdrawals, it left the Greek banking system needing protection. Earlier in the day, the fear that banks might be closed drove people once again to the cash machines. Only 40% of them had money in. Since Friday night, 1.3 million euros has been withdrawn. It was the only subject at the lunch table. People are scared. You can see it every day at the restaurant. All the autobanks have long queues, everybody is worried about their money and they are drawing it out. There was an WGS BFI âITIâI’gâI’ICy ITIââliI’Ig There was an emergency meeting to decide whether there would have to be capital controls. The fear was that funds would be withdrawn without the ECB increasing support. An official promised they would take all measures necessary to ensure stability. The Finance Minister had time to join a demonstration, calling for people to reject the bail out proposal from the EU IMF in next week’s referendum. Others are questioning what impact the capital controls will have on the government’s support. It’s uncharted waters, this is a completely novel situation. The more people will be going to the ATMs, they’ll be finding that there is not enough money for them, I think this will increasingly change the way they perceive what is going on. A week today Greece will hold its crucial referendum that may well determine its future in the eurozone. The people’s choice will be made in the midst of a financial crisis. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston, who broke the story of the ECB’s decision not to increase funding to Greece, joins me now. There are restrictions on withdrawals, the banks will stay shut tomorrow, potentially for longer and it looks like Greece will default to the IMF on Wednesday morning. What does this mean for Greece and the eurozone? It’s very serious for Greece and the eurozone. just to put some more flesh on the story, I’ve been talking to a senior banker in Greece tonight. He says that the restriction on cash withdrawals from ATMs while the banks are closed will be 60 euros a day. Also, that he’s been told to expect to remain closed for at least a week, probably until the Tuesday of next week, it could be longer. I mean, just think how we’d all feel if tonight we were told we could only get Âl+0 out of the cash machine for the foreseeable future - we’d be pretty scared, pretty angry. We’d spend less. So the impact on the Greek economy is going to be pretty depressing. This is an economy that was struggling to grow. I would expect it to be tipped back into recession. Also pretty bad news for the eurozone as a whole. It’s a pretty shocking event when banks don’t allow you to get your money out. Now, if you are a company, or you run a company if you are a wealthy investor and have your money in fragile other economies, you will be thinking twice about leaving your money there. So over the coming weeks and months, capital may be more expensive to obtain in some of the weaker parts of the eurozone, and that could be very, very damaging for the whole monetary union project. Thank you. A coach carrying a party of British schoolchildren and their teachers has crashed in Belgium. The driver died and at least one child is seriously injured. Their vehicle came off the road and hit a bridge in West Flanders. Most of the children are absolutely fine. One or two members of staff had broken bones and our thoughts are with them. One to have boys has a fractured skull and he has a very small brain bleed. Now, he’s in intensive care in hospital in Ostend. The England Women’s Football captain Steph Houghton says she wants to inspire a generation after her team made history by reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup. Victory over the hosts Canada in the last eight, means they’ll now play the defending champions japan. Katie Gornall reports.

163,BBC1 London,25-jun-2015,BBC News at One,13:00,30 mins,True,"The Government’s multi billion pound plan to modernize the railways stalls, as Network Rails’ boss decides to stand down at the end of his term. The costs are spiralling out of control and modernization will take much longer to complete. Labour says the improvement programme is a complete shambles, we’ll have the latest. Also this lunchtime: It is crunch time for David Cameron as he prepares to tell a summit of EU leaders have the UK wants to reform the European Union. Islamic State restarts the battle to win the Syrian town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Victory would be a major success for the Islamists. Convictions for violent crimes against women and girls reach an all-time high,with many victims targeted online. And the groundbreaking surgery, that’s transformed this baby’s life. Later on BBC London: A decade on from 7/7 plans to create a register of those who witness tragic events so they can get help. And the Mayor’s peace offering to London’s black taxi drivers - will it be enough to improve relations? Good afternoon, welcome to the BBC News at One. It was hailed as the ""largest modernization of the railways since Victorian times"" and was at the heart of the government’s long term economic plan. But today the Chief Executive of Network Rail, Mark Carn, has told the BBC that its five-year £38 billion programme, was simply too ambitious. In the last hour the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, told MPs that modernization will now cost more and take longer. Labour described it as ""a complete shambles"" and ""a catalogue of failures."" Here’s our Transport Correspondent, Richard Westcott. We we re We were promised the biggest boost to our railway since the Victorians. A five-year plan to bring in bigger, quicker and more reliable electric trains. The company who said it could deliver the plan, now says it can’t. All of these problems could and should have been foreseen by Network Rail. I want to inform the house of the action I am taking to reset this programme and get it back on track. Network Rail’s progress and electrifying lines has been dogged by delays and costs. Big schemes will go on hold. Despite promises to build and Northern economic powerhouse, its northern passengers are losing out. Plans to electrify lines across the Pennines and linking Manchester with Leeds and Hull and the line linking London to Derby, Nottingham and Sheffield could both be delayed by years. Already behind schedule, plans to electrify the lines linking London and south Wales could also be delayed. We are paying more fairs each year and part of that was the expectation there would be improvements on the infrastructure on the tracks to enable the trains to be more punctual and reliable. just months after this engineering fiasco in London, Network Rail’s bossis fiasco in London, Network Rail’s boss is saying sorry again. Over the last year it is becoming obvious the challenges of operating, maintaining and enhancing the railway are significant. It is time to level with the public and say some of these extraordinary projects we do need are going to take longer and will cost more than we originally thought. Network Rail is getting a new chairman to help sort it out. He has been told to report that in a few months with a new, realistic plan detailing what they can do and how much it will cost. Let’s speak to Norman Smith. How big a blow is this for the government? It is significant. These improvements were meant to be the biggest shake-up in the railway since Brunel put on his top hat and stuck a cigar in his mouth. It was meant to revolutionise the railway is not seen since Victorian times. But since this project was on bail, already key part of that improvement programme have hit the buffers. The finger of blame is being pointed at Network Rail, who are responsible for the tracks, with the chairman gone and no bonuses going to be paid and a shake-up of the governance of Network Rail and an enquiry into theirfuture investment Network Rail and an enquiry into their future investment plans. theirfuture investment plans. But there are consequences for the government. A significant set back to George Osborne’s plans for a Northern powerhouse. It raises questions over HS2 and for the travelling public, there will be more delays and unhappyjourneys. I suspect if Brunel was around today, he would put his foot through his hat. Thank you, Norman. David Cameron will formally present his proposals for European Union reform at a summit in Brussels today. It’s the first time the issue of renegotiating Britain’s membership has been put before all 28 EU leaders. But the summit will be dominated by two other issues - the Mediterranean migrant crisis, and the possible Greek default. Our Political Correspondent Ben Wright reports from Brussels. This report contains flash photography. Another European leader for David Cameron to convince. The Bulgarian Prime Minister had his chance to hear David Cameron’s plan for a new deal between Britain and Brussels. This is the first time re-negotiation of our position in Europe is on the agenda. It is an opportunity for us to kick off the negotiations. We have got the green light to move forward and the key areas we want to negotiate that are of concern to the British people. Every EU leader will have talked to David Cameron by this evening. The first time Britain’s plan for a re-negotiation and referendum has been on the formal agenda. David Cameron’s wish list will not be on the table tonight and no deal will be done, but the EU is likely to say technical talks between officials can now get underway. This is the crisis that will dominate discussions at the summit. Today a Swedish coast cod boat arrived in Sicily with nearly 500 rescued migrants on board. Leaders are trying to work out how to stop the flow of migrants to Europe and what to do with them when they are here. It is thought 127,000 migrants and refugees have entered Europe from North Africa and the Middle East by the sea so far this year. 62,000 have ended up in Italy and more than 63,000 in Greece. While many will remain in those countries, thousands more will continue travelling across Western Europe. The French police believe there are in excess of 3000 people in temporary camps in Calais. The EU is trying to find a way to disperse a migrants more fairly between countries. The UK opted out of a programme to share the burden. David Cameron might have to compromise to get the deal he wants it is important for David Cameron that to make sure what he is asking is in the interests of the other member states. This will maximise the success he will have. EU leaders meeting here will have huge problems. The future of Greece, and immigration crisis and now the task of finding an answer to Britain’s Europe question. None will be easy to solve. In a moment we’ll get the latest from Athens, but first to Brussels and our Europe Correspondent, Chris Morris. The talks with Greek’s leaders and creditors continue. It does not seem as though a deal is getting closer? Not much progress made this morning in a meeting between the Greek Prime Minister and the leaders of its credit institutions. The Greek issue threatens to overshadow this summit. It is not supposed to formally be on the agenda, but time is running out. Eurozone finance ministers are meeting at the moment. It was supposed to be a meeting at which Greece and the creditors had reached an agreement and they would sign of a deal. What seems to be happening is the creditors will go in with one piece of paper and say, he is the best deal we have got. The Greeks or Ben stand up with another piece of paper with a different deal entirely. The political golf is widening by the day. Let’s speak to Christian Fraser who’s in Athens. How is all of this uncertainty going down where you are? Anxiety is reflected in the morning newspapers. A picture of Christine Lagarde dunking a pensioner. It is the sense the Greeks are drowning in austerity and higher tax payments. There is a long tunnel with some light at the end of it, but we’re nowhere near that at the end of it. Two different documents being presented to the euro zone but it is this one from Christine Lagarde that is the focus. The point to make, even though the creditors have made some concessions today, there are things in that document like higher VAT for the islands which will not the junior partners. Even if they get a document that the Greek Prime Minister is willing to give two parliaments, there is no guarantee he will get it through. Thank you both very much. There’s been a sharp rise in the number of prosecutions for rape and domestic violence against women and girls, in England and Wales. There were more than 107,000 last year, up by 16,000 on 2013. Much of the increase is down to people abusing victims over the internet, but it’s also thought people are now more confident about coming forward to report crime. Here’s our Home Affairs Correspondent, Daniel Sandford. This was only in hospital in February last year after her arm of boyfriend stabbed her and repeatedly kicked her in the head. Seen together before the attack, jason Smith wasjailed for 14 together before the attack, jason Smith was jailed for 14 years and Zoe has become a campaign against domestic violence. It is right, two women a week die at the hands of an intimate partner. I wasn’t aware of those statistics obviously before it happened to me. I have immersed myself in domestic violence now and I am shocked and horrified that system so archaic, or this day and age we should be doing more about this. Between April last year and April this year, there were more than 107,000 prosecutions for domestic violence, sex crimes and so-called honour crimes. 78,000 people were convicted, also sharply up. The successful conviction rate for rape was 59.9%, which was slightly down. The sharp rise of cases coming to court with things like domestic violence and rape is being welcomed by prosecutors. They say it does not necessarily reflect an increase in the number of these crimes being committed, but more likely an increase in the number of women reporting them. One new trend prosecutors have noticed is abusers are using the Internet. Christian pretended to be a female oh per on Facebook and then raped a prospective employer he had arranged to meet. People may use social media as an avenue to commit abuse, but it leaves a trace so it gives us good evidence to prosecute cases. As well as targeting women using the Internet, men are using social media like Twitter to harass them. Abusers co-opting cyberspace is another weapon to ruin their victims’ lives. The UK’s population has risen by almost half a million between 2013 and 2014. It’s now at a record high of 64.6 million people. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics the increase is due largely, to the high number of migrants coming to Britain. Our correspondent, Andrew Verity, is with me. Take us through the figures. If you look at the rise in population, it is nearly half a million, 491,100. There are two main FAQ is driving it, and that is the natural growth in the population. More people being born and dying and because of that the population rose by 226,200 people. Forthe the population rose by 226,200 people. For the first time for two or three years we have net migration being larger than that of the population. These numbers afterjune 20 14th it rose population. These numbers afterjune 2014th it rose again significantly after that so we have net immigration driving significant increases in the population. The light it economic growth, one of the puzzles has been although the economy is growing, the economy per person is growing, the economy per person isn’t growing so fast. GDP per capita, the economy divided by all others is below crisis levels because of the rising population. Fighters from the so-called Islamic State have launched an attack on the Kurdish town of Kobane, on the border between Syria and Turkey. Suicide bombers were used in the assault and there are reports that at least 30 civilians have been killed. Injanuary, Kurdish forces backed by US led airstrikes scored a major victory by winning the battle for Kobane against IS. Here’s our Middle East correspondent, Quentin Somerville. The footage is silent, but even from a distance the tremendous force inside Kobane can be felt. This was just the beginning. Kobane was alight and under attack. IS fighters began an assault from inside the town from a number of directions. The news eventually came that all of the attackers had and captured or killed. IS may have infiltrated Kobane by hiding among refugees returning across the Turkish Syrian border. Others may have used Kurdish uniforms as a disguise. Kobane’s liberation took five months of heavy, Street to street fighting. This was the town that IS promised would fall in only days of the West swore to protect. In the end it was air strikes from the coalition that made the difference. I visited immediately after IS were defeated. The devastation was breathtaking. Tens of thousands have since returned, but little has been rebuilt, much of the town still looks like this. Islamic State crows in its propaganda videos, but in recent weeks they have lost ground in northern Syria. But they are far from beaten. This attack this morning, was going on and be launched an offensive in the East. Dozens of people injured in Kobane were treated across the border in Turkey. This attack shows Kobane still matters to the Islamic state in the Kurds inside the town are still determined to resist. There’s to be a review of the UK’s spending on foreign aid projects. It follows a report in The Sun newspaper that thousands of pounds have been spent on things like a game show in Ethiopia and a project looking at the carbon footprint of the Dakar cross country Rally. The Foreign Office says the review will mean a ""crackdown on projects that can’t show tax-payers’ cash is being spent wisely."" Here’s our Political Correspondent, Chris Mason. Welcome to eight games show with a difference. Mrs Ethiopian television and a quiz programme to raise awareness of the importance of drinking milk. This was partly paid for by the American government. The British government, with our taxes, has funded something similar. It is bonkers. I think most people would be horrified to see how much taxpayers’ be horrified to see how much taxpayers’ money is wasted on utter nonsense. It probably doesn’t come as a great surprise to many others, who say much of the overseas aid budget has been wasted over many years. Also paid for by the Foreign Office, a project to measure the carbon foot cars footprint of the Dakar Rally. A statement said the Foreign Secretary has ordered a review to ensure that every last penny of the aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money. British aid has helped get more than 10 million children into school over the last three years and it’s helped 43 million people have access to clean water and sanitation, we think is worth paying for and British people should be proud of that contribution. Politically spending on aid raises questions for some because it’s guaranteed. The government has committed to spending 0.7% of national income on aid every year, at a time when plenty of other budgets around here in Whitehall have been squeezed. Some will argue spending money on games shows like this does matter and other governments do it because they promote values and influence. But others say simply it’s a waste of money. Our top story this lunchtime. A £38 billion modernisation plan for Britain’s railways will cost more and take longer. Network Rail says the plan was too ambitious. And still to come: We’ll have the latest on day three of the Queen’s state visit to Germany. Later on BBC London: After a year as the town without a centre, work begins to rebuild Bracknell. And from book bag to briefcase - could primary school children soon be doing work experience? The Queen is in Frankfurt, on the third day of her state visit to Germany. In a speech last night, she highlighted the need for European unity, saying division was dangerous. Let’s cross to Frankfurt and our royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell. Yes, I tell you one thing, this visit is getting blanket coverage in the German media. Front-page pictures, pages of news in all the main newspapers. This has an entire front page given over to the Queen and the headline, we love you, ma’am, and it’s fairto and the headline, we love you, ma’am, and it’s fair to say that people here are really rather fascinated by the Queen. She embodies qualities which the Germans admire, according to British diplomats here. Above all, of course, a sense of duty. She also brings a bit of mystique to the position of head of state which B good ITI8I’Iy GâI’ITI8I’IS SEEITI to âI’IVy. All of which means that Germany is really rather taken with Britain’s Queen. They regard her as a long-time friend. Older Germans still remember her first state visit in 1965. NEWSREEL: Nearly 100,000 people gave her an ecstatic welcome. It was then just 20 years since the Second World War had ended. Germany had been divided as a consequence of that war. NEWSREEL: The most dramatic minutes of the whole tour were spent in visiting the wall. The Queen was taken to see the Berlin Wall, separating the West from the then Soviet controlled East. It’s said that that visit in 1965 did much to assure Germans that the wartime enmities were over. 50 years after that first visit, the Queen attended a state banquet given in her honour by Germany’s head of state, President Gauck. Germany’s head of government, Angela Merkel, who doesn’t normally attend such functions, was a guest. So too Britain’s Prime Minister, David Cameron. They heard the Queen speak of Britain’s commitment to the continent of Europe and of the need to avoid the terrible mistakes of the past century. We know that division in Europe is dangerous and that we must guard against it in the West as well as in the East of our continent. That remains a common endeavour. Alongside the serious message there have been lighter moments. Here’s what happened when the Queen was introduced to a robot. The robot waved. Bowing is beyond it by the way, because it falls over. Not even the Germans have mastered that. But as they red carpeted whole streets one thing is plain. Die Queen is a success - a big one. Now, tomorrow by contrast will be more sombre. As her personal request, the Queen is visiting the site of the former concentration camp at Belsen, liberated 70 years ago by British forces. That’s tomorrow. The number of children living in poverty in the UK remains at around 2.3 million, the lowest level since the mid-1980s. Labour called the statistics ""depressing,"" but the Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, has told MPs progress is being made. Here’s our social affairs correspondent, Michael Buchanan. The day here at Reevy Hill Primary in Bradford starts with a free breakfast. The school is in one of the city’s poorer areas and both children and parents welcome the help. I’ve got seven children at home, so to us that’s a box of cereal or a loaf of bread a day. You could be saving up to £10 a week. Today’s figures have defied experts, who thought recent benefit changes would mean child poverty was rising. A child is said to be in poverty if they are in a household with an income of less than 60% of the national wage, living on under £272 a week. 2.3 million children are considered to be living in poverty - the same as last year. Campaigners were surprised but remain fearful. It’s good that child poverty hasn’t gone up but of course it hasn’t gone down either and that’s what we need to see if we’re going to achieve the target of ending child poverty. And of course, with all the tax credit cuts and benefit cuts coming down the pipeline, we still expect that child poverty will rise. Child poverty started falling in the 1990s dramatically for several years. Since 2011 it’s remained broadly at the same mark. But that still means that 2.3 million children are living in poverty in the UK. And remember, the government has a legally binding commitment to eradicate the problem by 2020. Ministers said higher than expected employment levels and direct tax cuts had helped keep the numbers down. I believe that today’s figures demonstrate that if you deal with the root causes of poverty - and I believe this government is doing that - then even under a measure of poverty that I have consistently over the last few years described as flawed, you can still have an impact. Being above or below a certain income figure might not mean much to any particular child but it does allow the government to argue its many welfare reforms are not pushing more children into poverty. The former leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady, has admitted that an internal inquiry into one of the church’s most notorious paedophile priests, Father Brendan Smyth, took place under a ""shroud of secrecy"" to ""stop the good name of the church from being destroyed"". He was giving evidence at the inquiry into institutional physical and sexual abuse in Northern Ireland. Let’s speak to our Ireland correspondent, Andy Martin, who’s in Banbridge. This is a startling revelation. What more did Cardinal Brady have to say? Cardinal Brady’s leadership of the Irish Catholic Church was haunted, really, by clericalsex abuse. He retired last year, but that was too late for many victims of paedophile priests, who felt he should have retired some years ago, when the BBC revealed he had taken part in a secret internal church enquiry in 1975, in which two victims of Father Brendan Smyth were interviewed and sworn to secrecy, not only that some of their parents were not informed they had been abused at all. Father Brendan Smyth went on to abuse for a further 13 years. Cardinal Brady went on to lead the church in Ireland and became Archbishop of Armagh. Today, he spoke of his regrets, spoke of the context of the time and said there was a lack of understanding in early 1970s. there was a lack of understanding in early1970s. He early 1970s. He said the need of secrecy to protect the church was deemed paramount he conceded he had asked inappropriate questions of the Victim Support line, which suggests they were at fault, and offered an unreserved apology to the victims. In the last few minutes we have been told by a victims’ In the last few minutes we have been told by a victims’ group they will sue the Irish police force, who was we learned yesterday at this enquiry, had been aware of Father Brendan Smyth’s paedophilia 1973. -- in 1973. Two-year-old Tessa Evans was born with an extremely rare medical condition that means she has no nose or sense of smell. Now she’s having ground-breaking surgery to change her appearance, with the help of a 3D printer. Chris Buckler has the story. Tessa is two. Energetic, enthusiastic and like any other healthy girl. Except she was born without a nose. They had never seen a baby like Tessa. Nobody in the hospital had. So I know that it does create a huge amount of panic when you’re faced with something that nobody has dealt with before and that there’s no handbook for. There are thought to be fewer than 50 recorded cases of what’s known as complete congenital arhinia in the world, and Tessa isjust one of two children in the UK with the condition. To help her breathe while she eats she was given a tracheotomy as a baby. Effectively providing another airway in the absence of a nose. And work has begun to change her appearance. If you look closely you’ll see a small bump. It’s the first in a series of implants that will eventually lead to her looking like she was born a nose. The eventual goal is when she’s in her late teens and she’s fully developed they will put in the final implant, bring the tattoo artist to create shading with indentations for the nostrils and there will be a profile like she has a nose. It is difficult as a parent to balance the cosmetic aspect of it with how you feel society is going to react and the worry that somebody will make fun of her. And this is the technology that’s key to the operations. A 3D printer. A scan of Tessa’s head allowed an implant to be created in a machine similar to this and as time goes on gradually larger implants will be made and fitted under her skin. And technology is developing beyond the cosmetic. Already there are more advanced machines printing living tissue. The speed things are moving forward and interest in different research groups that I see, I’m hoping in five or six years’ time you’ll see a functional nose for Tessa. For the moment the operations won’t give Tessa nasal passages. She won’t have a nose that would allow her to smell or breathe, but that won’t stop her having a full life. If we had known whenever she was born that one day she would be bouncing on a trampoline with her older brothers and sisters and laughing and running and causing all sorts of mischief, it would have changed everything. We would have cried a whole lot less and worried a whole lot less. And if anything Tessa being a little different is something that her family now celebrates. Time for a look at the weather.

But because we have increased humidity, we have picked UP increased humidity, we have picked up the fog. It’s around the Isle of Man, limiting the temperatures.

It will be a feature of the weather for 24 - 36 hours. It’s already with us in the north and the West, as is some rain. There could be showers in the dryer slot across northern Scotland. The rain will creep into western parts of England and Wales. For most of us, dry, bright, some sunshine around. A refreshing sea breeze around the coasts. 24-25 C in land. There are high levels of polymer gain. Not as high further north. We have the cloud and rain to dampen things down -- high levels of pollen again. There are heavy bursts of rain as it crosses the Irish Sea, the sea fog returns, fog in land and it will feel muggy, an oppressive night. ",,

Good evening. It was only last year that a £38 billion government plan to overhaul Britain’s ageing rail network got underway. But today the Transport Secretary said parts of that plan were to be delayed or cut back - blaming Network Rail for being ""too optimistic"" about completing the works. It means the electrification of lines will be - in his words - ""paused"" on the Midland Mainline and Transpennine routes. But it will go ahead as a priority on the Great Western line, which runs from London to South Wales. Here’s our business editor, Kamal Ahmed Weary WÃafy PBSSEFIQEFS closures. Overcrowding on trains, rebuilding stations that causes quay cross. To the long litany of Britain’s rail woes can be added a new entrant, the five year plan to bring our largely Victorian railway into the 21st century will be delayed. I asked the Transport Secretary why the ambitious project announced a year ago are going back to the drawing board. Iam year ago are going back to the drawing board. I am disappointed drawing board. Iam disappointed I can’t see all those improvements as quickly as I wanted. But I am really proud we are investing 38-and-a-half billion in Network Rail, through Network Rail and lifting the railway infrastructure in this country. Today’s rail changes are certainly significant. The whole £38 billion modernisation programme will now be reviewed. Electrification of the great western line to Swansea will remain a priority. But a similar project for Midland Mainline will be delayed. As will electrification of the trans-Pennine express. What will the changes mean for passengers? ? Leeds people o use the trans-Pennine express weren’t impressed. I think we should be treated to the same things as everyone else, particularly in the south. The service is OK, but it could be better. I think a fully electrified line would be better than the old diesel trains. line would be better than the old dieseltrains. Passenger diesel trains. Passenger groups pointed out that the public was already digging deep the use the railways. We are paying more and more fares each year, and part of that was the expectation that there would be improvements on the infrastructure of the track, so as to enable the trains to be more punctual and reliable. This all comes down to who runs the railway. Well, that is the job of Network Rail. And the Chief Executive told me that there was a need for some straight talking. I think over the last year, it has become oven that the challenges of maintaining the rail which are significant. So we, it is time I think to level with the public and say some of the projects, these extraordinary projects that we need, are going to take longer and they are going to cost more than we originally thought. This is Brunel’s famous great western railway running through Bath. It was built over 150 years ago. It is listed and that is why making any changes here cost a huge amount of money. It is a similar story across Britain, and that is why upgrading Britain’s railways is going to cost a lot more and take a lot longer. Industry sources have told the BBC that the Government was warned a year ago, that the plans were at risk, a claim the Government denies. What is the solution? Network Rail’s chairman has gone, and a review of the five year plan will be published in the autumn, when finally, maybe, passengers will be told just how good their railways are going to be. ~ Iam here I am here at King’s Cross Station with some of the 4.5 million customers that use the railways every day, there has been something of a blame game going on today, who is to blame for the problems? Network Rail certainly has missed some of their target, but they would say that those targets are simply too numerous. Here is part of the five year plan, there are three thousand targets in this OK document. Network Rail will hope the review that will be accomplished in the autumn will bring down that number of targets to a more management level. EU leaders meeting at a summit in Brussels have been discussing how to respond to the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe. More than 100,000 have crossed the Mediterranean in the first six months of this year alone. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said containing illegal migration was the priority, but that countries should accept their fair share of genuine refugees. Our Europe editor Katya Alder reports. Europe is in chaos, and the cause is migration. Italy and Greece say they are bursting at the seam, their neighbours are slamming the borders shut. Hungary threatens to build a wall and Germany says it is choking on asylum applications. This is supposed to be the European Union. But it looks a lot like every country for itself. Existing EU migrant legislation is clearly inadequate. Hot on the heels of the economic crisis, no European leader wants this as their problem. Migration and how to significantly reduce it will dominate talks at this EU summit and attitudes are hardening. Today, we have no consensus among member states, Today, we have no consensus among memberstates, on member states, on mandatory quota, for migrants. But at the same time the voluntary scheme cannot be an excuse to do nothing. TRANSLATION: Obviously for Italy, and for Italians this is notjust about a discussion in this building. Migration is a daily issue for us and I am confident of getting the Italian voice heard. A world away from leaders’ sharp suits and limousines thoughjust a from leaders’ sharp suits and limousines though just a couple of miles down the road is this Brussels asylum centre, a reminder that migration and its complications reach every corner of this continent. This man is trans from guinea. He said he has no papers and is running out of hope. All of his friends here have spent years in Belgium, trying and failing to claim asylum. We have heard powerful individual stories here today, but the fact is these people’s requests for asylum have been refused. Like the majority of failed asylum-seekers in Europe, they are refusing to leave, many of them choosing to sleep on the streets or in abandoned houses instead. EU leaders are anxious and under pressure, they want to find a way today to return paperless people as they are known here, back to their home countries much faster. Even as EU leaders discuss new migrant measures many fear they are playing a doomed game of catch up. The destitute from all over the world are desperate to come the Europe. These migrants arrived in Italy in their hundreds this morning. It is an issue that pits EU ideals of solidarity against the economic and social concerns of its individual countries. Well, the other big issue at the summit is the ongoing talks on the Greek debt crisis. Greece needs to agree a deal with its main creditors to stop it going bust by the end of the month, but talks ended today without agreement. Katya is in Brussels - are we any closer to a deal? Well, it is not really looking good, is it. Yet another meeting between Greece and its creditors collapsing and they are not bothering to meet again tomorrow, while EU political leaders are still in town. This just four days before Greece has to pay back the IMF more than 1.5 billion euros. Following today’s talks there were a lot of pessimistic noise, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is known to be very keen for Greece to stay inside the eurozone, but she and her Finance Minister were totally in sync when they said things appeared to be moving backwards. At the end of day the only people who know what are is going on are those inside the meeting rooms. On the surface it looks like all hopes for a deal with Greece are collapsing, but, this could bejust Greece are collapsing, but, this could be just the final stages of complex negotiations with Greece, a lot is at stake, and the deal with Greece could yet go either way. Well, as if there wasn’t enough going on in Brussels, David Cameron will later formally present his proposals for reform of the EU - the first time he’s done so before all 27 other European leaders. The Prime Minister has called tonight’s talks a ""significant milestone."" But the BBC has learned that he accepts it may not be possible to change EU treaties before the referendum on Britain’s membership, due by the end of 2017. Our deputy political editorjames Landale has been following the Prime Minister as he sets out his plans. For four weeks David Cameron’s criss-crossed the Continent, shaking hands, making the case for EU reform. All in preparation for the moment tonight, when Britain’s referendum finally makes it on to the formal agenda, at an EU summit. Today marks a significant milestone in the process of saying it is right for Britain to have this renegotiation and this referendum to address the concerns that the British people have about Europe and make sure that British people have the final say about whether we stay in a reformed European Union or leave. Even as late as this morning, the Prime Minister was still pressing the flesh with leaders he had yet to see. But what EU leaders ask, what the entire EU establishment asks is what does David Cameron really want? They know he wants to cut benefits for EU migrant, opt out of closer union, have more protection from the eurozone, but they don’t know the detail. Are you willing to give David Cameron what he wants on reform? What does he want? He wants to curb migrants’ benefits, he wants to have great epowers for national Parliaments. Will you give David Cameron the reforms he wants? Today’s Europe’s biggest players were silent about Britain’s future as they arrived. Their minds perhaps on the migration crisis or the problems facing the eurozone, but the man who will oversee the reform negotiations was cautious about Mr Cameron’s dehas been. -- negotiations was cautious about Mr Cameron’s dehas been. -- demands The fundamental values of the European yurn are not for sale, and they are non-negotiable. Few leaders were non-negotia ble. Few leaders were prepared non-negotiable. Few leaders were prepared o pick a fight We are ready to listen to David Cameron’s ideas and proposals, and let us take it from there. Over dinner later tonight, Europe’s litres are expected to talk about his plans collectively for the first time and ask officials to begin technical discussions of the detail. Any progress he makes in Brussels may be overshadowed by these scenes of illegal migrants smuggling themselves into Britain. Pictures some tourists fear it will be hard to convince voter it is working. Few wanted Britain’s possible exit from the EU to be the subject of their discussion, but they can’t avoid it now. ~ Iamjoined by I am joined by Nick Robinson. That acceptance by David Cameron that there may not be treaty change before a referendum, how is it likely to go down? The answer to that depends whether you trust the Prime Minister to deliver a fundamental change in Britain’s relationship with the EU or whether you don’t trust him. Because this issue of whether the treaty’s changed, the laws change, in other words, notjust an agreement not just a bit of paper but something that can be changed in court. That is fundamental to what the Prime Minister says he wants to do. If you are generous you say of course it BFE gâI’1âI’oUS YOU Say ofcourse it WGS are generous you say of course it was going to take a long time for every country in Europe to change that treaty, to change those law, and all David Cameron is doing is accepting that that might not be all over, before we get to vote in a referendum. If you are less generous, and you don’t trust him, you say this is a post dated cheque. This is a promise ofjam tomorrow, it is a ratting on a promise. You voted for man who told you that you would get a renegotiation, a treaty change, and a referendum, and now you are being told you will get the promise of a treaty change one day. In a party that has all sorts of worries about Europe as the Conservative Party does, that is likely to get nerves jangling. Thank you. The UK’s population has risen by almost half a million between 2013 and 2014. It’s now at a record high of 64.6 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, the increase is due largely to the high number of migrants coming to Britain. More than 580,000 migrants arrived - many more than the 320,000 people who left. A man has been found guilty of attempted murder, after he attacked an Asian doctor in a supermarket with a machete, claiming he wanted to avenge the death of Fusilier Lee Rigby. The judge at Mold Crown Court said 26 year old Zack Davies, who had links with far-right groups, was ""an incredibly dangerous young man."" Hywel Griffith reports. Calm and collected. This was Zack Davies seconds before he launched a brutal, racist attack, using the hammer and machete hidden brutal, racist attack, using the hammerand machete hidden in hammer and machete hidden in his rucksack.

Davies said he chose him because of his race, not re-I think onand said it was in revenge for the death of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Today his family said they believed Davies was guilty of more than attempted murder. We are no doubt that this should have been rightly defined as an act of terrorism. By his own admission, the defendant, Zack Davies, had extreme neo-Nazi views and is a member of a white supremacist organisation. Sarandev Singh Bhambra was singled out because of the colour of his skin. These postings on YouTube show Davies’ fascination with the far right. They have been taken down. Before the attack he had been searching the term ""beheading"" online. Inside the store he ran after him shouting- online. Inside the store he ran after him shouting - white supremacy, this is revenge and for Lee rig bi. Davies was only stopped when a former soldier intervened and convinced him to put down his weapons. After his arrest he told the police he had become desensitised to violence. A dangerous individual. Not many people go out carrying a machete and hammer and randomly attack a person completely unknown to them H The judge described Davies as an incredibly dangerous young man and warned him to expect the longest-possible sentence.

A controversial flagship GM wheat trial has failed after more than £2 million of public money was spent on the project. The so-called ""whiffy wheat"" experiment took five years to develop and was designed to create a genetically engineered crop that wards off pests by releasing a scent. Our correspondent, Claire Marshall, is at the site in Hertfordshire. Well, this little plot of land is where the battle over Britain’s GM food future is being fought. We found out today the first crop planted here didn’t do what it was supposed to do, but already, despite that and despite all the opposition, there is another one now in the ground. You can see it there beneath these nets. Opponents say none of this is worth the money. Not the welcome you might expect at a science lab. We were given access to the site where the first field trials of GM crops in the UK took place. Quite a lot of security. Oh, yes, indeed. Now destroyed, this so-called whiffy wheat was modified with peppermint genes to repel insects. In the lab, it worked. Planted out, and it didn’t. Great scientific inventions and that is what we really need. Sustainable food production don’t come easily. You have to do a lot of work. You have to do a lot of trials and a lot of errors. At what price? This is why the trial site is now a fortress, almost £2 million was spent on security - three times the cost of the actual experiment. So, what do local farmers think? Howard Roberts farms organically. Will Dickinsons doesn’t. This is a field of organic milling wheat. Mr Roberts respects the science, but believes its focus should change. I think it is a very, very dodgy policy to actually think GM is the cure-all for all the world’s food problems. It might turn out, five, ten years down the road, that it is part of it. It will never be all of it. just down the road and the sun is shining on the crops of the conventional farmer. But Will Dickinson is looking for aphids. Quite often they end up on the ear. This is what they’re doing to his bean crop. He cares deeply about the environment but feels that to earn a living he needs to use pesticides. If I can grow a crop that is less susceptible to aphids, by whatever means, wouldn’t that be a brilliant thing? There’s been a setback, but the GM food science marches on. The next experiment is already in the ground. It’s a different GM crop with new properties and the same controversy. Claire Marshall, BBC News, in Hertfordshire. Teenagers should be getting an hour’s exercise a day. But new figures suggest a mere 8% of girls aged 13 to 15 are meeting that target. For boys it’s not much better- just 14% are doing an hour a day. Here’s our Health Editor Hugh Pym. These young teenagers certainly love their sport and exercise. They are at a north London college, and one of the sponsors is Tottenham Hotspur Football Club but they admit many of their friends don’t think the same way. They told me, there are many rival attractions, including football games. My friend didn’t play a lot of sports. They kind of have their views. They respect my views of sports but they personally don’t enjoy it. Some of my friends do go on their computer and phones when they get home and then do the same thing every single week. For me, I’m not going to say I’m the best in the world, I haven’t earned that yet but it is not going to stop me from trying to earn that but I think there is not enough people that have that mentality. Figures today for England showed a decline in young people taking exercise. The recommended daily amount is an hour a day but only 14% of boys at age 13-15 in 2012 were meeting that target. For girls the figure was just 8%, both down significantly from four years earlier. The local council here is now working on an action plan. What we are pledging to do today is to review all the no ball game signs across the council, to see if we can change the environment to encourage children to be more active and to play. Today’s figures also underline the scale of the obesity challenge facing young people, with more than one-third of ten and 118-year-olds said to be obese or overweight, a proportion which has been steadily rising. -- ten and 11-year-olds. Doctors say big children often become big adults at risk of diabetes and other problems, storing up problems for the NHS. With this cohort of enormous children, if not ebees children coming through into adult #4d, we are facing enormous problem both for clinical care, we will spend a great deal more money in hospitals in the future because of this one problem, notably of obesity. It is a problem which has cast a long shadow over the life chances of a young generation. These teenagers are active. Many others aren’t and they are eating the wrong things. NHS chiefs say it is an urgent priority. They are found in only one place on the planet- now the lemurs of Madagascar face extinction due to the duel threats of being hunted and also deforestation. A leading expert has warned that, as a result, there could be none left in the wild within the next 25 years, as our Science Editor, David Shukman, reports. Our first sight of some world’s most adorable and vulnerable animals - the Lemurs of Madagascar - which only live on this remarkable island. As we are filming, we spot a baby. A poignant image of an infant with a highly uncertain future. Their numbers are now so low, they aren’t easy to find. We try to approach them. At one point we hear the cry of a family of lemurs, marking out their territory. I never expected to get so close. This is the largest of the lemurs in Madagascar. There are 106 different species, but nearly all are in trouble and this is one of the most critically endangered. The lemurs face some serious threats. The forest they depend on are being cleared for farmland, in a country that’s short for food. The effect is to turn the landscape into what looks like the aftermath of a war zone. Of Madagascar’s original forest, less than 10% is left. I would believe that within the next 25 years, if the speed of the deforestation is the same, there will be no forest left. That means no lemurs left on this island. And there is another threat. This lemur hasjust been shot and hangs down the back of a hunter. Lemurs are being killed and eaten. This video captures the painful moment that a baby lemur is abandoned after its mother was killed. In this desperately poor country, many people see lemurs as food and as the population grows, demands for what’s called bush meat is rising. The best hope lies in the schools. And children who’ve been taught about lemurs as part of an awareness campaign, want to save the animals. For the kids to attended the awareness camps, they are now thinking that they would be happy to see lemurs, they wouldn’t be eating lemurs and they would be very sad if the lemurs would be disappearing. A community project making honey. Local people are encouraged to earn a living in ways that don’t involve cutting down the forest or hunting lemurs. A new technique to increase yields of rice - another incentive to make money without harming the wildlife. But these initiatives are small scale. And what matters for the lemurs is that despite many bold attempts to save them, the pressure on the last-remaining pockets of forest can only intensify. Let’s find out what the weather is doing now. Warm again in the sunshine. 25 at Heathrow. Warmer than it has been recently in the north of Scotland. A lot of cloud moving north, bearing rain. So it will be a dull and damp night across Scotland.

Good evening and welcome to the programme. I’m Victoria Hollins. A man who stabbed his neighbour more than thirty times has been convicted of her murder. Trevor Gibbon had waged a campaign of harassment against Alison Morrison after initially complaining about the noise from her son’s skateboard at their home in Harrow. Gibbon went on to trap Mrs Morrison in her car - he carried out the killing just a day after he was handed a restraining order. Tarah Welsh reports. Alison Morrison was the sort of woman he would want as a neighbour. She was much loved and a very special person. She worked tirelessly to provide for her family. Two meter was to love her. She was such a powerful person, such a positive person. -- She was such a powerful person, such a positive person. -- to meet Alison was to love her. She was murdered by the man who lives next door. Shortly after the family moved here, their next-door neighbours began complaining about noise. The Morrison family try to make peace by Trevor Gibbon continued. It was continuous harassment, day in day out. He would try one tactic for a month and then changed his tactics. He would bang his dustbin lid ex AM and trapped Mrs Morrison in her vehicle. The family say he blighted their lives for three years. Five days before she died, she made a written statement about what she described as the unending harassment of her family. She says she had had to install CCTV cameras and make video and audio recordings before she was taken seriously. She said it got so bad that she couldn’t sleep properly and felt it would never end. Trevor Gibbon without you the other harassment. When his neighbour left for work the next morning, he was waiting armed with two nights. He attacked and stabbed her 33 times. Alison Morrison lay on the ground with multiple stab wounds. She was finding it difficult to breathe but managed to say over and over again, Trevor Gibbon did this to me. When the first paramedic arrived, she assured Mrs Morrison that she was -- that she would save her. Alison said, no, you’re going to lose me. She died in hospital later that morning. We were asking for Alison and someone just We were asking for Alison and someonejust shook her We were asking for Alison and someone just shook her head. I started screaming no. I thought it might not be true. But it was true and it’s been a nightmare ever since. But she never wake up. You think about how she died and how brutally she was murdered. Itjust brings everything back. What she must have been going through, what must have been going through her mind. How scared she was. Trevor Gibbon will be sentenced next week. Forthe Trevor Gibbon will be sentenced next week. For the family, the pain goes on. In a statement, who teenage son said his life had fallen apart in a statement, who teenage son said his life had fallen apart since his mum died and his heart breaks every day. Lots more to come, including: He’s a straight A student but can’t get funding for university because of his immigration status. Should the rules be changed? Ten years on from the 7/7 bombings and are hundreds of Londoners still suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder without even knowing it? Experts say 300 people were treated for the condition after the attacks in 2005, but it’s possible many others - never traced - were affected. Now a new scheme is being developed which will mean that in future anyone who witnesses a terrorist attack will get treatment. Gareth Furby reports. Imagine you’re walking through London and the unthinkable happens. Somewhere in the distance, there is an explosion and by the time you get closer, there is nothing to be done, the emergency services are already there, so you walk on thinking life will continue as normal. But you could be wrong. You’re seeing something that you’ve never seen before, you’re totally unprepared for. Professor Chris Bruin is an expert on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and says, for some people, that experience can be life-changing. The sense that they are still very on edge and in danger, so people who are looking over their shoulders when walking down the street. It happened to hundreds after the 7/7 bombings. The authorities had contact details for about 900 people. 600 were screened, and about half of those had symptoms which required treatment. I suffered very badly with lack of sleep and with flashbacks. I guess I withdrew from the world somewhat. Ben was on a tube train near Edgware Road station. When a bomb detonated on the train on the track nearby, killing six people, he wasn’t injured but realised later he needed treatment. About a month after 7/7, I travelled into work in London and the train I was travelling on stopped exactly where we stopped on the day of the attack. I got to work that day and told them I couldn’t do it anymore. I just couldn’t face the stress of being on the tube each day. I was very lucky that my local GP gave me grief counselling and that went on for five or six weeks, and then I had a course in London which probably went on for a couple of months. But some others who witnessed the aftermath of these events may not have had treatment. We don’t know how many additional people might be out there who we haven’t been able to find. Certainly, with the bus bombing, hundreds if not thousands of people will have walked past the scene of that before the emergency services were able provide an effective cordon. How many of them will be affected, I wouldn’t like to guess. It will be a significant number. But how might it work now if there was another attack? Last weekend, London’s emergency services were testing their response to a simulated rail crash. And survivors were being directed to a special reception centre. This would be somewhere where people who don’t necessarily require hospital treatment can go, we can provide them with the support they need. Public Health England is also making a new Internet-based site for use if there is another attack, where people who have not been picked up can register themselves. The experts hope this will mean treatment gets to more who need it, and for those who’ve never had PTSD treatment since 7/7, and think they might benefit, the advice is to contact your GP. Six police officers in Essex are facing criminal inquiries for allegedly failing to properly investigate reports of child abuse. The Police watchdog the IPCC says, in total, 25 serving staff and four former employees are involved. The force has apologised to victims and says changes have been made in procedures. I would say to the victims and their families that Essex Police are now thinking very hard, have all the safeguarding things being done that should have be done? And even more importantly, the perpetrators in these cases, the alleged perpetrators, have they been pursued as vigorously as they should be? I think that all of that should be a reassurance to families. Boris johnson has offered an olive branch to black cab drivers after a turbulent few weeks during which he was filmed swearing at one. The mayor has been at loggerheads with the black cab industry, both overthe Uberapp, and reducing the age at which drivers have to retire their vehicles. But now he says he’ll look again at the plans to lower the 15 year limit. Here’s our Political Editor Tim Donovan. You think London cab drivers -- a huge display of protest today directed at the French are a lot big Uber app, directed at the French are a lot big Uberapp, bringing chaos directed at the French are a lot big Uber app, bringing chaos to part of the city. -- Uber app, bringing chaos to part of the city. -- the French part of the Uber app. Uberapp. On the Uber app. On the face of Uberapp. On the face of it, a simple celebration 100 and it did signal him desperate to end hostilities, with a U-turn on getting drivers to replace their taxis after ten years instead of 15. They have said it would help in the short term, to get them over the hump. There are huge amounts of money needed. It’s fair and it’s part of the process of endless improvements in London. Isn’t thisjust bowing improvements in London. Isn’t this just bowing to a noisy interest group, favouring them other people’s health? No. We have a scrappage scheme to get all taxi operators getting their vehicles on the road. It was this colourful late-night exchange of words which brought the row to wider attention. Relations have been barred from months, as the complaints intensified about the Uber app and its impact on the lives -- intensified about the Uber app and its impact on the lives -- on the trade. No concession on the Uber app today but the mood has brightened. We are very keen to support this and we -- We are very keen to support this and we -- this is the way to do it. By introducing subsidies, by introducing the scrappage schemes, very quickly, by 2022, 60% of the vehicles on the road are going to be zero mission capable. In his last two months in office, this was not a fight he wanted to continue. Protestors have spent the night inside Ealing maternity unit, which is due to close down next week. Campaigners marched to the hospital yesterday to coincide with the last planned birth at the site. The hospital says the closures will mean more medical staff will be able to carry out one-on-one care for local women. The capital’s transport chief, Sir Peter Hendy, has announced that he is leaving his job to take on a new post at Network Rail. As the company’s new chairman, he will oversee over 2,500 stations across the country and take on the biggest programme of upgrades London Underground boss Mike Brown will step into his shoes as interim Transport for London Commissioner but is widely expected to get the post permanently. Emmanuel is a straight A student with a place to study science at Imperial College. But he might have to give up that place because his immigration status means he can’t get a student loan and so he can’t afford to go. But now he’s hoping a legal challenge at the Supreme Court could change that - and the educational prospects of many more immigrants in London. Helen Drew explains why. Hundreds of immigrants who were lawful residents in the UK aren’t eligible for student loans. Some who may have lived here most of their lives, the immigration status means they can’t borrow money to help fund university. This includes Emmanuelle, originally from Ghana and has lived in London since he was nine years old. With 38 at a level, he has got a place to study chemistry at Imperial College. But he can’t afford it. I can’t explain the words. Seeing all of your friends goes university, seeing the pictures of what they’re doing, stories. Then you arejust the person here who can’t contribute in any kind of way. It’s quite heart-wrenching. hea rt-wrenching. The government change heart-wrenching. The government change the rules on this a few years ago. Before 2012, students could get the same loan as UK applicants if they had what’s known as discretionary or limited leave, which Emmanuelle has. But that state now won’t get you a loan. Since 2012, only students who have indefinitely to stay in the UK are eligible, and that’sjust one step away from citizenship. Now the Supreme Court has been hearing a case for change. One charity estimates this could help 600 students every year. The vast majority of whom are here in the capital. We think it should be changed because these young people are the towns of the future. They will be here in the UK if we can loan them the money to help them get on their way. I think it is really beneficial to society. It’s a small amounts that the -- to society. It’s a small amounts that the -- for the government is prepared to what they are -- that the -- for the government is prepared to what they are -- compare to what they are prepared to do. Someone who has been in the country for most of the life and has been through the British education system, I don’t see why I should be stopped from settling my potential. The government say they are waiting for the courtjudgments, given a few weeks. -- which is due in a few weeks. Still to come: Why Tom Daley is going to be selling his swimming trunks. The director of Bend it Like Beckham tells us about its journey from screen to stage. Children in primary school should do work experience. That’s according to a report commissioned by London Councils. It says young people need better advice and more exposure to different jobs. It calls for every young Londoner to complete 100 hours of work experience by the age of 16. Here’s our Education Reporter, Marc Ashdown. It was a case of what’s myjob at City Hall, today, as schoolchildren tried to guess the careers of six volunteers. Careers advice itself has been patchy in schools. This report says every child should have 100 hours of work experience by the age of 16. Like Amal, here, who swapped school for a week at a recruitment firm. It’s not just photocopying and making cups of tea. Spreadsheeting, I sat into a couple of interviews, being in a phone interview. I’ve media-monitored. Not just cups of tea. No cups of tea. It helps employers to make sure school leavers are fit for work. It’s all about being prompt and on time, how to dress, even simple things like how to use Microsoft Office Outlook, that we take for granted. Primary school children will also get some kind of advice, more to sow the seeds for work rather than set them towards a specificjob. All this is a welcome improvement. Since 2012 when the government made schools responsible for their own careers advice, many have struggled. Careers in schools has been pretty non-existent in the past few years. It has been done on a shoestring budget. This sort of thing taking off around the country would be brilliant. We have a big challenge, but in every disaster, there has to be a recovery plan. This is all about getting the message out to young people and their parents that we need to start having conversations about jobs, about learning, about work. When I finish school, I want to be a doctor. A barrister. Midwifery. This promotional video shows children do have the imagination to go on to create things, theyjust need the spark to inspire them. The project has the full backing of the Mayor. Be careful, Boris, they’ll be after yourjob. The former President of the USA, Bill Clinton has been visiting Haggerston School in Hackney today. The President recognised the work of 500 volunteers who work in schools with children from deprived backgrounds. The volunteers are part of the City Year UK charity. Two of their volunteers said they were inspired by his words. It showed me how much he understands what we do, and from what he said, he said we are creating an alternative model for the future and that rarely resonate with me because it makes me happy about what we do. It’s really exciting. I thought it was fantastic. It’s a pleasure to hear him speak. It shows that what we’re doing here is a big impact. We know Tom Daley as the poster boy for the London Olympics. Since then, he’s had continued success in his sport of diving. 18 months ago, he announced that he was in a relationship with a man. Now for the first time, he’s become a patron of a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender charity and will be speaking at an event this evening at the Waldorf Hotel in Central London. Wendy Hurrell is there. Final preparations are under way for the 1+00 guests who have been invited here. It’s the great undergoes of the gay community. It will be to listen to people like Tom Daley and performances from people like Alesha Dixon, to rename and rebrand a charity which has been going for 1+1 years will stop this is what they do. Since the phone started ringing in 1971+, the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard has spoken to an estimated 3 million people. When people seem very connected through apps and the Internet, to actually pick up the phone and speak to a real person is absolutely vital, I believe. We get all types of calls, from people who are coming out, people who want advice on sexual health, sexuality, gender identity. Or people just want to have a chat. People are still isolated and they just want to hear, what we call, calm words when they are needed most. 160 trained volunteers who identify as gay, lesbian, bi and trans run the phones around the clock. They were there in the ‘70s as the capital gay scene took off. It’s a deadly disease and there is no known cure. A leading source of information about HIV and AIDS in the ‘80s. Three died and more than 130 others injured. And in 1999, answered hundreds of calls following the nail bomb attack on the pub in Soho. So now it’s time for a new name. They’re now called Switchboard, the LGBT+ Helpline. It’s a new error and with a new patron. Runs Olympic medallist, Tom Daley. -- patron. Runs Olympic medallist, Tom Daley. -- it’s a new era. It’s the first time you have become a patron for an ODBC charity. Having someone to talk to about coming to terms with sexuality, gender identity, anything like that, having questions and having it all locked up inside your head is stressful. It weighs you down. To have someone to talk to is something I’ve been lucky to have. Supportive friends and family, but some people aren’t lucky. Switchboard offers a service that is confidential. They don’tjudge anybody. You canjust pick up the phone and talk to them. One time saying about Laos can take away a lot of stress. Is crucial in this day and age to have that kind thing. And if you don’t feel comfortable talking on the phone, there is also e-mail and talking on the phone, there is also e-mailand instant messaging. Being able to talk to someone just makes things easier. And funding is important charities. You will be selling some of your things? Yes, I think some of my swimming trunks are up for auction. Hopefully we will be able to raise lots of money because of the great cause. It is saving lives because being able to talk to people, is going to help reduce the suicide rate within the community. And you become a bit of a role model. I have to ask our training is going through next year. It’s going really well. In three weeks, we leave for the World Championships which are our best chance to qualify for the pics. That’s what I’m relieved focusing on. The big picture is the Rio Olympic Games. My dream is to win an Olympic gold medal so I’m doing everything I can to get it. LO might well done for becoming involved in this charity. It is also 9aY involved in this charity. It is also gay pride this weekend, so it’s all going on. Guests and arriving. Thank you. With England women doing well in the World Cup, it’s a good time to open UP World Cup, it’s a good time to open up West End musical celebrating women’s football. Bend it Like Beckham is a stage adaptation of the movie that launched the careers of career night -- movie that launched the careers of career night -- the career of Keira Knightley. Ball skills and dancing meets musical theatre in the stage adaptation of the hit film, Bend it Like Beckham. The story of the football loving Asian girl, torn between her passion and family obligations, allow the directory to revisit the storyline while tackling new challenges. There was no point in doing a musical version of the movie unless we completely embraced musical theatre. We had to really put our heads into that space and not really think about the movie. I think the final production is the movie in some ways, but not in other ways. I think it is it’s own thing. You don’t have to have seen the movie to enjoy the show. It stands on its own. The 2002 film made stars of Keira Knightley and her mentor nigra. This cast decided not to watch the film portrayed the original actors. I was too nervous. I was too nervous to speak to Kira. We didn’t want to watch the movie because we didn’t want to steal what they had done. You wanted it to be a very, although it is based on the movie, it’s a different piece of work. The actors have all-- have had to develop a whole new set of football skills. We have both been in training. Someone from Tottenham Hotspur has been training us. She helps us become comfortable with it. It has taken ages. We are offering something that looks and feels like a traditional West End show. It’sjust coming from a slightly different cultural point of view. The music is culturally a bit different. The people on the stage a bit different. At its core, it is certainly representative of Britain in the future. They plan to invite anyone’s women’s World Cup team to see the production, but you can spectate from your own seat until October.

167,BBC1 London,25-jun-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten: The biggest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times is to be slowed down. The five-year £38 billion plan is being revised - some of it put on hold - amid mounting costs and endless delays. I’m disappointed that I can’t see all those improvements as quickly as I wanted. But Labour alleges that ministers have known about the scale of the problem since last year. We’ll have the latest. Also tonight: In Brussels, David Cameron accepts it may not be possible to change the EU’s treaties before the UK referendum. Anxiety in Athens - another day of talks on resolving the debt crisis comes to nothing. Guilty of attempted murder- a man with links to far-right groups who attacked a shopper with a machete. And the plight of the endangered lemur - a special report from Madagascar. Tonight on BBC London: The mother brutally stabbed to death by her neighbour in Harrow. A TV engineer is found guilty of murder. And ten years after 7/7, could Londoners still be suffering post traumatic stress disorder? Good evening. The Government’s £38 billion plan to modernise the railway network is being reviewed. The programme was said to be ‘overly optimistic’ and major elements of it are to be put on hold. The Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the blame lay squarely with Network Rail, which should have anticipated the problems. But Labour and the rail industry have both accused the Conservatives of knowing about the difficulty since last year. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, reports. Weary passengers facing rail closures, overcrowding on trains, rebuilding stations that causes chaos. To the long litany of Britain’s rail woes can be added a new entrant, the five-year plan to bring our largely Victorian railway into the 21st Century will be delayed. I asked the Transport Secretary why the ambitious projects announced just a year ago are now going back to the drawing board. I’m disappointed that I can’t see all those improvements as quickly as I wanted. But I’m really proud that we are investing £38.5 billion in Network Rail. Today’s rail changes are certainly significant. Up to a fifth of the £38 billion modernisation programme will now be reviewed. Electrification of the Great Western Line to Swansea will remain a priority. But a similar project for Midland Mainline will be delayed as will electrification of the TransPennine Express. What will the changes mean for passengers? In Leeds, people certainly weren’t impressed. I think we should be treated to the same things as everyone else, particularly in the South. The service is OK, but it could be a lot better and I think a fully electrified line would be better than the old diesel trains. Passenger groups pointed out that the public was already digging deep to use the railways. We are paying more and more fares each year and part of that is the expectation that there would be improvements on the infrastructure, the tracks, so as to enable the trains to be more punctual and reliable. This all comes down to who runs the railway. Well, that is the job of Network Rail and the Chief Executive told me that there was a need for some straight-talking. It’s time I think to level with the public and say some of these projects, these extraordinary projects that we need, are going to take longer and they are going to cost more than we originally thought. This is Brunel’s famous Great Western Railway running through Bath. It was built over 150 years ago. It’s all listed and that’s why making any changes here costs a huge amount of money. It’s a similar story across Britain and that’s why upgrading Britain’s railways is going to cost a lot more and take a lot longer. Politicians love unveiling a rail improvement. But I have been told by senior industry sources that the Government was warned a year ago that the plans were already at risk, a claim ministers deny. What is the solution? Network Rail’s Chairman’s gone and a review of the five-year plan will be published in the autumn when finally, maybe, passengers will be told just how good their railways are going to be. |,m I’m here at King’s Cross Station in North London with some of the 1+.5 million passengers that use Britain’s railways every day. There’s been something of a blame game going on today between the Government and Network Rail. Certainly, Network Rail has missed some of its targets. One document from the five-year plan has 3,000 targets, it is nearly 1,000 pages long. Network Rail will hope that when the review is published in the autumn, some of those targets will have been made more manageable. Thank you. At the European Summit in Brussels, David Cameron has presented his plan to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the European Union. It’s the first time he’s been able to explain his approach to all EU leaders. BBC News has learned that he has accepted it may not be possible to change the EU’s treaties before a referendum is held in the UK. Our deputy political editor, james Landale, reports. They used to call it ""shuttle diplomacy"". David Cameron’s Chris-crossed the Continent, changing hands, eating dinners, making the case for EU reform. All in preparation for the moment tonight when Britain’s referendum finally makes it on to the formal agenda at an EU Summit. Today marks a significant milestone, really, in the process of saying that it is right for Britain to have this renegotiation and this referendum to address the concerns that the British people have about Europe and to make sure the British people have the final say about whether we stay in a reformed European Union or leave. Even as late as this morning, the Prime Minister was still pressing the flesh with leaders he’d yet to see. What EU leaders ask, what the entire EU establishment asks is, what does David Cameron really want? They know he wants to cut benefits for EU migrants, opt out of ever-closer union, have more protection from the Eurozone. They don’t know the detail. For months, the Prime Minister’s argued these reforms would need a change to the EU’s treaties before a referendum. But the BBC’s learned he is now arguing for a legally-binding commitment that EU laws will be changed some time in the future. Are you willing to give David Cameron what he wants on reform? What does he want? He wants to curb migrants’ benefits, he wants to have greater powers... Will you give David Cameron the reforms he wants? Today Europe’s biggest players were silent about Britain’s future as they arrived, their minds on the migration crisis, or the arrived, their minds on the migration crisis, orthe problems facing the Eurozone. But the man who will oversee the reform negotiations was cautious about Mr Cameron’s demands. The fundamental values of the European Union are not for sale and non-negotiable. Today, we are ready to listen to David Cameron’s ideas and proposals. Over a dinner thatis ideas and proposals. Over a dinner that is still going on, Europe’s leaders are expected to talk about Mr Cameron’s plans for the first time and ask officials to begin technical discussions about the details. Any progress Mr Cameron makes in Brussels may be overshadowed by these scenes of illegal migrants smuggling themselves into Britain, pictures this week that some Tories fear will make it harder toen co-Vince voters the EU is working. So tonight in Brussels, the talking continues. Few wanted Britain’s possible exit from the EU to be the subject of their discussions. But they can’t avoid it now. james Landale, BBC News, Brussels. Eurozone finance ministers have failed in their latest meeting to find a solution to the Greece debt crisis. There’s still deadlock between Athens and its international creditors. Greece will default if it fails to make a 1.6 billion Euro debt repayment by next Tuesday. Talks will resume on Saturday, but Germany has warned that the talks are going backwards. Let’sjoin Gavin Hewitt in Athens for the latest. It is worth noting that these negotiations have been going on for five months. There have been ten meetings of the Euro Group. There is no disguising the huge frustration, there is some bad blood. Today, there was muttering about betrayals from both sides, but what is interesting, despite all of this, all parties believe it is still possible at the 11th hour on Saturday that they might stilljust be able to put a deal together. Greece is a country in waiting, watching deadlines come and go. Yet again today, they heard there was deadlock. There is a strange calm here, when a default and bankruptcy could be days away. Tonight, there were protesters on the streets, insisting there should be no deal with the blackmailers from the EU and IMF. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, was leading the negotiations in Brussels. He insisted they had already offered to increase taxes, but their creditors wanted him to go further, so stalemate. Although Alexis Tsipras believes compromise is still possible, but differences clearly remain asjeroen clearly remain as jeroen Dijsselbloem clearly remain asjeroen Dijsselbloem accepted. We are very, on a number of issues, quite far apart. The main concern raised by the IMF is that Athens is putting too much emphasis on raising taxes rather than spending cuts, so further weakening an already fragile economy. âCOI’IOITIy. If economy. If finally there is a deal, it will have to win approval from the Parliament in Athens. Prime Minister Tsipras has little room for manoeuvre. In the Parliament, go into the MPs’ cafe and the talk is of how many from the Prime Minister’s own party might not back him. Any deal the Prime Minister signs up to will be one that will win the support of the MPs, insists this man, the Interior Minister. TRANSLATION: I’m not optimistic, the glass is half-empty. There are many like this lawyer, who fear what might happen if there is not agreement by next week and Greece defaults. If Greece was to leave the EU, I would feel I have no future in this country. If Greece leaves the Euro, it would be very difficult for me, for my family, for my children. You know, we will manage somehow. The problem for Alexis Tsipras is that he came to power promising to end austerity, but those who have loaned Greece money insists Athens must make reforms in exchange for further bail-out funding. So, there will be more behind-the-scenes negotiations tomorrow with an eye to meeting yet another deadline, when Eurozone Finance Ministers gather on Saturday. If there is failure then, questions will be asked about what will happen with the financial markets and the banks on Monday morning. Gavin Hewitt, BBC News, Athens. The other main issue on the agenda at today’s EU Summit was the ongoing migrants’ crisis. There’s been no agreement on the idea of quotas for sharing the burden of relocating migrants across the EU. At least 153,000 migrants have tried to enter the EU this year. Our Europe Editor, Katya Adler, is in Brussels. Is there any hint of an emerging consensus here or not? Well, this had supposed to be the main topic of discussion, but leaders have ended UP discussion, but leaders have ended up chewing over the debate at dinner. It won’t have been a relaxed affair. This is an emotionally-charged issue. The tone has hardened considerably over the last couple of months. Back in April, the images of migrants dying in the Mediterranean, the EU leaders said saving lives was their number one priority. The President of the European Council said sending illegal migrants back home was the main focus. Existing EU migration legislation isn’t working and the result is chaos on the streets of Europe. We have Italy and Greece who say they are bursting at the seams and their neighbours threaten to slam the borders shut. When it comes to the migration debate, it seems to be every country for itself. A man with links to far-right groups who attacked another man with a hammerand a machete in a supermarket in North Wales has been found guilty of attempted murder. Zack Davies targeted Dr Sarandev Bhambra in a racially motivated assault, apparently as revenge for the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby by Islamist extremists in London. Our correspondent Hywel Griffith reports. Calm and collected, this was Zack Davies seconds before he launched a brutal and racist attack, using the hammer and machete hidden in his rucksack. The police were called as Zack Davies chased a young British Sikh around the aisles, hacking at him and shouting white supremacist slogans. Dr Sarandev Bhambra was struck repeatedly. He cut through his skull and nearly severed his hand. Davies says he chose his victim because of his race, not religion, and said the attack was in revenge for the death of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Today, Dr Bhambra’s family said they believed Zack Davies was guilty of more than attempted murder. We are in no doubt, given the racial and political motivations, that this should have been rightly defined as an act of terrorism. By his own admission, the defendant, Zack Davies, had extreme neo-Nazi views and is a member of a white supremacist organisation. Sarandev was singled out because of the colour of his skin. These postings on YouTube show his fascination with the far right. Before setting off for the supermarket, Zack Davies had been searching the term ""beheading"" online. In the store, he ran after his victim, laughing and shouting, ""White supremacy! ""This is revenge and this is for Lee Rigby."" Zack Davies was only stopped when a former soldier intervened and convinced him to put down his weapons. He told the police he had become desensitised to violence. A very dangerous individual. There are not many people that will go out carrying a machete and hammer and randomly attack a person completely unknown to them. The judge described him as an incredibly dangerous young man and warned him to expect the longest possible sentence. The population of the UK has risen by almost half a million in the year to 2011+, according to the latest figures. There are now 61+.6 million people living in the UK. More than 580,000 migrants arrived and net migration, the difference between the numbers coming and those leaving, accounted for more than half the population growth. And the latest figures show fewer teenagers in England are getting the recommended hour of exercise a day. just 8% of 13 to 15-year-old girls and 11+% of boys of the same age are reaching the target. A report into South Africa’s worst massacre since the end of apartheid has criticised the police, saying they should have done more to prevent the bloodshed. President Zuma said tonight that officers involved in the shooting of workers at the Marikana mine should face a criminal investigation. 31+ miners were killed in August 2012, as our Africa editor Andrew Harding reports. This was the moment a violent industrial dispute turned into something much worse. South African police shooting at a group of striking Marikana miners in August 2012. Today, the commission of inquiry into these killings has finally released its report, President jacob Zuma presenting a summary on national television. The Marikana incident was a horrendous tragedy that has no place in a democracy, where all citizens have a right to protest and where workers have the right to go on strike peacefully. The report clears the South African government of any blame, but comes down heavily on the police. Senior officers failed to plan or to control their forces. At least one injured miner died because there was no first aid. The police, known here as Saps, then lied to the official inquiry. The Saps members should accept that they have a duty of public accountability and truthtelling, because they exercise force on behalf of the South Africans. Nearly three years later, there is nothing to mark the spot here where those first miners were gunned down. The police then gave chase to others who were trying to hide behind those rocks. They killed many more there and to this day, not a single policeman has been arrested or charged. But that is certain to change now. The commission did criticise mining unions for provoking conflict, but said the police should face criminal prosecutions. As for the British-owned Lonmin mine, open again now, it too shares some blame for mishandling the strike. Many hope the Marikana killings will be a catalyst for change here. There’s not much sign of that yet. Andrew Harding, BBC News, South Africa. The Syrian town of Kobane has come under fire again The first funerals have been held for victims of the Charleston shootings in South Carolina. Nine people were killed in the attack last week. Tomorrow, President Obama will travel to the city to pay his tribute to the church’s pastor who was among those killed. The reaction to the shootings has encouraged people to reconsider powerful but controversial symbols from the past including the Confederate flag, as our correspondent Nick Bryant reports. Across the water from the site of the Charleston massacre is where the opening shots of the American civil war rang out. A landmark on the southern heritage trail, Fort Sumpter was where the Confederacy achieved their first victory and where they stubbornly repelled union forces for most of the war. It’s the American flag that flutters here today, but there are many who would be happy to see Confederate colours flying from these empty masts. It’s like part of the southern blood. Leave it alone. It’s about liberty, it’s not about hate. It has nothing to do with what happened here in South Carolina. But many disagree, and think the Confederate colours should be a museum piece. I understand that the South has a strong feeling for the flag, but it’s time for the South to move on. The killings have brought about a reckoning notjust here in Charleston and South Carolina, but across the American South, and an extraordinary rethink about how the states of the old Confederacy commemorate their history and remember their past. We have seen more attitudinal change in the last seven days than the last 20 years. It’s these images that have completely transformed the debate, the killer, Dylann Roof, brandishing the Confederate flag and vowing to start a race war. Black campaigners have long protested that these battle colours are a symbol of slavery and therefore stained with hate. But this week, white Southern politicians have also demanded their removal from South Carolina’s capital. Major retailers have also stopped selling the flag. What is this? That’s a privacy fence, high enough so that we won’t see the Confederate flag. But in this black community, residents now want the flags banned completely. For years, their white neighbour has flown civil war colours and although she switched to a Confederate flag known as the stars and bars after the shooting, it still causes offence. Years ago, they erected barriers to block the view. It’s a slap in the face, is what I feel. I feel it’s a slap in the face for any black American that walks the street. Today saw the first funerals of victims of the shootings in a city and region that has been changed by the violent deaths. Often in American history, it’s taken racial atrocities to bring about reform. The awful events in Charleston fit within that narrative. Nick Bryant, BBC News, South Carolina. The lemur is a primate native only to the island of Madagascar, and it’s facing extinction, partly because of hunters and partly because of the process of deforestation. A leading expert has warned that there could be none left in the wild within the next 25 years, as our science editor David Shukman explains in the second of his reports from the island. Our first sight of some of the world’s most adorable and vulnerable animals, the lemurs of Madagascar, which only live on this remarkable island. As we’re filming, we spot a baby, a poignant image of an infant with a highly uncertain future. Their numbers are now so low that they aren’t easy to find. We try to approach them. At one point, we hear the cry of a family of lemurs, marking out their territory. I never expected to get so close. This is what is called an indri, the largest of the lemurs in Madagascar. There are 101 different species, but nearly all of them are in trouble and this is one of the most critically endangered. The lemurs face some serious threats. The forests they depend on are being cleared for farmland in a country that is short of food. The effect is to turn the landscape into what looks like the aftermath of a war zone. Of Madagascar’s original forest, less than 10% is left. I believe that within the next 25 years, if the speed of the deforestation is still the same, there will be no forest left. That means no lemurs left on this island. And there’s another threat. This lemur hasjust been shot, and hangs down the back of a hunter. Lemurs are being killed and eaten. This video captures the painful moment that a baby lemur is abandoned after its mother was killed. The best hope lies in the schools. Children who have been taught about lemurs as part of an awareness campaign want to save the animals. So the kids who attended the awareness campaigns, they are now thinking they would be happy to see lemurs. They would not be eating lemurs and they would be sad if the lemurs would be disappearing. A community project making honey. Local people are encouraged to earn a living in ways that don’t involve cutting down the forests or hunting lemurs. But what matters for the animals is that despite many bold attempts to save them, the pressure on the last remaining pockets of forest can only intensify. David Shukman, BBC News, in Madagascar. The distinguished broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough has been on a visit to the White House at the personal invitation of President Obama. The president, who is said to be a great admirer of Sir David’s work, wanted to discuss the future of the natural world, as David Sillito reports. An invitation from the White House is special enough, but this, being told that the president wants to discuss the future of the planet with you, and that in this TV interview, he will be asking the questions. Sir David Attenborough, as I was saying in our walk over, I’ve been a huge admirer of your work for a long time. Life can still throw surprises, even when you’re 89. There! The blue whale is 100 feet long. And the reason? Barack Obama grew up watching Sir David, the natural world’s great communicator. He wanted to talk about conservation, climate change, the need for global solutions and the hope that the next generation will do more than the current one. The interesting thing is that my daughters, Ifind, Malia and Sasha, who are 16 and 13 now, they’re much more environmentally aware. They do not dispute, for example, the science around climate change. Well, I’ve never met a child... Who’s not fascinated? Who’s not interested in actual history. just the simplest thing, a five-year-old child turning over a slug and says ""What a treasure!"" Kids understand the natural world and are fascinated by it. The question is, how did anyone lose the interest in nature? So after 60 years of broadcasting about the natural world, a chance to tell the most powerful man on the planet how to save it, face-to-face. David Sillito, BBC News. You can see President Obama in conversation with Sir David here on BBC One at 10.30 on Sunday night. The actor Patrick Macnee, best known for playing john Steed in The Avengers, has died at the age of 93.

The Home Secretary Theresa May has arrived in Tunisia to pay her condolences, after the terror attack that’s killed 30 British people. She’s visited the beach at the tourist resort, where a lone gunman indiscriminately opened fire on Friday.

This afternoon on BBC London: Children and teachers return to Essex after the fatal coach crash in Belgium which killed their driver. And from road to river- a water main bursts on a busy road in South London during the rush hour. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. The Home Secretary Theresa May is in the holiday resort of Sousse in Tunisia, paying her respects after the massacre last week by an Islamist gunman, that left 38 people dead, 30 of them from Britain. She laid flowers on the beach at the site of the murders, along with her German and French counterparts, who also lost tourists in the attack. David Cameron says Britain faces an ‘existential threat’ from the so-called Islamic State, that represents ‘the struggle of our generation,' and ‘we have to fight it with everything we can.' We are outside the Imperial Marhaba Hotel where the killings happened. The Tunisian police are hunting possible accomplices of the gunman. They believe somebody gave Seifeddine Rezgui the rifle he used. They believe somebody transported him here to Sousse as well, so they are looking for people who worked with him. They have already interrogated his father and three roommates. Theresa May is here right now, she has been meeting Tunisian security officials and she’s accompanied by the British Foreign Office Ministerjon Brain reports.

I heard what I thought was fireworks. I looked to the left of me and the whole beach was running and it was like a stampede, I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were shots, well from what I know now, as I could see sand flying in the air, and I believe it was bullets hitting the floor and the sand was hitting back, so we ran.

In the wake of the killings here, thousands of British holiday- makers have left Tunisia on evacuation flights. They were laid on by their individual holiday companies. Some British tourists have decided to stay here. They want to show solidarity with the Tunisian people. What’s happened here is a shattering blow to Tunisia’s tourism industry. Every year, 500,000 Britons come here, but after this, Every year, 500,000 Britons come here, but afterthis, how here, but after this, how many will want to come back to Tunisia? Daniel Sandford has this report. Police officers and soldiers with machine-guns mingling with tourists in Tunisia’s beach resorts. The response to the terrifying scenes on Friday and the tragic loss of life. It prompted thousands of people to rethink their holiday plans, many there have come home early, many who were planning to go are rebooking for other destinations. But where? Even Europe’s biggest cities can be affected. Paris was the scene of a shootout with Islamic State supporters in january. shootout with Islamic State supporters injanuary. While some resorts have built reputations for having good security, a growing number of extremists are determined to kill, so nowhere is completely safe. Travel companies base their decisions on where to offer holidays based on advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. That advice is based on intelligence courses. Ministers, police and officials at another Cobra Emergency Committee this morning aren’t significantly changing any travel advice, there is, after all, a threat in the UK, too. We do all recognise that there has been a change in the terrorist threat and some of that propagates itself in the UK. We have been making an arrest a day over the last year. December’s siege in a cafe in Australia when a gunman who claimed to be an IS supporter took customers hostage showed how widespread the problem is. No continent has been untouched in recent years. As the Prime Minister acknowledged on BBC Radio Four this morning. What’s happening here is the perversion of a great religion and the creation of this poisonous death cult that is seducing too many young minds in Europe, in America, the Middle East and elsewhere. This is going to be the struggle of our generation and we have to fight it with everything that we can. Although security has been stepped up to protect British tourists in Tunisia, the Prime Minister was talking today of a full spectrum response, destroying the self-styled Islamic State at its source and tackling its hate-filled ideology. Daniel Sandford, BBC News. As well as the dead, there are the wounded casualties from the shootings here. They are being treated in four separate hospitals in the city of Sousse, many British casualties among them including the most seriously injured, Allison Heathcote, she was shot five times who is critically ill. An RAF C-17 plane will fly into Tunisia to take home to the UK those wounded who can be moved and potentially the RAF will be able to repatriate the bodies of some of the British dead. The Prime Minister says the fight against Islamic State is the struggle of our generation. Our assistant political editor, Norman Smith, is at Westminster. Is there a sense that the attacks in Tunisia might strengthen the case in the Government’s mind for tougher anti-terror laws? Well, Clive, sometimes what is interesting is not what the Prime Minister says and does, but what he doesn’t say and doesn’t do. We didn’t get a rush of new announcements on fresh anti-terror laws, or security clampdowns, or threats anti-terror laws, or security clampdowns, or threats of retaliatory strikes against Islamic State, despite the massacre of 30 British citizens. That reflects a view that this as much about the battle for ideas as it is about security. The Prime Minister compared it to the Cold War and the clash with communism. At the end of the day, that was won not by Western tanks but by Western ideas. The view in Government is that there are no easy victories, there is no quick-fix. This is a long, generational struggle and we have to be patient and resolute and there are in any case a whole host of fresh anti-terror laws that have been introduced recently. We are expecting more in the summer. There have been something like 800 terrorist arrests since 2010, 70,000 pages deemed to contain extremist content have been taken down from the Internet. There is one other factor, Clive, it is this: In the wake of the 7/7 Bombings, you may remember Tony Blair came out with a whole long list of measures to tackle extremism and terrorism. Well, despite that and the headlines they garnered, many of those measures began to unravel. The view in Downing Street is better to have a much more patient and considered response. Norman, many thanks. Banks in Greece are closed today and will remain shut for a week because of the current financial crisis. Customers are also allowed to withdraw only 60 Euros a day from cash machines, though the rules are different for foreign tourists. The restrictions come as Greece’s bailout deal with the Eurozone expires tomorrow, and after the European Central Bank’s decision not to increase emergency funding. Our Economics correspondent, Andrew Verity, reports. Greek banks may be shut today but one door is wide-open, the exit from the Euro. With that prospect close, the Greek government is trying to stem the flow of funds from its banks before they run out of money. If you are Greek and you need more than 60 Euros today, you are stuck. TRANSLATION: Of course we are worried. I’m not so insensitive as to not be worried. TRANSLATION: We are waiting here to draw our own money. This is what we are waiting for. They are keeping us outside. No-one has come out to inform us. On Friday night, Greece called a referendum on new bail-out terms that it doesn’t like. On Saturday, Eurozone Finance Ministers refused to extend Greece’s existing bail-out deal. On Sunday, the European Central Bank refused any further emergency cash for Greek banks, forcing the government to shut banks and restrict cash withdrawals. If they vote no, Ifind it hard to see how that is consistent with staying in the Euro. What we mus dot is make sure that in this eventually, we help and advise British tourists to take money with them when they go to Greece, we help the many British pensioners in Greece and we have to deal with the issue of Greek banks and there is a Greek subsidiary of a bank here in London. The head of the European Commission said he felt betrayed by Greece’s actions but urged its people to vote to stay in the Euro. It is time for Greece’s political leaders to shoulder their responsibility, to tell their people what is really at stake, that it will not be easy but necessary. Share prices dropped sharply this morning, but there was little sign of Greek contagion spreading to Italy or Portugal. The markets will be worried if the situation carries on. They are reassured that the European Central Bank is there to provide cash to the markets and ensure that normality is kept for as long as possible. Tourists should still be able to withdraw more than 60 Euros if they can find a cash machine with funds. Watch carefully in the next few days. Greece is still in the Euro, but onlyjust. In a moment, we’ll get the latest from our Europe correspondent, Chris Morris, in Brussels, but first let’s speak to james Reynolds in Athens. It is day one of capital controls, the banks are shut and folk can only get 60 Euros out of cash machines, how has that gone down? People here are taking it reasonably calmly. Essentially, those banks are in a financially induced coma. This morning, the shutters came down over the cashpoint machines, but in the last few hours, those cashpoints have re-opened, there are small queues down there in the square. Everyone is allowed to take up to a maximum of 60 Euros. I have gone down and tested it with a British bank card and you are able to take UP bank card and you are able to take up to 200 Euros out. Those restrictions do not apply to foreign account holders. I spoke to a number of Greeks who are coming up from the Metro station to work, I asked them where they worked, they said the banks, they had been ordered to go to work in those banks which were closed, but they had been sent in to work. A lot of the Greeks have been weary and not shown any signs of panic. We can cross to Brussels. We heard the Euro commission president say he felt betrayed by Greece. That does not suggest there will be a meeting of minds before tomorrow when Greece house to stump up 1.5 billion to the IMF. I have never heard a president of the European Commission use such undiplomatic, blunt, angry language about a member state. He suggested he had no trust left in the Greek Prime Minister and accused him of lying to his people. He said in his proposal put forward there are no pension cutss, make ats in wages, although that is debatable because many pensions overhaul would go down over the terms of the proposals put forward. The overall message was this, and it was put bluntly. If you vote yes in a referendum to the proposals, we will do everything to help. He said if you vote no, it would be a no to Europe and in other words you probably would be kicked out of the euro. Thanks to Chris and james. Our top story this lunchtime: The Home Secretary visits the scene of the attack in Tunisia to pay her respects to the 38 people who died, and to talk to the country’s security services.

The Labour peer Lord janner will face prosecution for historical child sex offences after all. Earlier this year the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, decided against going to court, saying his dementia meant he was unfit for trial. But following a review requested by alleged victims, it’s now felt to be in the public interest that criminal court proceedings will take place. Lord janner has always denied the charges. Our Legal Affairs Correspondent Clive Coleman reports. Lord Greville janner, for decades a prominent MP and Labour peer. In April it was decided he would not face criminal proceedings on 22 allegations of historical sexual abuse against nine children because he has dementia and he is unfit to take part in a trial. His alleged victims were furious. But today, legal history tinged with humble pie? Alison Saunders has become the first DPP to have a major prosecution decision reviewed and overturned. Any regrets? I took that decision very carefully at the time and the victims’ right to review process has been undertaken and it decided it was wrong and we should accept it and I have endorsed and accepted that position. That means a judge will now decide if the peer is fit to stand trial. If he is, he will. If not, he will face a trial of the facts, meaning a jury will hear evidence from alleged victims and decide only if Lord janner, who has always denied any wrongdoing, committed the physical acts of abuse. They will be able to make a finding of guilt, but no conviction. --not be able to find. Despite that, the alleged victims are pleased. This is all they ever wanted - to be heard in court and for there to be some sort of finding of facts and for them to be believed. So, this today has restored their faith. Alison Saunders faced calls to resign following her original decision not to prosecute. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, I asked if she would go now. I don’t think it is a decision to resign over. It is a decision I made carefully and with the victims at the heart of that. That is why we talk about the victims’ right to review and that is why we are here today. Alison Saunders’s words won’t satisfy some supporting the victims. I will raise questions in Parliament about the suitability or not of Alison Saunders as the director of public prosecutions. After a very public episode of legal discussions played out at the highest levels of the Crown Prosecution Service, criminal proceedings against Lord Greville janner will commence finally here on the 7th of August. While proceedings against Greville janner move to the courts, the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions originally happen, will face scrutiny. Alison Saunders has been seen as a victims’ champion that when you are the DPP, you are ahead of what is known as the nation’s law firm and you make a call this big in a case so sensitive, and there is so much sensitivity in the deeds ofjustice for victims of child sexual abuse and you appear to get it wrong, that looks bad. I put it to her, had she taken the advice of her principal legal adviser within the CBS in making the original decision, she avoided that question, but she did say she had disagreed with the senior independent OC who said it would be in the public interest for Lord janner to face criminal proceedings. If you look at that, it will give her considerable problems. New research suggests thousands of the most severely disabled people in face financial uncertainty, when the Independent Living Fund closes toITIOI’IâoW. At the moment 11,000 people receive Government support worth £260 million a year. But the BBC has learned that less than a third of local councils who’ll take over administering the money, will ring fence funds for those who currently rely on it. Here’sjudith Moritz. With severe cerebral palsy, Mary Woodleigh needs 24-hour care. Her support worker, Erica, helps Mary with everything from eating to washing, even making time for hobbies, like sewing. For 30 years, Mary’s care has been paid for by the Independent Living Fund. Now, though, it is closing and instead the money will pass from central government to local authorities. That has left many of the most severely disabled people and their families uncertain about the future. At present, we do not know where we stand with how much funding is going to come to us for Mary’s care, in what capacity. Like the other 11,000 users of the fund in England, Mary’s needs are being reassessed. Until her new care plan is in place, she will receive the same support. But her family say they have been told to expect cuts. The BBC and charity Disability Rights UK have asked councils what they will do with the money from the government. Less than a third could guarantee the money they receive will be used for those who rely on the current fund. A small number are still deciding, but more than half said they would not protect the money for individual users. Protesters campaigning on the issue tried to get into the House of Commons chamber during last week’s Prime Minister’s Questions. The government has said the changes are not about support being withdrawn, but are part of the debate on how it should be funded. The sun is out, the strawberries are ripe and the world’s best tennis players are already out on court. Yes it’s the first day of the nation’s favourite tennis tournament Wimbledon and top seeds Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams have just started their opening games. Andy Murray begins his campaign tomorrow. Natalie Pirksjoins us now Good afternoon. It is not often I stand here on day one in glorious sunshine promising you a sun-drenched fortnight, but that is what the forecasters are saying beyond the warning of a thunderstorm. The defending champion has kicked things off on Centre Court, Novak Djokovic, currently 2-1 against Philip Cole Schreiber. Those with tickets today are in for a treat. Saxophones in the sunshine means showtime as the crowds streamed in this morning, this was the tranquil scene. The world-famous Wimbledon queue can often resemble a mud bath, but not so this week. Very hot, but still nice. Better than the rain! It is worth it. A gorgeous day. Also enjoying the sunshine is Andy Murray, trading today before his campaign starts tomorrow, rightly one of the favourites stop there are major hurdles to clear, not least Mr Wimbledon, Roger Federer, who has equalled a record number of titles and is coming into the fortnight in great form. And this man, the defending champion Novak Djokovic could eat him in the final and has beaten him in their last eight meetings. The former British number one believes here is where Andy Murray can perform to his best. Djokovic has got the better of him in recent matches but it has been close. On a grass court, with a home crowd, that is his best chance, Andy, he beat him in 2013 here and if he got the opportunity again, I would back him to win. What of the ladies? The defending champion has not made it past the third round of any other grand slam in the past three seasons, but she says her best for Wimbledon. The main threat is in the form of the worlds number one, Serena Williams, if she wins a sixth she will complete the Serena Williams slam, holding all four at the same time. Every time Serena plays a grand slam there is a lot riding on it and it will be interesting to see how she handles that. All 19 tennis courts are packed with action today and everyone playing wishes of the same thing, that this fortnight, the tennis gods will shine on them.

There’s no turning back for the solar-powered plane that’s attempting to circumnavigate the globe. It taken off from Hawaii - bound forjapan - and has now reached the point where it can no longer turn back if it runs into trouble. That means only two options - eithera safe landing, or ditching into the sea. Our science correspondent Rebecca Morelle has more. Taking off from japan, under the cover of darkness. A gentle start to an epic solar powered journey across the Pacific ocean. And there is no going back. These latest pictures show Solar Impulse 2 is well into its flight and if anything goes wrong now, the Swiss pilots would have to bail out into the ocean. It is the point of nonreturn, not only for the flight, for the project. Now, the aeroplane ends up in the water and on the life raft and we are done. Or it reaches Hawaii, and it will be a triumph. At weather has caused two months of delays and forced the first attempt to be aborted, but no one has tried anything like this before. The experimental plane’s vast wings have 17,000 solar cells. It flies without fuel. It is a test of endurance as well as technology. It will take the pilot five days and five nights to reach Hawaii. Strapped into his seat for the duration, reach Hawaii. Strapped into his seat forthe duration, he is reach Hawaii. Strapped into his seat for the duration, he is allowed to sleep for 20 minutes at a time. If he succeeds, it will be the furthest a solar plane has flown, as well as the longest lasting sale of light in aviation history. A loss of solar power coming up? You are right. A lovely start to Wimbledon. Some sunshine and light wind and perhaps into the middle 20s this afternoon. A nice start in southern and eastern parts. Cloudy and Wales. Sunshine coming out in the afternoon. There is a bigger cloud towards the West of Scotland bringing rainfall, but that is about it. I expect it to be dry through the central lowlands. Cloudy in Belfast but it should stay dry until later. Into the low 20s in northern England, with sunshine and light wind. On the south coast, the temperature held back by a sea breeze. Inland, moving up to 24 degrees. The heat will build tomorrow. Humidity is also on the rise and it will get uncomfortable. The risk of thunderstorms particularly midweek. On Tuesday, no pressure to the north and to the West is dragging in a southerly breeze. Hot and humid air drifting UP breeze. Hot and humid air drifting up from Spain and France and crossing the UK, particularly through the middle of the week. Temperatures will ease by Thursday but heat and humidity could return for the end of the week in some areas. On Tuesday, the heat building. There might be a thunder storm or too macro in the South of Scotland, northern England. Elsewhere, Scotland, northern England. Elsewhere, sonny. Into the low 30s in the south-east. On Tuesday night, it will be very warm, humid. That’s 20 degrees for some. A humid night, quite uncomfortable. Humidity lingers and heat humidity will peak in the middle of the week, which could spark downpours. Temperatures will peak to the north of London, up to 34 degrees. Even in the North of Scotland, up to 27 degrees. Temperatures should ease back on Thursday because of a cold front. We get the wind coming in from the south and the West. A little bit fresher through Thursday. The chance of heavy showers in the south-east. Temperatures could be rising again at the end of the week, mainly in the South. The top story. Theresa May is in Tunisia, visiting the scene of the terror attack will stop she has been speaking about security measures. This is a symbol of what is possible and we have had a meeting this morning with my into the minister colleagues. It has shown the determination that we all have to fight against this perverted ideology. That is causing this death and destruction. We are very clear the terrorists will not win. We will be united in working together to defeat them. But united, also, in working to defend our values. That is all from us. Good afternoon, I’m Asad Ahmad. Schoolchildren and teachers involved in a coach crash in Belgium - in which the driver died - have returned to Essex. They were on a trip from Brentwood School when their bus crashed on yesterday morning. Two boys remain in hospital- one with serious head injuries. Here’s Alex Bushill. The kisses and cuddles at the school gate this morning had a particular resonance for a school reeling from events across the Channel, with two of their pupils still in hospital.

And a schoolboy from Essex is out of intensive care after this coach crash in Belgium, which killed the driver. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at 6pm. Police in Tunisia say they have arrested a significant number of people after Friday’s beach massacre. 38 people were killed - most of them British tourists. This morning the Home Secretary Theresa May laid flowers on the beach with the gunmen open fire and called the murder is a despicable act of cruelty. On Friday - exactly a week after the attacks - a minute’s silence will be held across the UK in memory of all those who died. Our correspondent Orla Guerin is in Sousse. Extraordinary footage of the attack as it took place. Confusion and horror at what is unfolding. Hotel staff and tourists following the killer, Seifeddine Rezgui. Amid the chaos, a warning from the employee bravely filming. He moves towards the bar area. In the background the killer, his machine gun clearly visible. He follows the gunman to the beach and is confronted by carnage. A minute or two later the cameraman rushes back towards the hotel. Gunfire erupts again in a side street. This was the firefight in which Seifeddine Rezgui was killed. But not before he claimed the lives of many innocent holiday- makers not before he claimed the lives of many innocent holiday-makers in many innocent holiday- makers in the worst terrorist attack on Britain’s since the London bombings. And at the beach today, heavy weapons on display, but this time for protection. Theresa May arrived with her Tunisian counterpart, shoulder to shoulder the came to pay their respects. The Home Secretary laid flowers in honour of the dead. A sombre moment under a blistering sun. And a moment of unity for two nations brought together by the bloodshed here. The Home Secretary is now here at the scene where are so many Britons lost their lives, we are so many holiday-makers so many Britons lost their lives, we are so many holiday- makers were gunned down. It was about this time three days ago that the attacker was on the loose and the key question for the government of the UK and the authorities here, can something be done to prevent another attack like this in the future? Then, beneath a banner, the Home Secretary and ministers from june ‘s ear, Germany and France promised to fight together against extremism. What happened here last Friday was a despicable act of cruelty. How could a place of such relaxation, beauty and happiness be turned into such a scene of brutality and destruction? Sadly we know that at least 18 British tourists were killed in this terrorist attack but we also know that that number will rise. Back at the seashore it looks idyllic but many are still reliving the moment when terror came to the beach. This British couple on their second honeymoon heard the attack from their balcony. All of a sudden, next minute, firing, it was so loud, it could have been at our hotel. We did not know what to think. I have never heard anything like that in all my life, you see it on the news, in movies, but not in real life. It is just horrendous, frightening. I must say that my heart goes out to the families and the victims, it is awful, it really, really is. Why, why would they do this? For those wounded her help is on its way, an RAF transport plane loaded with medical supplies has left Brize Norton. Soon it will bring the injured back home to Britain newly scarred by hatred and fanaticism. Many of those caught up in Friday’s attacks have already arrived back home. Angela Evans from Kings Lynn was on the beach when the shooting started. She has been describing what happened and how she survived. You may find some of the interview upsetting. I thought it was firecrackers, or fireworks. There was this man there, just stood there, with his huge gun. Moving around all the people, shooting at them. just killing, murdering them. You cannot run, because you were an open target, running, he was shooting anybody on their feet. We both, same time, play dead, we fell, just fell to the ground, faces in the sand. He just kept on shooting. We felt him coming nearer and nearer. Then his feet were at the side of me. Into the sand fell, I can only say part of the gun, a magazine? You still have to pretend you are dead. Put more bullets in, a new magazine in, and the shooting started again. This afternoon a minute’s silence was held in the House of Commons as MPs remembered those who lost their lives in Tunisia. Addressing the Commons, David Cameron said terrorists wouldn’t succeed in changing Britain’s way of life. It holds that mass murder and terror are not only acceptable but necessary. Mr Speaker we must confront necessary. Mr Speaker we must confront this needle with everything we have. We must be stronger at standing upfor our we have. We must be stronger at standing up for our values and we must be more intolerant of intolerance. Our Deputy Political Editorjames Landale is in Downing Street - what more can the government do to prevent such attacks? The government is going to carry on doing what it is already doing, trying to defeat Islamic State and support the creation of stable regimes in the region. But what the prime and it really wants to focus on is trying to tackle the ideology behind Islamic State. What is not clear is precisely how he wants to do that. He is promising more powers to ban extremist groups and individuals but we don’t know when thatis individuals but we don’t know when that is coming. He is promising to give the intelligence agencies greater access to communication on the Internet but that will only be in draft form. In the Commons some people are already calling for top military action, others warning about the threat to freedom of speech. The truth is, this place and around Whitehall, the focus is overwhelmingly on the situation on the ground in Tunisia and only now are mine is beginning to turn to the longer term response to what the Prime Minister says is a generational struggle. Eighteen British victims have now been formally identified but around 30 are thought to have died. Among them - 24 year old Carly Lovett from Lincolnshire - a beauty blogger and photographer who’d only recently got engaged. One family lost three generations - Adrian Evans, his father Patrick and his nephewjoel Richards were dedicated Walsall football supporters. This morning fellow Saddlers fans and friends paid tribute outside the ground. Sue Davey was on holiday with her partner Scott Chalkley. They were both killed. This afternoon Sue’s son, Conor Fulford, spoke to our correspondent Sian Lloyd. ~ I want as many people to know my mother as possible and I know she would hate that, so I am trying my best to try and let people know that we have lost a very special, special person to us. Conor Fulford fought to find out what had happened to his mother Sue David. The A3-year-old had chosen to nausea as a place to relax after buying a home with her partner. My memories are of my mother grinning from side to side, she is looking at me on the camera, saying we are going to Tunisia next week, cannot wait. Two days after arriving they were among the holiday- makers murdered arriving they were among the holiday-makers murdered on the beach. From his home in America Conor stole the headlines on the television networks and began searching for news. Ringing the Foreign Office, nothing. Ringing around, it isjust Foreign Office, nothing. Ringing around, it is just awful. around, it isjust awful. I never knew where my mother was, so with that I thought I’m going to try and do it myself. I got on Twitter, Facebook, hundreds of Tunisian people were messaging me saying do not worry, I will go and look at hospitals for you and your family. Do you feel let down by the authorities? The only word which brings to mind which has been ringing around this house since I got back is abandoned. The family are critical of what they describe as a lack of fumigation from the Foreign Office. They also believe that too much attention is being focused on the gunman. Isis are again getting headlines, Isis this, Isis that. They are claiming they were behind the attack, that seems to be on everybody’s mind and I think the real people living in this country, the real people who have unfortunately passed away seem to get bypassed. Members of the family are leaving for Tunisia in the morning to speak to the local authorities. Their priority is bringing the mother of three and grandmother of two backcombed. -- back home. In Greece - banks have been closed for at least a week - as the country’s financial crisis deepens. There’ve been long queues at cashpoints. New capital controls mean that Greeks are now only allowed to withdraw around EAO of cash a day. European leaders have warned that Athens is putting the future of Europe at risk. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Athens. It could have got the cash from its creditors but rejected the conditions. The Eurozone said the door is still open to Greece, the Prime Minister will speak later but in the meantime Greece can do is wait, worry and demonstrate. Athens is now an anxious city, insecure and alive with rumours. These pensioners heard that banks closed across Greece would open especially for them. They do not have cash cards, they say they don’t know how to use them. They wanted the 60 euros of their savings that Greeks are now allowed to withdraw daily under emergency regulations in the cash-strapped country. Waiting in the midday sun was too much sun. These are desperate times. TRANSLATION: These 60 euros are pointless, you cannot buy anything with them. The austerity measures here are imposed by the house, the European Union. As a pensioner I have not, how can I live with what our creditors have imposed? We phoned the health minister, who is blind, listening to one of their creditors on television. jean-Claude juncker said the fate of the Greek peoples of huge importance to him. TRANSLATION: European policies have been a catastrophe and we are still claiming Greece has been treated as an equal, can only be described as a hypocrite. I was somebody who believed in the European vision but we have 63% unemployment for graduates. Thousands of homeless and huge cuts in the health system. He told me Greece was facing a humanitarian crisis. A crisis in part due to the radical views of the Greek government say opposition politicians. You have to remember all these people are totally ideological against privatisation, free-market capitalism. They believe they want to have a socialist society, so in the mind, what they are doing is in the interest of the people but in reality it is a disaster. Here in Athens it feels like everybody has a strong opinion that they want to share. Tonight it is the turn of the pro-government supporters, tomorrow and the government demonstrators will march. People want to talk about the bank crisis but what you notice her more than anything is a lack of panic. It is more a weary sense of resignation after five years of difficulty and the conviction of whatever happens to Greece now, nothing will improve her any time soon. With events here and in Brussels changing so fast, Greeks anxiously follow every piece of news, knowing what happens to them now will affect the lives of everyone here, young and old. The Foreign Office has warned British holidaymakers heading to Greece that they should take plenty of cash with them as banking services could be limited. Around two million Britons travel to Greece every year. Our correspondent jon Kay reports. Ticket, passport, and plenty of euros. There we go, the cash is ready to go. This family flying this afternoon hoping they have got enough. That is only 1800, but I’ve got some more to be sure. Only I800? I’ve got 900. With their A-levels over, these teenagers are office in Greek sunshine, but they are facing lessons in international economics. I am just lessons in international economics. Iamjust taking I am just taking only cash. The plan is to get safe in the room, and not take a lot of cash out with us, but we have a lot on us, because there is no where to get it out. How much are you taking? 400 each. A lot. What did your parents think about you leaving with a lot of cash? They were happy to have the emergency fund just in case. In theory, when the girls get to Greece they should not face any limits at cashpoint is because the restrictions are not meant to apply to tourists, but with cash running out and some businesses reluctant to take cards, the advice is... Make sure they have travel insurance and a mixture of payment methods, so make sure they have cash and credit and debit cards with them. If you are taking extra cash, you need to take extra care as well. Travel experts say to split the money between different members of the party and put it in a safe in your hotel. Some insurance companies are increasing the amount of cash protection they give to tourists in Greece. This afternoon’s flight left on time. Sunshine is guaranteed, but everything else is less certain. Our Economics Editor Robert Peston is here - how perilous is all this for the Eurozone? It is very tempting because Greece has been in crisis but more than five years to somehow think that if it tumbled out of the Euro it would not be a big deal, after all, the Eurozone has made some preparations for that kind of shock. But it would still be extremely serious because the Euro was supposed to be forever. Once it is perceived by investors not to be for ever, they will start placing bets on which will be the next week economy to tumble out. The borrowing cost in those economies will therefore rise to take account of the risks, and that will lead to a disintegration of the unity of the Eurozone, which could lead, ultimately, to other countries leaving. Now, this is notjust a problem for the Eurozone. The Chancellor, George Osborne, said in the Commons today that he regards a Greek X it is very damaging for the global economy and very damaging for us. You would think in those circumstances that the Eurozone leaders would try to lower the stakes, butjon Ford junker --jean Claudejuncker said that stakes, butjon Ford junker --jean Claude juncker said that the vote for Greeks was notjust about Claude juncker said that the vote for Greeks was not just about the terms of the bailout but whether that the Greeks stay in the Euro, if the Greeks call his bluff and vote to leave next week will be extremely hairy for all of us. The time is 6:20pm. Our top story this evening: The Home Secretary has laid flowers on the Tunisian beach where it’s feared around 30 British tourists died. A number of arrests have been made. And coming up: Later on BBC London: She survived the London bombings and found a new lease of life playing sitting volleyball. Martine Wright looks back. And where are all the women? As Wimbledon gets underway, we’re at the club promoting female coaches. This was the scene outside Lancashire County Council today after campaigners learnt than an application to start fracking for shale gas had been rejected. The energy firm behind it, Cuadrilla, said it was surprised and disappointed by the decision. The application - for a site in Little Plumpton, near Blackpool - was rejected on the grounds of noise and the impact on the landscape. Our Correspondent Ed Thomas is there now. This is where the fracking was meant to take place. The energy firm behind the plants believes there is enough shale gas baleen -- beneath our feet that could power the UK for UP our feet that could power the UK for up to 40 years. The government desperately wants this to happen, and so does the British Chamber of Commerce, but to date the councillors of Lancashire said no. -- today. It was the moment they had waited four years to hear. Lancashire’s county councillors had rejected new plans to frack for shale gas. And this is what it meant to these campaigners. Absolutely electric. Ecstatic. A great decision. Absolutely the right decision. Four years we have been fighting to hear that. What does it mean to me? I think you know what it means to me. But this was the front line in their campaign, Little Plumpton, just outside Blackpool. Lancashire County Council’s planning department said the fracking should go ahead, but under pressure, the councillors said no. There has been an intense campaign against fracking across Lancashire. In 2011, exploratory drilling for shale gas caused earth tremors, and ever since there has been concern over noise pollution and damage to the environment. The government had promised to go all out for shale gas with a regulated industry, and today, the firm that wanted to frack in Lancashire warned that the UK needs to find a home-grown energy solution. The country will end up relying on other people for its energy supply. Now, in a perfect market, of course, there might be nothing wrong with that but the market is one, far from perfect, and two, from the horrible events we have seen in the Middle East and North Africa this week, relying on others for you energy security is fundamentally not a great place to be. And this is not the end. The council’s decision not to allow fracking is likely to be appealed, and the campaigners say they will not go away. Ed Thomas, BBC News, Lancashire. The former Labour MP Lord janner is to be prosecuted over allegations of child sex abuse after an earlier decision not to charge him was overturned. The Director of Public Prosecutions had originally said that Lord janner was not fit to stand trial on health grounds. But an independent review of that decision said a prosecution was in the public interest. Lord janner denies the allegations. Clive Coleman reports. Lord Greville ja na, Lord Greville jana, for decades a prominent MP and Labour peer. In April it was decided he would not face criminal proceedings on 22 allegations of historical sexual abuse against nine children because his dementia meant he was unfit to take part in a trial. His alleged victims were furious. Alison Saunders has become the first Director of Public Prosecutions to have a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned. She had any regrets? I took the decision very carefully at the time and the Victor’s right to review process was undertaken and it was decided we thought it was wrong and I have endorsed the decision. You accept the decision was wrong? I have to put it to you that people ask if you will resign. It was a finely balanced decision and my concern was not just about getting balanced decision and my concern was notjust about getting the evidence, which we had, but we also had to take into consideration the campaign from the claimants wanted. If Lord janner is not fit to stand trial, he will face a trial of the facts. There will be no finding of guilt or conviction and no penalty. Ajury will decide only guilt or conviction and no penalty. A jury will decide only if he carried out the physical acts of abuse. Despite that, the alleged victims are pleased. Paul Miller is not one of the nine in the current case but says he was abused by Lord janner. It is that the victims to get their day in court, to put it across and to hear him face justice. After a very public episode of Will he or won’t he played out at the highest level of the Crown Prosecution Service, criminal proceedings against Lord janner will begin here finally on the 7th of August. Clive Coleman, BBC News, Westminster Magistrates’ Court. Wimbledon got underway today. Andy Swiss watched the day’s action. # Blue skies smilin’ at me. # Today’s Wimbledon forecast, sunshine and spectators, and when it comes to queueing, no wonder is it better. Thousands had played the waiting game. But finally came the grand entrance. The men’s champion, Novak Djokovic, up against Philip Kohlschreiber and, Djokovic, up against Philip Kohlschreiberand, it seemed, the local wildlife in the form of a peckish bird. Kohlschreiber also ruffled a few feathers, but not quite enough. Djokovic safely through in straight sets. It was a similar story for the women’s top seed, Serena Williams who did have the uncomfortable moment but was too strong for Gasparyan. With power like this, she will take some stopping. As for British hopes, the inform johanna Konta faced a tough task against Maria Sharapova, and so it proved. Sharapova easing through to the next round. Butjoy for the home fans arrived in the form of a 21-year-old from Stockport. Liam Broady is ranked just 182nd in the world but he recovered from two sets down to beat Marinko Matosevic. It was a moment of chest-thumping drama. Only the first round, perhaps, but for now, the fans have a new favourite. Yes, but tomorrow it’s all about another British player as Andy Murray begins his campaign. Murray says he is playing as well now as when he won the title in 2013, so we could be in for quite a fortnight. Andy, thank you. Time for a look at the weather with Matt Taylor.

We do have wins of the Atlantic which have been feeding in plenty of cloud to end the afternoon of the parts of western UK and Northern Ireland. We could see outbreaks of rain in the evening, turning persistent across the North West of Scotland and extensive low cloud and sea fog. But it will be a mild night and it will turn muddy in western areas with temperatures around 14 or 18 degrees. You might not need a jacket but you will need something waterproof across northern Scotland. Some outbreaks of rain and a murky, grey start. The south-east winds will kick in and increasing amounts of sunshine will come in the afternoon. Across Scotland and Northern Ireland are the sunshine might be hazy but it will warm up at around 24 degrees on the coast. A small chance of a heavy shower or thunderstorm in Northern Ireland which could drift into Scotland during the evening but after a cloudy start for some in western parts of England and Wales, blue skies foremost and temperatures in the mid and high 20s, close potentially to 30 degrees.

Until she had the surgery she had lived in a completely silent world. Welcome to BBC London News with me - Riz Lateef. Boris johnson looked to reassure Londoners today that the Tunisia killings had not increased the chance of an attack in the capital. More than 600 officers have been involved in what is the largest counter-terrorism operation since the 7/7 bombings a decade ago. Here, high-profile events in the capital have been reviewing security, as our home affairs correspondent, Nick Beake, reports. The crowd surged in for the start of Wimbledon. He world of sunshine and shore breeze, but also security. There is no suggestion that the turnaround is a target but big London event had been looking at a security again. At the City Hall, the mayor said there was no evidence that the attacks had made London less safe. I think everyone was shocked by what happened in Tunisia and our thoughts are with the victims and their families. There is no read across that we know of, that the police or security services had been able to tell me about, between Tunisia and London today, in the sense that the risk remains where it was. At Trafalgar Square everything was routine. Children were on their school chips and tutors were taking photographs. The killings in five flag cannot raise the threat level in London or the rest of the UK. It has remained unchanged since last August when was raised in response to the emergence of Islamic State in Syria. The threat level remains to be outside terrorist attack at some point is likely. What was the feeling at Wimbledon today? I am a little concerned but we have to get on with our lives like we orderly would do. I am not concerned. I am confident that everyone is doing what they need to do to make the tournament secure. Everyone is thinking about what is going on at to this places these days, so that is a real concern. You have to get on with it. The point of terrorism is to make people live in fear. But this terrorism expert told us widely attacked in Tunisia will be of particular concern to the authorities here. You do have a tendency to be concerned about copycats. When there has been a high-risk incident in one place there was another attack emulating it quite soon afterwards. There is that sort of concern. Broadly the threat picture remains the same level that it was prior to the attacks in Tunisia or France or create over the weekend. Hundreds of counterterrorism officers are now engaged in the biggest operation since 7-7. They are investigating the murder of many British citizens who were enjoying their holidays. In the capital, the message remains to be alert and prepared but do not be scared. And coming up later: Reflecting on the 7/7 bombings as the tenth anniversary approaches. ~ I will be live in Tavistock Square will be will be talking to some of those involved in the aftermath of the attacks and discussing the lessons that have been like one last -- lessons that have been learnt a decade on. A schoolboy from Essex in hospital in Belgium following a serious coach crash yesterday is now out of intensive care. Pupils from Brentwood School were on a trip when their bus crashed - killing the driver. Alex Bushill reports. The kisses and cuddles at the school gate this morning had a particular resonance for a school reeling at events across the Channel, with two of their pupils hospitalised. You’re sick to the stomach. You just think about those poor parents. Who is going to get that call? It is just terrible, really, really terrible. Yesterday morning, when we heard this news, we were in pieces. They were all on a coach trip today. Really? Both of mine. Yeah. So, you know, life has to carry on. You can’t put them in a box. But it is your worst nightmare, isn’t it? It was Sunday morning that the school bus crashed, it is thought, into this pillar. On-board were 3411-13 year olds. They were on the road to Middelkerke, near Ostend, travelling through Belgium to Cologne on a languages trip. The driver was killed. His assistant was seriously injured, as was one of the pupils who are still in hospital with a fractured skull. Another boy is being treated for a laceration to his leg. For the remaining children, they returned home late last night. Waiting for them, the school’s headmaster. The parents who were there to meet them were delighted, of course, that they were back on English soil and they are walking off the bus. There were tears from both parents and pupils as well. A real sense of relief by all the staff who were on board that they had got them back safely. He now has to make sure that the remaining two pupils in Belgium come home safely as well. That and ensure the last week of term goes on as best it can. In all, 14 coach trips involving 600-700 staff and pupils have left the school today. It shows you how the school remains undeterred by events in Belgium. A cyclist is in hospital after being hit by a lorry close to Blackfriars Bridge. The woman - believed to be in her 20s - was treated by paramedics on the street before being taken to hospital. Her injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. Police want to talk to an elderly woman about an assault. The woman is described as being in her 60s and was using a walking frame. She elbowed a woman in the stomach over a row to do with priority seating. The victim was taken to hospital with a suspected broken ribs. A major road in south London is still closed this evening, almost twelve hours after a water main burst. Some businesses were flooded and many homes were left without water. Alpa Patel has spent the day in Kennington and joins us now. Alpa. ~ Iam here I am here on Kennington Park Road and it has been a dramatic day. The water pipe that cracked behind me is still being worked on by work man. When a cracked it unleashed a river of water. It has been a dramatic day here and here is how it started for some people. Those who use Kennington Park Road had a rather hear it journeyed this morning. At one point, the water rose to have a meter. Business owners had to work quickly. This man had to stop his estate agent being flooded. I got a cold this morning to say the water was rising up. When I got here I could not park anywhere because the road was blocked. We kept mopping the water out of the office and we got away with itjust. These women have a basement apartment. He came home from work fearing the worst. I was walking back to the fact on the station and the whole street was like a river. It was running down and I was up to mY It was running down and I was up to my waist in water. Thankfully we got in and the water was just at our steps. It closed you think your flat was to being flooded? Ten minutes. This is the culprit, a burst water main. The result was many people without water or with low water pressure. It carries a lot of water and the carriageway has been damaged. There are other services running alongside our price that we need to assess safely before we can start to expose the pregnancy had badly damages. As the last of the flood water drains away, significant disruption remains. This all took place on one of the warmest days of the year. ~ I spoke to Thames water about half an hour ago I spoke to Thames water about half an hourago and an hour ago and they said they received 4000 calls of disruption water supplies, but most people now have drinking water. Some do not but thatis have drinking water. Some do not but that is a small minority. Kennington Park Road is still closed and that is causing some disruption. Cars are lining up trying to get around and there is still some disruption, but the majority of that is over. Thank you. Still to come before 7pm: The little girl who was born deaf but can now hear thanks to pioneering surgery by doctors in London. Injust over a week, Londoners will be marking the tenth anniversary of the 7/7 bombings killing 52 people. 13 were killed when a bus exploded in Tavistock Square and tonight their friends and relatives will join survivors and those who helped in the aftermath at an event, made all the more poignant by this weekend’s atrocity in Tunisia. Katharine Carpenter is in Tavistock Square. The guests have been arriving for the annual 7/7 lecture that is being held here. It is all the more poignant because of the ten years since 7/7 and coming so soon after the terrible events in Tunisia. It is being held here at the headquarters of the British Medical Association. It has a lot of resonance with what happened in Tavistock Square. Many doctors rush on this building as soon as they heard the explosion on a number 30 bus here in the square on that morning at 9:47am. One of those but was killed was Miriam Hyman. I’m glad to say that her sister is here with us now. How difficult is this anniversary for you with all the focus ten years on? I am not sure why there is this focus on the big numbers, on the round numbers. For our citizen anniversary the same as all the others. When you think about your sister now, is it any easier for you to be here in Tavistock Square? It used to be very difficult for me to come through here but now I am used to it and I come here on a regular basis. It is part of the work that we do in her memory. I have developed coping strategies for these difficult situations. Along with other relatives you are now supporting a campaign for a memorial in the gardens behind you? That is right. Currently there is a very small plaque on the railings, but because of where the explosion took place there is the opportunity to build a permanent memorial here and I think it is appropriate. The one in Hyde Park is exclusively for those that were killed, the one in Hyde Park is exclusively for those that were killed, this and the emergency services. Everyone who was involved. You mentioned the survivors and one of those who survived is Martine Wright. She lost both legs in the blast on a tube at Aldgate, but has since competed in the Paralympic Games. Here she tells the story of the day that changed her life. ~ I woke Iwoke up morning. I was rushing around like I always did. I then started to run up an escalator, as I always do, and I saw the tube pulling in. I remember thinking, what a result. Reading the paper again, thinking, what a result. Reading the paperagain, I paper again, I thought this was going to be an amazing event, the Paralympic games, and I need to get tickets. Now I think it is part of mY tickets. Now I think it is part of my fate in life, maybe I was supposed to be there. I don’t remember a noise. supposed to be there. I don’t remembera noise. I remembera supposed to be there. I don’t remember a noise. I remember a white light in front of my eyes and I remember looking round at this white light in front of my eyes and thinking, what the hell is going on? I remember looking and trying to ascertain why I could not move and I saw all this metal and then on top of the metal is an image that will always stay with me. That morning I put on new white trainers and I could see on top of the metal, which was probably about six feet high and buckled into my legs, a white trainer, my own white trainer, and it was covered with blood. I saw it coming towards me and as they got closer and closer I saw piercing blue eyes and long blonde hair and she came through the door and I remember the first thing I said to her was, remember the first thing I said to herwas, help. Itold remember the first thing I said to her was, help. I told that my name was Martine Wright and I have stirred to tell my mum and dad that I was all right. -- and I have heard to tell my mum and dad. This was the off-duty policewoman who risk her life to come through and help. She disappeared for a while and then she came back with the belt. She said put that around your left leg. That is the last memory that I have on the tube at the next thing I remember was waking up ten days later after being in a coma. I think when you go through something to rheumatic and one day you are someone at the next day you’re someone else -- something dramatic, you lose your direction and you believe you cannot achieve your dreams and what you thought you were going to do for the rest of your life is done. I think that sitting volleyball gave me a dream again and a whole newjourney to go on. I have always thought, and still think every single day, that I was lucky and I was saved they are the emergency services and I have a fantastic support network and I am lucky to be here. Her extraordinary story they are. Supporting survivors like Martine Wright and the others who died was that massive task. The minister who was in charge is giving the lecture tonight and is here with us now. 7/7 affected you very personally, didn’t it? How are you feeling ten years on? As if the events of 7/7 were yesterday. All around the Square tonight and at the lecture you will find people exchanging their stories and memories as if they were yesterday. Obviously everyone was changed by this, not least the devastation for the 52 families who lost somebody that they loved but also the hundreds of people whose lives were changed for ever. There are lessons obviously to be learnt and to be applied to the terrible situation now as those families in Tunisia who at the beginning of the long journeys that these families are marking ten years later. Thank you. It was not only the extraordinary resilience of Londoners that was Praise, it was also a time of soul-searching. Our transport correspondent, Tom Edwards, has been looking at the changes brought in since the bombings. The 7th ofjuly bombings change London, including how organisations deal with major incidents. Ijust came across the scene of complete mayhem and chaos with people milling around. Alex King was one of the first chip staff is on scene. He spent the morning helping the emergency services. He was one of the many transport services members of staff who were there that day. We got on with it because someone had to do it. They were very professional and very down. People do not want to leave any of the locations until everyone had been safely evacuated from the trains. During the bombings, the radiocommunication ‘s Underground were inadequates. Some emergency services WEIâE iI’I8dEqU8lES. SOITIE EITIEI’gEI’ICy SEI’ViCES WEIâE services were delayed getting onto the tracks and they didn’t know if the power had been turned off. Saw ambulances went to the wrong location. And going to get someone to come and help you... There is no more training. This is an exercise involving 250 emergency workers. It is designed to improve coordination between the different services. We have made a lot of progress with their radios and 7/7. One area that we worked very closely with transport for London Web was that connect programme. We connect your mini cake with firefighters Underground and overground, between stations, and within the tube stations themselves. You have to put a cordon around here so that no one can get electrocuted... To get services to incidents are now driven by the police, meaning they arrive at the same time and can advise of the powerless. Over here we have our main power control men -- control of where everything is controlled and this is where all the incidents are managed. We are alongside the British Transport Police. This is different from ten years ago? Ten years ago these control centres were for locations. This is London Underground control centre. Is a new command structure temerity emergency services and every location on the cheap network has a specific number. We have got very strong processes and dedicated resources to deal with it. We test and will our procedure fairly regularly. Desktop exercises and live events are tested. I think we are better prepared. There are concerns from the unions that job cuts could jeopardise the response. London Underground disputes that. But what happened on 7/7 means that planning for incidents are greater part of what organisations need to do. There will be commemoration events next week on the 7th ofjuly. There will be a minute’s silence as part of a service at St Paul’s Cathedral that will be observed across the capital. Many thanks. Can Andy Murray win Wimbledon again? We hope so, and so does his coach Amelie Mauresmo. When he appointed the former Wimbledon champion last year it raised the question of why there weren’t more female coaches at all levels of the game. Chris Slegg has been to a club in Hertfordshire that’s bucking the trend. A year after being appointed by Andy Murray, Amelie Mauresmo remains the only female coaching a leading men’s player. On the women’s tour, the top 20 players all have male coaches, although Venus and Serena Williams are coached by theirdad and mum. That disparity in elite tennis is also apparent at grassroots level. It is estimated that here in London just a third of coaches are female. But one club in Hertfordshire is doing its best to change that. Fantastic, good job. At Leverstock Tennis Club in Hemel Hempstead six young women have recently qualified and between them coach players of all ages. I need about five of you... We have got a scheme here where we train the tennis leaders first of all. From there they take their level one and level two coaching course and the first couple were girls. The younger girls just took to them and want to follow that route. Our ratio is a bit different to other clubs, so we do have six young female coaches. It hasjust been the natural thing to do a team-leading course. That is what we all started off doing. A lot of female coaches still face prejudice for different things, so unfortunately I still think there is a long way to go. But I think it is great to see there has been some progress made so far. The LTA are keen for other teams to follow their lead. They are one of many clubs of decided they need to approach women and girls in a slightly different fashion, so when the children come in when they are very little they are attached to a mentor. The girls need to feel loved and encouraged to be part of group, which works amazingly well. I think with Amelie Mauresmo being Andy Murray’s coach and julie Murray, they have inspired a lot of women and young girls to play tennis. The female coaches of this tennis club are inspiring others as well. In a moment, we’ll be back at Wimbledon for the weather. After this remarkable story of four-year-old Leia. She was born completely deaf and her parents thought she’d never hear a word that they spoke. But after a revolutionary procedure carried out by doctors in London, she was finally able to hear them sing Happy Birthday to her. Marc Ashdown has the story. Her fourth birthday, but the first time that Leia has heard the song sung. She was born profoundly deaf with no auditory nerves, but thanks to pioneering implant surgery she is hearing properly for the first time. She had lived in a silent world and at the switch on there wasn’t a great deal of reaction that we could see as parents. We didn’t see any registration of sound. On the tube on the way home the door is made a noise as she turned her head and looks. We thought it was a fluke, but at the next station she did it again and again and all the way on the journey home. It has been a long journey. Most deaf children have a cop killer implant that repays the hearing nerves, but with no nerves to fix surgeons had to operate on Leia’s brain. She was very young when we were told that the implant would not be possible, only nine months old. We wondered whether we should put her through it that young. As it is so rare, the doctors do not know how successful it will be. We advise the families that the children will hear it sounds around them and we are optimistic that they may develop some understanding of speech sounds. Our ultimate name at the beginning was to make her more sound aware. It could stop her standing in front of a car on the road. We know that she hears music and TV, which were both denied to her before she had the surgery. Every day brings more sounds and the new breakthrough for this young girl. Lovely start to the week and to Wimbledon - which is where we can join Wendy Hurrell. ~ I think it has been a perfect start to the week. The weather has been spectacular today and almost perfect. There has been sunshine and temperatures in the mid-20s. It might be a bit too hot as you go through the next couple of days, but let us look at the graphics for this evening. It will be lovely with clear skies and a little cloud. It will be like winds overnight. It will not feel too muggy out there, although we will have a warm night. Temperatures will read 11-12 Celsius and London will reach 15-16 Celsius. That is a change, because some of the nights in this month had been quite chilly. Tomorrow we can start the day on a beautiful note. There will be some sunshine for Tuesday morning and a little bit of cloud and then the temperatures are going to climb. Tomorrow temperatures will get quite fierce at 30-31 Celsius in London in the afternoon with high UV and high pollen levels. Temperatures will peak into the evening. If you are joining the queue at Wimbledon it will be warm from the outset and ended temperatures will pick up in the sunshine. You will need to protect yourself from that. On Wednesday it will be very sunny and that will come with some very warm weather. Temperatures will peak at 33-36 degrees. Towards the end of the week it will be fresher and there may be some thundery showers. Thanks very much.

Several rows of sun loungers away. just stood there with this huge gun. In Tunisia today, the Home Secretary Theresa May paid her respects, urging nations with shared values to unite against Islamist extremism. We are very clear that the terrorists will not win.

And it’s day one of Wimbledon 2015, as thousands arrive to see some of the sport’s biggest names in action. On BBC London: Extra officers on duty after the killings in Tunisia, the Met’s largest counter-terrorism operation since 7/7. And the changes to how the capital deals with the aftermath of an attack. Good evening. Three days after the shootings in Tunisia which left 38 people dead, most of them Britons, the authorities have arrested several people suspected of helping the gunman. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, travelled to Tunisia to pay her respects today, as David Cameron warned that Britain faced a long haul in the battle to defeat Islamist extremism, which he called ""the struggle of our generation"". Let’s join our correspondent Orla Guerin in Sousse tonight. As the Home Secretary visited this beach resort, some families back in Britain were still waiting for their loved ones to be officially listed among the dead. There are holiday- makers among the dead. There are holiday-makers here who among the dead. There are holiday- makers here who continue to complain of a lack of information from tour operators and the Government. The authorities here have promised to provide protection at tourist sites. They know that unity’s international image is another has Ao of the attack. -- Tunisia’s image. Extraordinary footage of the attack as it took place. Confusion and horror at what is unfolding. Hotel staff and tourists following the killer, Seifeddine Rezgui. And amid the chaos, a warning from the employee bravely filming. He moves towards the bar area. employee bravely filming. He moves towards the bararea. In towards the bar area. In the background, the killer, his machine-gun clearly visible. He follows the gunman to the beach. As the gunman was on the loose, Angela Evans, from King’s Lynn, was lying on the beach with her neighbour. Now back home, she relived her ordeal. There was this man there, in black. just stood there with this huge gun. Moving ramble the people, shooting. -- moving ramble all the people. just killing, murdering them. We both sat at the same time, play dead. We felt, just fell to the ground, faces in the sand. He was coming nearer and nearer. Then his feet were at the side of me. You don’t move them. -- then, because you are next. Ijust prayed to God. Into the sand, I felt part of the gun. The sand skittered up. I could feel that he moved. And the shooting started again. I still played dead, untill started again. I still played dead, until I heard the noise move. The gun was getting a little bit further. We knew, if we were going to stay alive,, we had to move. We could not see him and the noise was towards the hotel. And here is how the killing spree was brought to an end. With gunfire in the side street. This was the firefight in which Seifeddine Rezgui was killed, but not before he massacred many innocent, they make is in the worst terrorist attack on Britain’s since the London bombings. At the beach today, more heavy weapons, but this time for protection. The Home Secretary stood shoulder to shoulder with her Tunisian counterpart, and with ministers from France and Germany. Theresa May laid flowers in honour of the dead, a sombre moment undera under a blistering sun. Nations brought together by bloodshed. The Home Secretary is now here at the scene where so many Britons lost their lives, where so many holiday- makers were gunned their lives, where so many holiday-makers were gunned down. It was about this time three days ago when the attacker was on the loose. The key question for the Government in the UK and the authorities here - can something be done to prevent another attack like this in the future? Then, beneath a banner saying ""we are Sousse was quick, the ministers promised a united front against extremism, and Theresa May voiced their outrage felt by many in Britain. What happened here last Friday was a despicable act of cruelty. How could a place of such beauty, of relaxation and happiness, be turned to such a scene of brutality and destruction? She promised help for the wounded, and this RAF transport plane which flew in from Brize Norton earlier, has now left Tunisia. It’s bringing four of the injured back home, to a Britain scarred anew by hatred and fanaticism. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Sousse. Families and friends of many of the Britons who died are still waiting for identities to be officially confirmed. Downing Street said 18 people had been identified so far. The British authorities have been asking the Tunisians to speed up the identification process. At least 30 of the 38 who were killed are believed to be British citizens. Among them were Sue Davey and her partner Scott Chalkley, and earlier today, Sue’s son Conor spoke to our correspondent Sian Lloyd. I want as many people to know my mum as possible. I know she’d hate that! I’m trying my best to try and let people know that we’ve lost a very special, special person to us. Conor Fulford fought to find out what had happened to his mother, Sue Davey. The A3-year-old had chosen Tunisia to have a relaxing holiday with her partner, Scott Chalkley. My memory is of my mum grinning from side to side and she’s looking at me on the camera, saying, ""We’re going to Tunisia next week, can’t wait"". But two days into their holiday, the couple were among those murdered as they sunbathed on the beach. Conor was working in America when he saw TV reports on the news, and began desperately searching for answers before flying home to the Midlands. Ringing the Foreign Office - nothing. Ringing around. I mean, it’sjust awful. I never knew where Mum was. So with that, I thought, ""I’m going to try and do it myself"". So I got on Twitter, Facebook. Hundreds of Tunisian people were messaging me saying, ""Don’t worry, I’ll look at hospitals for you and your family"". Do you feel let down by the authorities? The only word that springs to mind that’s been ringing around this house since I got back here was ""abandoned"". Sue’s family are critical of what they describe as a lack of communication from the Foreign Office. They also believe that too much attention is being focused on the gunman. Isis, again, are getting headlines. Isis this, Isis that. I mean, they’re claiming they were behind the attack. The real people that are living in this country and the real people that have unfortunately passed away seem to get bypassed. Family members are flying to Tunisia in the morning to speak to the local authorities. Their priority is to bring the mother of three and grandmother of two back home. Sian Lloyd, BBC News. In Tunisia, more people have come forward with vivid accounts of what happened when the gunman opened fire on the beach at Sousse and came face to face with some people who managed to escape with their lives. Inem Ammouma was working at the hotel reception when the attack happened, and she gave her eyewitness account to Fergal Keane. This is the face that looked into the eyes of murder and survived. This woman was working in her office near reception when violence erupted. TRANSLATION: Customers started running in all directions. They were screaming and crying, saying there was shooting at the beach. I heard shooting. I turned around on the gunman was next to me. He shot with his Kalashnikov and threw a grenade. I threw myself to the ground. Injured by grenade fragments, she got off. He had moved on. She went into a corridor, but ran into him again. He was moving backwards, checking if anybody was left, looking through open office doors. He pointed his gun at me as if to shoot me. Istarted begging him, please don’t, please don’t. As I said this, he put up his hand to say he was letting me go. When you faced him and begged for your life, what was going through your mind? All I could think of was how to escape. I was thinking of my daughters. Who would take care of them if I was killed? She believes the killers spared her because she spoke in Arabic. Her husband had received a panicked phone call from his wife as the drama began, and raced to the scene to try and rescue her. The gunman was shooting in the reception. I decided to jump over the wall and grabbed a baseball bat from my car. I was on the phone to my wife at this point, but the line went dead. I thought he had killed her. As he tried to enter the hotel and rescue his wife, he had a shocking encounter. As you were getting over the wall, you saw the killer. He stopped. He knew I was not armed. He stared at me, then he continued to walk on. I fell over the wall and injured my hand. Then I called my wife and she answered, and I went and found where she was. She was covered in blood. I knew that she was afraid of blood, but also that as long as she was breathing, there was hope. There to welcome their mother home from hospital, the couple’s three daughters. In this small room, a sense of gratitude was palpable. It is a new life. My wife is reborn, my family is reborn, as if we have become a new family. Thank God. But looming over this happy scene, there is much sadness for the dead, and worry for their country’s future. David Cameron announced what he called a ""full-spectrum response"" to the attack on British citizens, which he said was also an attack on British values and the British way of life. The Prime Minister said that so-called Islamic State posted an ""existential threat"" to the UK, calling for a united response with other nations which share the same values. Frank Gardner looks at the security challenges which lie ahead, both at home and overseas. It isa It is a year-to-date in so-called Islamic State declared itself a caliphate in the Middle East. It has bulldozed borders, blown up checkpoints and murdered thousands, yet over a thousand Britons are believed to have joined its ranks. Today in the Commons, David Cameron reacted to its latest atrocity by branding Islamic State an existential threat to the west. We must confront this evil with everything we have. We must be stronger at standing up for our values, and we must be more intolerant of intolerance, taking on anyone whose views condone the extremist narrative or create the conditions for it to flourish. And then, a minute’s silence for those killed in Tunisia. The Prime Minister than announced that there would be what he called a full spectrum response, but to what, exactly? The threat abroad has spread geographically. Islamic State now controls more territory than it did a yearago, now controls more territory than it did a year ago, including some in Libya. And this despite Western and Arab as strikes. In places, these have stopped them. Elsewhere, IS has consolidated, and there is little appetite for Western armies to take on the jihadists. Western tourists in places like Tunisia will always be soft targets. Protecting them is the job of foreign governance. Britain’s Foreign Office can only offer advice. There is little British government can do in specific cases of drug to prevent attacks, which come out of the blue like the attack in Tunisia. Who would have known? The threat at home is largely unseen. Through ports and airports, over300 is largely unseen. Through ports and airports, over 300 Britons have now returned from the war zone in Syria, and many new constant monitoring. Britain’s border controls are the most visible front line in the Government’s efforts to stop terrorists getting into this country. People of interest, especially those coming from Syria, are checked against a watch list, pulled aside by detectives and questioned. But there is another front line on the other side of this border am aware the Government is fighting an uphill struggle against terrorism. Islamic State has so far been largely winning the war on the internet, successfully spreading is violent message through social media. In Whitehall, there are two bills in the pipeline to tackle this. One is aimed at banning extremism, the other at accessing private communications. Meanwhile, the threat is changing. Plots are harder to detect right now because they have moved from being centralised plots organised by cells overseas into plots that are basically carried out by lone wolves who are recruited in isolation. This year, MI5, the Security service, has helped stop at least four plots. But the national threat level is currently out severe, meaning an attack is thought highly likely, and there is little chance of that threat subsiding soon. Frank Gardner, BBC News. Our deputy political editorjames Landale is in Downing Street. This full-spectrum response phrase, what do we make of it? At the moment that building and the Foreign Office in front of me are still focused on the situation on the ground. The Prime Minister spoke to President Obama this evening and they discussed how they can strengthen security inside Tunisia, but mines are beginning to turn to the longer term policy response. The Prime Minister’s phrase full-spectrum essentially means carrying on what he is already doing, fighting IS in Iraq, but also doing something more specifically. The Prime Minister wants to specifically. The Prime Minister wa nts to tackle wants to tackle what he calls the ideology behind IS, notjust tackling groups in the country that might support the violence but those who support the rationale behind it. We asked some way off seeing the detail of that. Thank you. The sense of crisis surrounding Greece and its place in the Eurozone has deepened today following the breakdown of talks at the weekend. Some European leaders have accused the Greek government of betrayal and urged Greeks to vote Yes in the coming referendum on the terms of a bailout. They warned that the alternative was Greece leaving the euro and the EU. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, said tonight that he would not respond to blackmail and threats. Live to Athens and our Europe editor, Katya Adler. Tonight it feels like both sides in this crisis, Greece and its creditors, are peaking over the precipice and they don’t like what they see. We have heard from the Greek prime minister and creditors like Angela Merkel, who insist a deal can be found but neither side are softening their position. Meanwhile the Greek people can only worry, weight and demonstrate. Greeks are often associated with passion and emotion, and feelings are running high on the streets here now. With Greece perilously close to falling into an economic abyss, utterly isolated in the eurozone. I expect a better future for my children because I don’t want them to be slaves in their own country. These are pro-government demonstrators warming up tonight ahead of Sunday’s referendum. Not officially, but viewed here by most as a vote to stay in or leave the eurozone, whatever the price. The price of the last five years’ international bailout has been incredibly high. In monetary terms for the creditors and for Greece in every way imaginable - political, social and economic. Both sides now are extremely bitter. This almost feels like the culmination of an abusive relationship. Athens is now an anxious city, insecure and alive with rumours. These pensioners heard that banks closed across Greece would open especially for them. They don’t have cash cards, they say they don’t know how to use them, but they wanted the 60 euros of their savings Greeks are now allowed to withdraw daily in their cash-strapped country. Waiting in the midday sun was too much for some, but these are desperate times. TRANSLATION: These 60 euros are pointless, you cannot buy anything with them. The austerity measures here are imposed by the haves, the European Union. As a pensioner, Iam a have not. How can I live with what our creditors have imposed? Tonight the Greek prime minister came on television to answer burning questions, importantly whether his decision to hold a referendum on imposed austerity was potentially slamming the door on Greece’s future in Europe. I guarantee that our target, our wish and objective is for the referendum to be the continuation of the negotiations and our government should then have more powerful weapons on the table. But political opponents say his government has never been serious about doing a deal. You have to remember that all these people are totally ideological against the free market and capitalism. They believe they want to have a social society so in their mind maybe what they are doing is for the interests of the people. In the real world it is a disaster. With events here and in Brussels changing so fast, Greeks anxiously follow every piece of news, knowing what happens to Greece now will affect the lives of everyone here, young and old. On the eve of the bailout deadline in Greece, share prices have fallen sharply, both in Europe and around the world. Greece is due to make its latest repayment to the International Monetary Fund by tomorrow night, but there’s little expectation that it will avoid defaulting on its debts. Our economics editor Robert Peston looks at the impact of the uncertainty on Greece and the rest of the eurozone. With Greek banks closed and the country teetering on the brink of another recession, Greece is moving closer and closer to abandoning the euro, which would have damaging ramifications for other eurozone countries and members of the European Union, as the continent’s most powerful politician admitted. TRANSLATION: Of course, the outcome of the referendum does have something to do with the question of the future of the euro. On the other hand, I know, or I guess, that the Greek people would like to form an opinion for themselves. The most immediate contagion from Greece was to European stock markets, with shares falling sharply from Frankfurt to Paris to Madrid. And with investors worried that Greece won’t be the last Eurozone state to face monetary disaster, investors demanded that governments of weaker economies - Spain, Portugal, Italy - should pay more to borrow. Now, you might think we’d already had our fill of dramatic moments in this Greek tragedy, but there’s plenty more to come. Tomorrow, Greece’s current bailout from the eurozone and International Monetary Fund will expire, leaving the Greek government short of credit. On the same day, Greece will fail to make a 1.5 billion euro payment to the International Monetary Fund, therefore achieving the dubious honour of becoming the first rich country in history to let the IMF down in this way. Then on Sunday night, we should get the results of the Greek referendum on whether to accept the controversial terms of a new Eurozone bailout. And remember, those terms have been roundly rejected by Greece’s government. So, if the Greek people go against the will of their own ministers, a new bailout may yet be in prospect and banks, thank goodness, would reopen on Monday. But if not, we could see a serious escalation of this financial and economic crisis. Here is a draft of the wordy ballot paper for the Greek poll. On paper, it’s about the terms of a Greek rescue, but the EU’s president, jean-Claude juncker, today said that in practice, it’s about whether Greeks want to stay in the euro and Europe. TRANSLATION: You should not commit suicide because you’re afraid of death. You should say yes, whatever the question is. As for Britain, we may have stayed out of the euro, but we’d be foolish to gloat from the sidelines. It’s one of the biggest external economic risks to the British economy and the situation today shows that these risks remain. I don’t think anyone should underestimate the impact a Greek exit from the euro would have on the European economy and the knock-on effects on us. So, if Greece is careering towards the euro door marked exit, even though such a door was never supposed to exist, that is bad news for all of us, because it could shatter confidence that our biggest export market, the euro area, will get back to proper health any time soon. Robert Peston, BBC News. Lord janner, the former Labour MP, will now be charged in connection with child abuse allegations following a review of the case. The Director of Public Prosecutions has agreed to reverse her earlier decision not to press charges. Alison Saunders had originally said that it was not in the public interest to charge Lord janner because he had severe dementia. Lord janner, who is 86, is alleged to have sexually assaulted nine children over three decades but his family has always said he is ‘entirely innocent’, as Clive Coleman explains. Lord Greville janner, for decades a prominent MP and Labour peer. In April, it was decided he would not face criminal proceedings on 22 allegations of historical sexual abuse against nine children because his dementia meant he was unfit to take part in a trial. His alleged victims were furious. Alison Saunders has become the first Director of Public Prosecutions to have a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned. Does she have any regrets? I took that decision very carefully at the time, the victims’ right to review process has been undertaken, it decided it was wrong, we should prosecute, and I have endorsed and accepted that decision. So, you accept that the decision was wrong? I have to put it to you that people will say, are you going to resign? It was a very finely balanced decision, and my concern was not just about making sure we had the evidence, which we did, but making sure we also took into account what the claimants wanted. A judge will now decide if Greville janner, who has always denied any wrongdoing, is fit to stand trial. If he isn’t, he will face what is known as a trial of the facts. There will be no finding of guilt, no conviction and no penalty. Ajury will decide only if he carried out the physical acts of abuse. Despite that, the alleged victims are pleased. Paul Miller is not one of the nine in the current case, but says he was abused by Greville janner. I think the point is for the victims to get their day in court, to put it across and to hear him face justice. After a very public episode of legal will-he-or-won’t-he played out at the highest level of the Crown Prosecution Service, criminal proceedings against Lord Greville janner will begin here finally on 7th august. The 2015 Wimbledon tennis championships have opened with straight-set victories for the defending men’s champion, Novak Djokovic, and for the number one women’s seed, Serena Williams. Spectators had a home victory to cheer as well. Here’s Andy Swiss with his round-up of the first day of action. Today’s Wimbledon forecast, sunshine and swarms of spectators. When it comes to queueing, no one does it better, and thousands played the waiting game. But finally came the grand entrance. Men’s champion Novak Djokovic up against Philipp Kohlschreiber...and, it seemed, the local wildlife in the form of a rather peckish bird. Kohlschreiber also ruffled a few feathers but not quite enough. Djokovic safely through in straight sets. It was a similar story for the women’s top seed. Serena Williams did have the odd uncomfortable moment but she was far too strong for Margarita Gasparyan. With power like this, she will take some stopping. Day one has brought glorious weather for players and fans, but would it bring any British success? With Andy Murray not starting until tomorrow, it was up to others to rise to the challenge. And so to the day’s unlikely hero in the form of a 21-year-old from Stockport. Liam Broady is ranked just 182nd in the world but he recovered from two sets down to beat Marinko Matosevic. Cue the chest-thumping. Yes, it’s only the first round, but for one day at least, the home fans have a new favourite. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One, it’s time for the news where you are. Good evening. I’m Riz Lateef. The Mayor’s reassured Londoners that the killings in Tunisia haven’t increased the chance of an attack in the capital. Officers have been involved in what is the largest counter-terrorism operation since the London bombings. Tonight, 7/7 was remembered with a memorial lecture attended by families and survivors.

He’s the world’s most expensive living artist. The most controversial. Seductive, childlike and downright odd. Imagine reflects on what lies beneath the shiny surfaces. Greece confirms it will not meet a crucial debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund by tonight’s deadline, and so moves closer to leaving the Euro. Most Greek banks remain closed, with increasing fears the country’s financial institutions will run out of money. We’ll have the very latest from Athens. Also this lunchtime: The RAF flies four British tourists injured in the Tunisia attack back to the UK - as the official death toll of Britons climbs to 21. The Government gives schools advice on how to spot pupils being groomed by extremists. Phew, what a scorcher. Brace yourself, a heatwave’s on the way. And Andy Murray prepares to regain his crown - we’ll have all the latest on day two from Wimbledon. This afternoon on BBC London: A schoolgirl describes the terrifying moment her coach overturned on a school trip in Belgium. And no rain or snow - but now the heat is being blamed for disrupting train services from Paddington. Good afternoon and welcome to the BBC News at One. Greece’s finance minister has confirmed the government will not make an important debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund of 1.6 billion Euros by tonight’s deadline. Non payment would take the country one step closer to being forced out of the European Single Currency, and be the first time a developed economy has defaulted on an IMF loan. A 120 billion Euro bailout package agreed with other Eurozone countries in 2011, could also expire tonight. Our Business Correspondentjoe Lynam reports now from Athens. Now developed European company has ever missed a payment to the IMF. Greece is marching towards that dubious honour. It almost certainly won’t find the 1.6 billion euros by 11pm tonight. Ordinarily Greeks who cannot withdraw any more than 60 euros per day things leak. TRANSLATION: I have reached the age of 50 and now they are telling me to live on 60 euros a day. There are four people in my family, that is 15 euros each. I have worked since I was 18 and now I don’t know if I will survive or if I will ever have dreams. Those who have signed our downfall, because of them the Prime Minister cannot figure things out, let’s say no to these gangsters, let us die with dignity, no more, enough is enough. Greek by Mr Alexis Tsipras had urged his country to vote no in a TV interview last night and that was the sentiment voiced by tens of thousands in front of the Greek parliament last night. The word they used most was the Greek word for no. No to austerity, more debt and in the referendum. Whilst I yes vote will keep Greece in the Euro for now, even if it comes with continued austerity. The dividing lines have been drawn and the nation is split down the middle on its own future. All the while the Greek financial war becomes even more acute. If as expected Greece fails to make the 1.6 billion euros payment today it will be considered in arrears by the IMF which does not considered debtor countries to be in default. But Greece must also make a payment of three and a half billion euros to the European Central Bank in three weeks. The total debt mountain stands at 340 billion euros, roughly twice the size of its annual GDP. 60% of Greek debt is owned by the Eurozone, ultimately Eurozone taxpayers are liable for Greek debt so if there is not some kind of deal, if Greece does not get a programme with its creditors and end up crashing out of the Euro then Eurozone taxpayers will have to pay for Greek debts, essentially. That all seems a world away for ordinarily Greeks. Limited in what they can withdraw from their own bank accounts. For some it is all a nightmare from which they cannot seem to wake up any time soon. Our Europe Correspondent Chris Morris is in Brussels. The Greeks say they will not pay up to, what are the immediate consequences of that? It is embarrassing, notjust for Greece embarrassing, not just for Greece but embarrassing, notjust for Greece but the rest of the Eurozone because of their collective failure in preventing this happening. But such is the depth of this crisis that thoughts are already turning to other matters, I think a year ago the idea of Greece not paying back this money to the IMF would have beenjaw-dropping but this money to the IMF would have been jaw-dropping but already in the European Commission behind me focus is on something else, the fact that Greece ‘s current international bailout expires at midnight tonight. There has been movement over the last 21+ hours, john Claudejunker in a phone call with Alexis Tsipras last night urging him to accept the deal put together by the Greek creditors and ask for a yes vote in the referendum. In response the EU would help Greece out, extend its bailout and it dangled the character of talks on some kind of debt sustainability taking place later this year. That does not seem to have moved things so far, we understand so far Greece itself will produce new proposals in the next couple of hours but this has to be done and ratified in national parliaments before the end of the day. With me now is our Economics Editor Robert Peston. Is this the beginning of Greece actually leaving the Eurozone? If the process has started it really started earlier this week when the banks were shut and controls were put in place on withdrawals of cash and movements of cash outside the country. Because let’s be clear a fundamental rule of the Eurozone is that cash has to be able to move really so that was the big symbolic moment. This isjune waiting for Greece, being unable to pay the IMF, because there has never been developed, advanced a colony which has failed to meet its payments to the International Monetary Fund in this way. Itjoins a rogues gallery of the likes of Afghanistan, under the Taliban. Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe. Those are the sorts of countries who have defaulted before and Greece does not want to be in their company. So, where do we go from here? The honest answer is none of us really know. This is scary, and charted territory, we havejust heard from Chris Morris that maybe talks will become a bit more constructive again in finding a solution which keeps Greece in the Euro. Pending tangible signs of progress, you have to say there is still an enormously big risk of Greece tumbling out and that will not only be damaging for Greece, it will be damaging as the Chancellor of the Exchequer said yesterday for the wider Eurozone. And because we are so intimately connected to the euros in through trade it will be bad for us. -- to the Eurozone. You can get more on the Greek debt crisis on our website including information on what happens if Athens as expected fails to make that IMF repayment. That’s at bbc.co.uk/greece. In the last few minutes, it’s been confirmed that 21 Britons were killed in Friday’s attack in Tunisia, although that figure is expected to rise to 30. Four British tourists seriously hurt in the massacre have been flown back to the UK by the RAF. Downing Street says all injured British nationals would be returned within the next 21+ hours. Ben Brown is there for us now. All through the morning people have been coming to the beach near where the massacre began to lay flowers in memory of the dead. A total of 38 people killed, at least 30 of them we now know to have been British. Plans are being made, we are told to repatriate the bodies of the British deadin repatriate the bodies of the British dead in the coming days but already some of the wounded survivors of the attack have been treated in a variety of hospitals here in the city of Sousse and have been flown home by the RAF. Into the care of British military doctors, the four injured survivors were treated in flight as the RAF flew them back to the UK. Medics with long experience of looking after troops from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan now find themselves helping holiday- makers from a beach resort. One of the most seriously injured is now being treated in Birmingham. The patients and our critical care unit here, they have been assessed by a whole raft of specialty doctors and surgeons. To plan a programme of SUI’gâoIâ1S. To pl3Iâ1 S pI’ogI’3TT’ITT’Iâ of CAFE surgeons. To plan a programme of care which will be ongoing today. Slowly too nosy is being emptied of its two lists. Mostly it is local people now on the beaches. The gunmen kill 38 holiday-makers and it seems he was also trying to kill the country ‘s tourist industry. To nosy and police say they have arrested seven suspected associates of the Keller, including his roommate. But how was Seifeddine Rezgui, and electronic student, turned into a cold-blooded killer? The irony is thatjune zero -- Tunisia also sends more fighters to so-called Islamic State than any other country. Young men radicalised it seems online, in mosques and importantly in universities. TRANSLATION: We produced a report about this organisation detailing the exact number ofjude and to have travelled to Syria and how they travel there. We want the authorities, this group is very dangerous, the number of students travelling to Syria is so big we expected some kind of attack. The police say there are so many young radicals here that they are struggling to cope. TRANSLATION: We hear a lot of warnings every day, sometimes they are cracked and sometimes they are not, you cannot imagine the efforts we make every day to protect our country from terrorism. The Interior Ministry had promised to boot 1000 extra armed personnel onto the streets to protect tourists but today we could not find much evidence of that. Holiday- makers will need not find much evidence of that. Holiday-makers will need more than this if they are to return to the beaches any time soon. Infact this if they are to return to the beaches any time soon. In fact the government have announced a package of measures to help the just industry here, they are going to give emergency loans over the next couple of years to tide over old tales and other holiday businesses who will see tourist numbers plummet. A major exercise to test how British police and security services would respond to a Tunisian-style mass shooting, is being staged in London. Scotland Yard is stressing it was planned months ago, and is not a response to any new threat. Our Home Affairs Correspondent, Dominic Casciani has the story. Winded commuters leaving a London Underground station, bodies on the ground in the street, armed police on the hunt for the culprits. This simulation of marauding attackers in London is the largest counterterrorism exercise of its kind in the UK. Each exercise is designed to challenge plans, expose weaknesses, and learn lessons which could save lives. Today’s operation is codenamed Strong Tower. It involves all of London’s emergency agencies, 1000 police and Whitehall security chiefs. The scenario influenced by the attacks in Paris injanuary and the public influenced by the attacks in Paris in january and the public can see and hear some of what is going on all stop but only a small team in Scotland Yard know how the exercise will play out across the capital. We are doing this deliberately to test their decision-making, we are doing to test how the emergency services work together, both at the front line as first responders but as the scenario unfolds it is also cricket we test how other organisations and government departments can move together, mobilise and work together to respond to this type of awful incident. We hope it never happens but it is incredibly important we are as ready as we could possibly be chewed it possibly a car. The training is shared with others. In her visit to Tunisia yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May pledged to help the government rethink how it helps the public. Officers stressed there is no threat to the capital at present but they have a legal duty to prepare and most of their planning happens in secret. Today’s operation will last until Wednesday but it will not be the last one on the city ‘s streets. Guidance to help schools identify children at risk of being radicalised is being issued today. The Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, says the advice will help teachers spot pupils who may have come under the influence of extremists and are being ""groomed."" But the main teaching union has criticised the move. Our Assistant Political Editor Norman Smith is in Downing Street. The Prime Minister yesterday topped about a full spectrum approach to dealing with the threat posed by Islamic State. We are getting a sense of what he means by that? Yes, we are beginning to understand what he means when he talks about becoming intolerant of intolerance and taking on the extremist ideology which he believes fuels the terrorism we saw in Tunisia because today all schools in England, secondary schools, primary schools and nursery schools are being issued with guidance which is meant to train and equip teachers to spot pupils who might be in danger of becoming radicalised. How do they do that? It is suggested they will see pupils who are maybe saying things, looking at things on the Internet or associating with people or behavioural changes which might suggest they are in danger of becoming radicalised. They can then be cancelled or confronted about their views or in extreme circumstances referred to social services or the police. There will be a hotline for teachers and governors to ring, but it is a hugely contentious area, Nicky Morgan was asked how would you know if a child’s views were evidence of him or her becoming radicalised and see shejested, becoming critical of homosexuals might be an indicator. But many major religions are also very critical of homosexuality and it does not necessarily mean the people exposing those views are in danger of becoming terrorists. The changing -- teaching unions also unhappy that they might become the thought police of the classroom. In the view of Mr Cameron the ideology has to be countered and that means catchline meet extremists before the become extremists, even in the classroom. A suicide car bomber has targeted a Nato convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, leaving at least one Afghan civilian dead and seventeen wounded. The large blast hit a group of armoured vehicles travelling close to the US embassy and a busy shopping area. Nato said there were no casualties among its own forces. Syrian activists say that so-called Islamic State militants have beheaded two women for sorcery in Syria. They are the first beheadings by IS of women civilians in the country. It is reported the women were beheaded along with their husbands - all accused of witchcraft. IS has previously decapitated the bodies of Kurdish women fighters killed in battle. Our top story this lunchtime. Greece says it won’t make an important debt repayment to the IMF, taking the country one step closer to leaving the euro. And still to come: Hang on a second, why time will stand still at midnight tonight. Later on BBC London: Police and MI5 officers are carrying out the largest mock counter-terrorism operation to date. And meet the Gaelic football team from Southall who haven’t got an Irish link between them, but they’re going to Dublin to play. The senior police officer most likely to have taken the decision not to arrest the Labour peer Lord janner in 1991 for child abuse has strongly denied he was put under pressure to cover up the allegations. Tony Butler, the former Assistant Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police, said the law would not have allowed the police to take the then MP for Leicester West into custody. Here’s home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds. Greville janner went to a police station in 1991 to answer allegations that he had abused a boy in the ‘70s. But he was never arrested and a former officer who led the investigation back then now says that should have happened. The only decision that was taken out of our hands was the issue of arrest. I would have preferred to arrest him because I felt we had enough evidence, but the powers that be said that was not the case. He is an MP, we have to think of his character and reputation. So, who took that decision not to arrest Greville janner? Well, Tony Butler was the Assistant Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police at the time. It could have been me, but it was not a cover-up. I had not been leaned on not to arrest him and there was nothing from outside the force that influenced that decision. He struggles to remember the decision, but believes an arrest would not have beenjustified under law. There was no danger he felt of him fleeing or destroying evidence and it wouldn’t have improved the chances of prosecution. But because there were no charges then, 21+ years have passed, during which Lord janner has developed Alzheimer’s disease, making it almost impossible for a jury ever to possibly properly consider a case against him. Plans to close BBC Three as a broadcast channel and move it online have been approved by the BBC Trust. It said the move should be dependent on several conditions, including a commitment from BBC One and Two to broadcast more BBC Three programmes aimed at 16 to 31+-year-olds. David Sillito is here.

The former champion race horse Kauto Star has been put down after sustaining a fracture to the pelvis as the result of a fall. The legendary chaser was retired in 2012 after winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup twice and the King George VI Chase a record five times. Sports reporter Patrick Geary reports. Kauto Star by name and superstar by nature as he galloped along Cheltenham’s final straight in 2009, he was riding into racing history. The first racehorse to regain the prestigious gold cup having previously lost it. That is what marked him apart. We had athleticism and character. He had a great talent. The never giving up. He had a great heart. He wanted to win. He put in a massive effort at the end and did not want to be beaten. Great determination and the heart of a lion. The years, his biggest rival was the horse next door, Denman, who took the gold cup in 2008. They were jumpers, prizefighters, a showdown that resonated beyond the sport. As well as two gold cups, he won five King George VI chases. In 2012 he retired from racing and took up dancing, moving to the world of dressage. But it is the image of Kauto Star at full speed that will endure. The horse that would not give up. We all know what a leap year is, but did you know there’s also a leap second? Tonight, time will stand still for one second, just before midnight, to keep our clocks in line with the Earth’s rotation. It last happened in 2012 and caused temporary problems for some websites. Here’s Victoria Gill. Marking the inevitable passage of time. While the clock mechanism in this tower can shift slightly with the conditions, those that run computer systems are synchronised to atomic clocks. Gradually the rotation of the earth falls out of sync with the atomic timekeeping and the solution scientists have come up with, every so often add a leap second to the day. The last one in 2012 delayed one airline’s flights and crashed some high profile websites. Because it has to be added manually, there is concern again. A big earthquake, like those in the last ten years, changes the rotation of the Earth and we have not had one for three or four years and that is why this second is needed now. And atomic clock has a regular pace. Leap seconds for the fact that overall Earth time is slower than atomic time. Scientists continue to debate the issue of whether to keep adjusting the physical on clocks, reconciling the unpredictable planet with the pace of atomic clocks. Meanwhile, much could happen in the last 2nd ofjune. In a second, lightning can strike six times, an estimated 2.1+ million e-mails are sent and the humble bumblebee beats his wings 270 times. Leap seconds have only been used as an adjustment since 1972. This will be the 27th. Time has been under scrutiny since the development from the first clock technology that gave a measurement more reliable than the Earth itself. Whether you believe we stick to Astra model-- astronomical time, you have an extra second to think about it. Britain is heading for a heatwave, with temperatures forecast to top 30 degrees today and tomorrow. Hundreds are expected to head to the coast to enjoy the weather, but a health warning has been issued for vulnerable groups. The sick, the very young and the elderly are being told to stay out of the sun. Duncan Kennedy has more. In or out of the water, summer has arrived on Britain’s shores. This was Brighton beach where temperatures hit the mid-20s by mid-morning. Lovely! Beautiful! It is hot. Having a pipe. 30, is that too much? 1+0 is enough. At a stroke summer seems to have arrived. Temperatures are set to hit 30 degrees for the first time this year. Not everybody gets to enjoy all of this. Councils and social workers have been put on alert to watch for the elderly and very young, who can struggle with temperatures as high as this. Keep cooL temperatures as high as this. Keep cool, drink fluids, keep out of the direct sunshine in the heat of the day and also keep your home as cool as you are able, using curtains, keeping windows opened at night. There might be a breeze on the coast. Temperatures are so high in the Thames Valley trains are delayed because of track problems. Tomorrow it might get hotter. It is the jet stream with fast wins, moving around weather patterns. At the moment it is dipping far south, dragging up warm airfrom Spain and France. We are getting Spanish weather in the UK. It is turning into the hottest day in Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Knocking on july’s door, expect this wave of heat to cover pretty much all of us in the coming days. It is hotting up at Wimbledon. We will get up to 30 this afternoon and break through the barrier tomorrow. The heat is coming from Spain and France. Temperatures will probably peek through tomorrow afternoon in the south-east. The heat will be quite widespread. Today we have seen strong, june sunshine. Pollen levels are very high across large parts of the UK. Scotland seeing sunshine. Hot also in northern England. Northern Ireland, across most of England and Wales, the late 20s. In London, up to 31 degrees. Through the evening, there is a chance of a thunderstorm in the north and the west, but most will be fine and dry. Hot and humid air coming from the continent. By dawn, some places will still be hovering around 20 degrees, which is unusual in the United Kingdom. A warm and humid start and humidity could spark early thunderstorms. They will drift their way northwards. If you miss them, and many places will, there might be cloud in the sky. We will see temperatures again up to 27 degrees ",,

It goes over £1 billion to pay back the country ‘s chief negotiator says Greece wants to stay in the EU. We are not trying to damage the Eurozone, we are trying to find a solution for Greece to preserve the Eurozone.

And the taxi driver rapist, john Worboys. The Met is told it must pay compensation to two victims. round in soaring temperatures. Good evening and welcome to the BBC News at Six. There are just five hours to go before the deadline expires for Greece to pay back a £1.1 billion loan to the International Monetary Fund. If, as expected, it misses that deadline, it will become the first developed country in history to fail to give the fund its money back - and it could be heading out of the Euro - with far reaching CONSEQUENCES BCFOSS EUI’OpE. Greece has submitted another last minute bailout proposal to European finance ministers to try to stop the country going bust- but the German chancellor has ruled out any new agreement before the Greek referendum on Sunday. Our Europe Editor Katya Adler is in Athens now. Quite a crowd behind you? Yes, talk about storm clouds gathering, there is a real sense of tension here in Athens this evening, all along throughout the negotiations with their international creditors the Greek government have shown they do not want to play by the rules. Hours before the current bailout deal expires it came up with this proposal, Eurozone finance ministers are on the fortnight now discussing it. This crowd says they want any deal to keep grease inside the Eurozone but for now future of Greece remains uncertain. Tucked away in a rundown corner of Athens is the jewel that is this market. People here shrug their shoulders at the rumours of a new potential deal between their country and its international creditors. They are far busier working out what they could or could not buy. Greece and its people are cash-strapped. The government has limited withdrawals to banks to 60 euros, about EAO a day. He is desperately trying to sell these cherries that he bought for 2 euros a kilo this morning and is now selling for1 euro 50. With cash so tied most of the customers see fruit as a luxury. Greece is peeking over the abyss, its current deal runs out tonight. It is edging ever closer to falling out of the Eurozone. But the country ‘s lead negotiator told me that behind the scenes last-minute talks were ongoing and going well in his opinion. Is the question do you think it is likely that yet again we will find a solution one minute before midnight then I think there is a good probability that will happen. Do you feel you are leading a revolution in European politics? I would not have said supporting the lowest of the law, the poorest of the poor was revolutionary. There was a time when that was part of the consensus, that the needs of the many are part of the solution, not part of the problem. This is a time of monumental importance, notjust for Greece and its people or even the whole Eurozone, but for the direction of Europe. It is as if you’re in Athens the powerful political forces in Europe are meeting and clashing, on the one hand you have the powers that be, traditional political parties, many Greeks would say any case the European institutions deciding from above what is best for the people below. Then you have new popular, populist movements who want to turn the status quo on its head. You see them in Spain, Italy and Greece. They say they are for people power. A stark choice between very different political styles. One that faces Greek voters if the referendum goes ahead as planned this Sunday. These women strongly disagree about the best way forward for the country. I believe the best way is through the current government because they are trying to give the power back to the people and those who have not. That is the best recipe for a better Greece and a better Europe. I disagree, I feel that we need to work closely with institutions and bring change from within. There is no future for Greece if we leave the Eurozone, if we leave the European family. This evening Athens is a whirlwind of rumours. The feeling on the street is that it is doubtful and new deal will be agreed tonight, that will become clear in a few hours, by which time the current bailout ends. The country enters the unknown. 22 British people have been positively identified as among the dead of Friday’s attack in Tunisia. It’s believed the final British death toll will reach 30. Relatives have now confirmed that Eileen Swannack, from Wiltshire, has died - and john Stollery, a social worker from Nottinghamshire. The Tunisian President has announced an investigation into security failures - as orla Guerin reports from Sousse. A reassuring presence by the shore today, but Tunisia’s president has admitted that the security services were caught off-guard by the massacre on the beach. A thousand armed officers will now be deployed along the coast. Police here and in Britain are investigating the gunman’s movements, there are unconfirmed reports he was trained at a camp in Libya. Several alleged accomplices have been arrested and these men are wanted in connection with the attack. On the left, a 2lI-year-old student. And 28-year-old the right. Whilst the killer was racing along this stretch of each trying to take as many lives as possible, other Tunisian’s were determined to save them. Local hotel staff came rushing and gathered up as many to list is as possible and got them out of the line of fire. The people swimming, I’d take them here on the boat. Hammond scooped terrified tourists into his boat. He rushed to help them even though the killer was in sight. When he went to the pool, it was maybe 30 person in the sea, me and my friend with the boat, we tried to save them. It was maybe... Three women and four men. English men. I saw him on the TV he is OK. This, this, one this. The two lists come that way. When the killer came to his street this man took cover, but not alone. Go inside, go inside. He shepherded about 32 lists into his shop, Reddan is among them. The people stay here, and here and here. One women as two little children. I said don’t talk. He kept them quiet and safe for an hour until the coast was clear. Those seriously injured in the attack have been flown home, carefully tended by the RAF. Survivors of a massacre in a country that was the success story of the Arab Spring. More holidaymakers who were caught up in the attack are now home. Our Special Correspondent Lucy Manning has been speaking to one family from Sheffield. We will never, ever forget that day, we will learn how to live with it, but it will always be in our memories. A two-week holiday in Tunisia turned to terror in just two days. All of a sudden Ijust hear Mrs, get off beach! That was it, and Ijust knew there was something. We ran for our lives, said to my dad they were shooting, they were shooting. All I was thinking was that I have got to protect my family, I have got to protect my family that is here. The family from Barnsley were staying on the beach close to the hotel which was attacked as the gunman ran down the beach they first hid in a beach hut and then fled to a shop where they cowered in a cupboard. We had to hide like this just to protect ourselves. My dad was over like that, my mother was at the side of me protecting and from there in the cupboard all you could hear was bang, bang and boom. Terrified, the most scariest time of my life. What were you thinking, what was going through your mind? All the time I was thinking I have fetched these on holiday and I feel responsible for it because I have fetched them on holiday. Work hard all year round and this is how we are being repaid. It is a horrendous feeling. Maxine is convinced that in all the mayhem there was more li’I8N ONE QUNNTBN. These shots coming from all over, we did not know which way they were coming from, I don’t care what they say, there were definitely more than one, I don’t care what they say. Why do you think there were more than one? No way all those shootings and all those bangs could have come from one gun. Bronwenjust a teenager but one with wise words after the frightening experience. I think they’re just try to make us live fear and be scared of all time, they want world domination. The British government will not let this happen because we will be strong and stick together. They want to live us in a nightmare but we will stay strong, we will be happy. The family have vowed to never go abroad again. A major exercise to test how British police and security services would respond to a Tunisian-style mass shooting, has been staged in London. Scotland Yard say the scenario was planned months ago, and is not a response to any new threat. It comes as the government gave more details of how it plans to tackle extremism - as our Political Editor Nick Robinson reports. GUNFIRE Do not adjust your set. This is a street in central London today, but it is not real. Planned many months ago it is an exercise designed to test how ready the emergency and other services are for an major terror attack. Of the sort last seen here a decade ago. If it ever gets to this stage, it is much too late which is why the government say they are notjust looking which is why the government say they are not just looking at security measures, they are also investigating how to make sure that people with extreme views were not become people who carry out violent acts. What are the risks of social media? Today teachers were asked by ministers to monitor the pupils for signs of extremism, just as they already look out for signs of child abuse. We are not asking them to be the police, we are asking them to raise with the headteacher or the head of Department, this person has said something which seems a bit unusual, do you think this is something we should report to the local authority or the police or the Department fridge? Are you saying thatif Department fridge? Are you saying that if teachers and others correct the behaviour of a seven or eight-year-old, we might stop is shooting on the streets of Britain? It is always possible. We might stop people travelling and putting themselves and others in danger. This government documents bells out the tell-tale signs. The teaching union says their members don’t have the skills and besides, it is not theirjob. Teachers now cannot be turned into spies in the classroom. What they have to do is afford opportunity for discussion and put the counter arguments where they need to, but not close down, not close down the space so that children don’t even come in and have those discussions. Run tomorrow and you will oblige and not just schools but prisons and hospitals, universities and colleges to prevent what is called extremist radicalisation taking place within their walls. At Britain’s largest mosque in south London there was a welcome, albeit a cautious one, for this new law. Anything we can do to hinder the forward movement of terrorism extremism is something we should look forward to. Everyone is entitled to a viewpoint, as long as they are not physically harming others with that viewpoint they are entitled to hold it. This is a chilling sight, even if what look like bodies are in fact perfectly healthy volunteers. Of course, one day, they might not be. Thousands of ferry and channel tunnel passengers have been stranded again because of another port strike in Calais. It’s the second time in a week French workers have walked-out. Migrants have been gathering along the length of the trafficjam on the French side, trying to board the stationary trucks bound for Britain. Our Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson is in Calais. What is the scene there at the moment? The tunnel has reopened and the lorries have been moving behind the albeit very slowly. After the chaotic scenes last week, police have been carrying out 100% checks on freight entering the tunnel, that has slowed things down as well. But even after protesters blocked the traffic earlier today, the really heavy police presence has meant that we have seen very few migrants along this notorious stretch of motorway. This at the end of a day which promised more chaos. The tracks that link Britain and France closed today to everyone, tourists, truck drivers, even migrants. This time the illegal occupiers of the Channel Tunnel were its employees, protesting the sale of the cross-channel ferry service, with the loss of hundreds ofjobs. TRANSLATION: I would say that our objectives would be to block the strategic points, but means it could be the tunnel, the highways, the harbour. Everything that could allow us to change things to put pressure on the government. The queue of vehicles making back into France created new chances for migrants to climb on board. This time, police were ready. Bridges security fences have helped separate the port from the camps around it. A similar corridor will be built here at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel. This was once a problem of logistics, of local tensions, was once a problem of logistics, of localtensions, economic local tensions, economic loss. Nowadays it is the tip of a political iceberg, a community in limbo as future hangs over every capital in Europe. -- whose future. Our top story this evening: Greece submits another bailout proposal, withjust hours to go before the deadline to to pay back a key loan. Later on BBC London: Wimbledon’s own Laura Robson plays her local tournament. We’re live at SW19 to see how she got on. And as temperatures continue to soar in the capital, we’ll have a full weather forecast. 15 years ago, the United Nations marked the new millennium with a series of pledges aimed at improving the lives of the world’s poorest people. The Millennium Development Goals were ambitious. Eight different targets covering a number ofareas, including reducing poverty and improving healthcare and education. This year marks the date for the goals to be met. Progress has been mixed, but Bangladesh is one country that’s made big gains. In the first of a series of reports on Millennium Goals this week, Mishal Husain is in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka. Britain’s overseas aid programme is one of those that has been influenced by the Millennium Goals and Bangladesh has been one of the recipients. The country is on track to meet some of the Millennium Goals. In one poll part, I have been seeing how the power of decision-making lies with a local people -- poor. In the middle of Dhaka’s richest district, a shanty town that has sprung up on the edge of a lake. It is home to nearly a quarter of a million people packed into these small alleys. Many came here in search of a better life, but it is a basic and poor existence. This is a tough place to live, but even five years ago conditions here were much worse. Aid money has been used to help the residents, and the striking thing here is how the local community has been organised and empowered to tell outsiders what kind of improvements they really need and how the money should be spent. Setting up this creche was one of those decisions. The women said they needed it so they could go out to work. The community leader showed me a project that she has overseen. These are the toilets you built? British aid helped to pay for these, and she says everyone has benefited. TRANSLATION: This place used to be a rubbish dump. Dogs and cats were living here. People used the place as a toilet. A lot of our children got ill because of that. We decided to build this toilet. These have made a big difference to our lives. It is a question of livelihood as well as life. The community leaders also help to identify those in need of loans, often used to start small businesses. This woman has been living here since she left her husband 11 years ago. TRANSLATION: He used to beat me up really badly but I tried hard to live with him. After my first child was born I thought, let’s try again for the ba by’s sa ke. He carried on beating me. He burned my skin with a cigarette and cut my finger off. He tried to gouge my eyes out. Finally I decided no more. With the help of a small loan she set up her shop. It has gone from strength to strength. TRANSLATION: The loan has changed my life. Before, I had very little. Now I have money I can pay for my rent and my daughter’s education. I can even wear nice clothes, and I have a mobile phone. The children who live here have benefited from the development of the slum, but Bangladesh still has tens of millions of people living below the poverty line. Transforming their life chances is an immense task. A brief look at some of the day’s other news stories. New figures show Britain’s economy grew more strongly than previously thought in the first three months of the year. Output increased by 0.4% betweenjanuary and March, compared with the previous estimate of 0.3%. Kauto Star, one of the most famous racehorses of recent times, has been put down after being injured in a fall. The 15-year-old was retired in 2012 after winning the King George VI Chase a record five times and the Cheltenham Gold Cup twice. Schools in England are to face tougher exam targets, and failure to meet them will mean a school is labelled as coasting. The Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, says schools will have to improve or leave local council control and become academies. By 2016, 85% of primary school pupils will have to reach a good standard in reading, writing and maths. In secondary schools, 60% of pupils will have to get five good GCSEs. Ministers say making schools into academies will improve standards, but as our Education Editor reports, that’s not always the case. On the east coast of England, Lowestoft will feel the impact of these plans. Too many schools have failed here. Too little has been expected of its children. What would you take to go on an island? What will make a difference for these five-year-olds? Their school is like many ministers want to target. Inspectors say it has to improve, and the new head teacher agrees. Children are way below national expectations in this school and many schools in this community, and there is no reason why they shouldn’t do as well as their peers in London or other areas of the UK that are doing well. This school is changing its tune, becoming an academy. Paid for by taxes but run independently. More schools, including some rated as good, could be forced to make the same change. What will make a difference for these children? The school is hiring lots of new teachers, not just from the UK, but from Australia and Canada. Parents are coming in to help repaint the buildings, and they are going to be running extra classes over the summer to help them catch up. Teachers’ unions say changing who runs a school is not a magic wand. just down the road this secondary school became Eastpoint Academy in 2011. That didn’t solve teaching or truancy problems. It was a failing school with four head teachers in just two years. Now it has turned a corner as part of a different chain of academy schools. Having an academy chain down the road, where we can get help and support for members of staff who are unsure about how to do something and seek advice from schools that are well-established, is really important. On the beach I found school leavers. David wants to be a welder but says he was let down by school. I was not taught for about a year and a half until I left that school. I was chucked into my GCSEs without knowing anything. I was lucky to scrape Ds. The real test of these plans will be in towns like this. Day two at Wimbledon, and the temperature is rising. It’s hit more than 30 degrees on Centre Court, where the British number one Andy Murray won his first match of the tournament. keeping your cool. Whether you were Andy Murray arriving for duty or the fans preparing for the scorching sunshine. Today’s biggest queues were for the water fountains. How hot is it? Sweltering. Relentless. It is like being a Friday on a hot rock. I am It is like being a Friday on a hot rock. Iam here rock. I am here on Centre Court. Lee has not started and already it is more than Ao degrees in the sunshine and getting hotter. The secret is not to hang around. Kvitova showed the way. Thrashing her opponent in just 30 minutes. Others took the tougher route. Heather Watson saving three match points on her way to the gutsiest of wins. Soon it was Murray’s moment. He has been inspired since his marriage in April. He even ties his wedding ring to his shoelaces. It seemed to be business as usual. He sees the first set and the initiative. His opponent came blazing back. That left him serving for the second set. When it mattered, Murray repeated his magic, taking a tie-break in some style. From there, it was largely one-way traffic. A straight sets win. His Wimbledon off to a solid start. We have also seen wins for Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Laura Robson lost in straight sets. Three Britain’s through to the next round. -- Britons. Temperatures will be even higher. It was 30 at Wimbledon. And in many parts of the UK. The hottestjune on record. It is all about where the heat is coming from. Spain and France, Ao Celsius outside of the sun. 35 around the London area. A sultry night to night. Perhaps a shower in western Scotland. Perhaps isolated showers to southern England. Most places will be dry. Some of us will have 20 to start the day tomorrow. Tough for sleeping. We have heat and humidity, but not the clear blue sky that places so today. The occasional storm going through western parts. In the heat, more of us flirting with 30 Celsius. It will be oppressive notjust on Centre Court. Late tomorrow, these thunderstorms, isolated, but they could be torrential. There could be disruption. Clearing on Thursday. A change. This weather front coming through with cooler and fresher air.

Specialist teams have also been scrambled. They have additional equipment to manage patients with gunshot wins and they receive additional training to help them identify sick people quickly and to treat them and to get them away from the scene to an emergency department. I asked the exercise director how realistic is this. It will look and fail to the officers the same as it would in a real-life situation. These officers and emergency service operators have âTT’IâI’gâIâ1Cy SâI’ViCâ opâI’3toI’S have I’1âVâI’ SEED emergency service operators have never seen something like this on the street of London. The emergency services will be dealing with were simulated attacks tomorrow as well. And Nick’s here now. A major operation, but, just to be clear, this has nothing to do with an increased threat level? The emergency services have a legal obligation to test how well prepared they are. The last big exercise was in on that occasion they simulated a chemical attack on a tube. This time it has been marauding gunmen. However, they have gone to efforts to say that this has been planned for the last six months and it is not in response to any particular threat to London or the threat in Tunisia. However, the style of attacks that we have seen today have been similar to those he has seen in other parts of the world and the security services are obviously concerned about that. What is significant is what the cameras did not capture today, because in other parts of the capital away from members of the public and our cameras were other simulated terrorist attacks. That is important because that simulates what is happened in Mumbai and Paris where there had been multiple locations and the emergency services have been very stretched. I asked her how realistic this would be. It is hard to say, but casualties were not taken to hospital today which is one aspect that was not until the authentic. It was a huge operation and it takes on added poignancy for many as they reach the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 attacks. We saw then had plans need to be made and they can be brought into action when we least expect it. It’s been the hottest day in the year so far in the capital and temperatures are due to rise tomorrow to a ten-year record high. Many Londoners have taken the opportunity to bask in the sunshine, but, for some, the weather has meant travel disruption and discomfort on the transport network. Alpa Pateljoins us from Regent’s Park. It has been a hot day today. Today at Regents Park in reached 28 Celsius. It is one of the hottest days of the year so far. People had been coming to with a calendar is how much they are enjoying hot weather. They can sign comes tomorrow when experts say temperatures could reach 35 Celsius. That would make it not only the hottest day of the year, but the hottest year in almost a decade. That could bring problems for people with health conditions and also for public transport. More on that in a moment, but firstly here is our correspondent with more about how people in London are coping with the hot conditions. It is not just Andy Murray who has been competing in blistering temperatures. The sack race at Charlton Manor Primary in Blackheath was tougher than ever. So how did these kids keep their cool? I put some suncream on. I have drunk a lot of water and I have also been sitting around in the shade. Wise advice that Londoners elsewhere did well to heed. Most welcomed the warmth. I’m enjoying the weather. It is far too cold and windy and wet and dismal normally, isn’t it? It is so nice to have a bit of sunshine, blue skies, and even though it is very warm, it is very pleasant, isn’t it? I think certainly the tube is always a bit of a nightmare. That is always the way. I think only on the newer lines does the air conditioning work properly. Getting around is a struggle. The heat is bad enough, but delayed trains add to the frustration which leads on to the burning question, ""Why can’t our railways cope?"" The reason for this is if you imagine a steel rail, it expands in the heat and it gets longer and longer and longer and the gaps between the rails get smaller and smaller and smaller until, when they get really hot, they disappear altogether and the rail is under compression. When that happens, we have to slow trains down on certain parts of the networkjust to keep things things safe. So expect delays today and tomorrow when temperatures could hit 35 degrees. That is lovely for some, but, with London’s pollution levels so high, it is potentially deadly for others. Vulnerable people - such as children, older people, and people with health conditions - may find their symptoms are aggravated further and things like asthma attacks can be triggered by exposure to this kind of pollution. You might also be wondering where all this is coming from. It is all to do with the jet stream - the fast winds high in the earth’s atmosphere that move around our weather patterns. At the moment the jet stream is dipping down really far south, dragging up warm air from Spain and France. We’re getting some Spanish weather right here the UK. Love it or loathe it, the heat looks set to continue. applied the sheet is affecting the trades. What is the latest on the disruption? As you heard in that report, a small number of great Western trains were disrupted. We’re talking about sex trains between Paddington -- disrupted. We’re talking about sex trains between Paddington -- about sex trains from Paddington. It off the 15,000 trades that ran today, only six of those were disrupted by the heat. You can thank us for tomorrow as temperatures rise and the track could heat up leading to speed restrictions that could cause to shops and the track could heat up leading to speed restrictions that could cause dish option at Paddington travellers had a miserable time. The Channel Tunnel was closed for three hours. This is unrelated to the heat and is all to do with striking ferry workers. The service is up and working but there are some delays. Back here at Regents Park, as you can see people are still enjoying the hot weather. The advice for tomorrow is to continue to enjoy the hot weather, but to drink lots of water and to stay out of direct sunlight, but to enjoy it nonetheless. Thanks very much. More London Underground workers have voted to strike in a row over the new all-night tube service. Members of the drivers’ union Aslef are planning to walk out for 24 hours over the 8th and 9th july. They’ll now be joined by members of the RMT and TSSA Unions. An anti-Semitic demonstration, due to take place in a predominantlyjewish part of North West London, has been moved to another location by police. Neo-Nazi protesters had originally planned to march through Golders Green this Saturday, the jewish Sabbath. The decision follows widespread local protest. The group already held a very small anti-Semitic march in Stamford Hill last month. A mother and her teenage daughter have been found dead at their home in Esher. The father’s body has been discovered in southern France. Surrey Police have told the BBC that he died after they did and they are not looking for anyone else. Tarah Welsh reports. They brought flowers to pay their respects, but what happened behind these gates was difficult for some to take in. 1lI-year-old Ava and her mother Lisa Anthony were found dead here yesterday morning. Those living in and around this gated community are clearly shocked by what has happened. Homes here are expensive and Esher is seen by some as a haven away from the city. A lot of commuters come out to Surrey for safety, so you can raise your family in a safe environment and this is absolute shocking to all of us. What are the sort of emotions felt by people who live locally? Truly disbelief. Disbelief that that could happen here. We feel it is a very safe and tight-knit community. It is truly shocking. The deaths are being linked to the discovery of a man’s body in the south of France. He is believed to be Ava’s father and Mrs Anthony’s husband. Surrey Police have told the BBC that he died after the mother and daughter. The police said the investigation is still in its early stages, but they want to reassure people that they do not believe the wider community is at threat. They are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths. The Met Police has lost its appeal against a court ruling which ordered it to pay compensation to two women who were sexually assaulted by London cabbie, john Worboys. The force was found to be liable for failures in their investigation into the rapist, as Katharine Carpenter reports. Over a six-year period, john Worboys would pick up women in his black cab late at night them, and sexually assault them. It is thought that he committed more than 100 rates. An inquiry found that he could have been stopped earlier if the Met had investigated properly and had listened to the victims who came forward. He dropped me at the police station unconscious and nobody had even bothered to take his details. I was quite upset. Ajudge ruled that that woman was one of two victims who were let down by the Met. She reported her assault in 2003. The second woman was attacked in july 2007 and also went to the police. john Worboys was finallyjailed for life in 2009. Four years later, the High Court ruled that failures in the Met investigation into two degrading treatment of the women under the degrading treatment of the women underthe Human under the Human Rights Act and the force was forced to pay compensation amounting to ilili,000. The Met did not agree with that ruling and they came to the Court of Appeal. The force always said that this was the point of principle and it didn’t want to detract from the bravery of the women. They also said it would not be about money because the women would keep the no matter what there was. I’m finding it that they had lost the challenge defended the right to have lodged an appeal and they said it was right that the interpretation of human rights law was tested. Coming up later in the programme: On the day Andy Murray reaches the second round of Wimbledon, we will be hearing from another player about her return from injury and when they will be here with the weather. -- Wendy. We heard earlier about the major mock counter-terrorism operation involving the police that is currently underway in London. Well, one officer who experienced first-hand what it’s like to deal with a real terror attack is PC Ashley Walker. Ahead of the tenth anniversary of the 7/7 bombings, he’s been telling us about that day when he was one of the first on board the exploded bus to rescue victims. This is his story, in his own words. We heard the news about King’s Cross and smoke coming out from the station. A few of us moved down towards Tavistock Square, redirecting traffic. I was about 100-150 metres behind a bus, a number 30, when it exploded. Initially Ijust heard a loud crash, like a thud hitting the floor. I was just shocked and I didn’t know where the noise came from. I looked straight ahead of me and I could see the roof of the bus in midair. Eventually I was looking at the bus, people hanging off where they had been blown off the bus. I think the realisation came to me knowing that this was a terrorism attack and then all the faces looking towards me to do something, but then I could see all the injured people still around and all the cries for help. That was when I made my way to the bus. I could see the devastation and the members of the public that hadn’t been fortunate enough to survive. Then you still had a lot of injured people who were trying to escape from the bus with blown-off limbs. On entering the bus, I could see a strange package on the bottom deck, so I informed a colleague that there was possibly a second explosive device on the bus and they were able to get everyone immediately away in case it blew up again. There were still two members of the public trapped on the top deck. One gentleman, I could see his head and face and there was just no way for me to physically pull him off the top deck. There was another gentleman in a pinstriped suit. I could see part of him and I could hear him, but there was no way of getting him out of the bus. I had to make the decision to leave him, potentially to die on a bus. We had the explosives unit come down and they conducted a controlled explosion on the actual device. when it was clear that it was safe to enter the bus, the fire brigade turned up and one of the gentleman was still alive on the top deck. The fire brigade cut him free. I still think about the other gentleman that we left on the bus. He was still groaning, he was alive. It goes through my mind every day, but I try to put it behind and think of something else. Being back at Tavistock, it brings back floods of memories. It is still raw and emotional, but I think I have come to terms with what did what I could do on the day. PC Ashley Walker reflecting on 7/7 ten years on. Day two of Wimbledon and much of the excitement of course centres around Andy Murray. But several other Brits have been in action today, including a couple of Londoners. Chris Slegg is in SW19. Let’s start with Wimbledon’s very own Laura Robson. It was a disappointing result for a disappointing result for Laura today, but it was a positive day. She is a positive figure. She grew UP She is a positive figure. She grew up locally and one junior Wimbledon in 2008. She was playing for the first time in 18 months due to an injury. Her last appearance was that the Australian open injanuary last year. She was beaten in straight sets by the Russian player, going down 6-4, 6-4. There were some positive moments during the match and after it I asked her what it was like being back in front of the crowd that always let her know that she is loved. I was hoping to play well. I was definitely disappointed to lose. I felt like the match was in my hands, in that I was hitting the winners but I was also hitting her shots. There is a lot to be improved on, but mostly I’m very grateful that everybody came out and supported me today. There were a couple of marriage proposals but I’m still undecided on those. While she is deciding, let’s turn to james Ward. A great opportunity forjames Ward. He is currently in action on court. This is his sixth Wimbledon appearance. He has only got to the second round on one occasion before. The player he was meant to play pulled out with an injury. He is currently playing a player that is the place is behind in the world ranking. I met up with his dad earlier and asked them what today was like for the family and whether he would prefer them to stay quiet at the courtside or get behind them. -- behind him. He does like you to cheer for him. It is like when he’s been playing for a cup, he loves everybody screaming for him. We will be cheering for him today, definitely. But we are all a little bit nervous, to be truthful with you. The expectation is for him to do very well today. I hope that he will. Opportunity beckons for james Opportunity beckons forjames Ward. You wonder how he will cope with that. One moment he was expected to be the underdog, but now he is taking on someone at a similar level. He lost the first set 7-6. He is 4-1 up at the moment. It does still have a chance of following Andy Murray through to the second round of Wimbledon later this week and what an achievement that would be for him. If you make suitable only be the second time that he has reached round two. Good luck to him. It’s not the usual sport associated with a London school. But thanks to a teacher who played Gaelic football when he was young in Ireland, pupils at Featherstone High have been inspired to take up the sport. And it turns out the team is rather good and will soon be heading to Dublin, no less, to compete. Paul Hawkins has the story. In a corner of West London, a little piece of Ireland - except that none of the youngsters keeping the spirit of the Irish national game alive here have any links to Ireland. Hi, I’m the captain of the Southall Shamrocks. I’m Indian and cricket was a huge background, but Gaelic football has taken over. It is a different sport because it combines basketball, rugby, and football and the best thing about it, I find, is that it is always at pace. It is never at a slow pace and you always have to be quick to react and it is very aggressive. It is kind of physical. It is good to play with your friends and it drains a lot of energy but it is still worth it. It is good fun. Well done, gents! And this is the man that has converted the youngsters of Featherstone High School onto Gaelic football. I played as a youngster at home in Ireland, Chris Briggs and Sean Wales, two of the teachers in PE, suggested that I ran a couple of trial games, just a taster, I suppose. The interest was huge straightaway. I was given the enthusiasm to go forward from there. That means three points in Gaelic football, but if they had kicked it over the post in a rugby-style conversion they would’ve got one point. Essentially that is what Gaelic football is about. It is a mixture of three sports, rugby, football, and basketball. Each side has 15 players and you can get it in the goal or kick it over. Such is the sport’s popularity, that the boys are off to Dublin to visit Croke Park, the home of Gaelic football, and then they will play against some of Ireland’s most promising youngsters. How much are you looking forward to going to Ireland on the tour? A lot, actually. It’s going to be quite fun and I’ll be on an aeroplane with my friends and I have never done that before. I’ve been waiting for it for a week now and I can’t wait. We serve a very diverse community here, which is 98.5% ethnic minority, largely Asian-Indian with 24% Somali intake as well. So to be exposed to these kinds of sports is fantastic for our students. The Gaelic revolution shows no signs of dying out. The success of this boys’ team has led to the girls demanding a side of their own. Let’s go back to Wimbledon - this time to join Wendy, who’s got the forecast for us. It does look glorious out there. What better way to end a beautiful sunny day that is set on the grass and watch tennis. There is a little bit of shade here for the people. When the sun sets it will be on the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures of 30 Celsius across London today. This evening it will be quite warm. We have clear skies without any clouds as we go through the night and it will take a great time for those temperatures to fall back from 30 Celsius. Some places will be in the top teams in the early hours of the morning, with some areas not getting below 20 Celsius. It will be a very warm night. We start the day tomorrow on a warm note with a bit of cloud because the humidity is rising and that could give light to one or two showers throughout the day tomorrow. Tomorrow there will be some clouds and some heaviness in the sky because of the rising humidity and rising temperatures. I think 31-32 Celsius is a good gauge across London and the Home Counties tomorrow. London could get to 34-35 Celsius. If it gets to 35 Celsius that will be the hottest day in nine years. If you join the queue in the morning for Wimbledon it will already be 22 Celsius and it will continue to rise. UV and pollen are consideration as we go through the day tomorrow. As we go through Thursday we will see some heavy showers coming from the south and it will feel fresher with the threat of showers. On the outlook, it is a return to sunny skies on Friday. There will be further funding is showers overnight into the weekend. If you are not good in the heat please take care. Now, the main headlines. Greece is put forward a deal for a lonerjust hours before its existing deal expires. It was the existing arrangement to be extended into the new Deal is arranged. 22 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the mass shooting in Tunisia. The president has admitted that the country had been taken by surprise by the attack and that an investigation was now underway into security failings. Thousands of ferry and Channel Tunnel passengers are stranded because of a strike in Calais. It’s the second time in a week French workers have walked-out. A major exercise to test how the Met Police, emergency, and security services would respond to a terrorist attack has been taking place in the capital. Scotland Yard stresses it was planned months ago and isn’t in response to any new threat. It has been the hottest day of the year so far with the temperature of 30 Celsius recorded at Heathrow Airport. More on the day’s stories on our website and Alex Bushill will be back with our late news. From all of us on the team here, thanks for watching and enjoy your evening.

Hello, welcome to The One Show with Alexjones. And Matt Baker on the hottest day of the year. This is how you have been enjoying it. We have this picture from julia Roberts who has been relaxing in her super-sized paddling pool in the garden. It is massive. It is big. We don’t know if she has got her costume on, but we love the runner beans in the background. I have been swimming today. I was scuba-diving in a swimming pool. That is where the story ends because you have been a la bunting? Yes, lucky to go to Wimbledon today. Had to leave just before Andy Murray came on. We have a show to do. We love name-dropping on The One Show, but tonight’s guest has worked with so many big names. Bill Nighy, Richard Gere, Dev Patel, Richard Gere. Matt Le Blanc. Did we say Richard Gere. But who is the star they all wanted to work with? It is Tamsin Greig. It is you. Lovely to have you back. I love the idea they are phoning their agents all of the time saying I am the one person they want to work with. They managed it. Tonight, we have got this in the studio because last time obviously, was a slightly different The One Show. There was a fire alarm of course, do you remember? Is this the only time The One Show has come off the air? It was because of you. It was because of me because I was too hot and the fire alarm went off. Let’s have a reminder. SIREN. You need to cut your hair again. I love the way there was a lot of beautiful improvising going on, ",,

Athens is braced for a stormy time, as Greece is set to become the first developed country to default on a loan from the IMF. As crowds gather to oppose more welfare cuts or tax rises, Greek ministers say a deal with creditors is still possible. We are trying to find a solution for Greece to preserve the Eurozone. We’ll have the latest from Athens, where the prospect of Greece leaving the euro is closer than ever. Also tonight: It’s thought the gunman who killed 30 Britons in Tunisia may have trained in Libya, according to officials. Will Heathrow get a third runway? The official report on airport expansion is published tomorrow. A special report from Bangladesh on the progress made in tackling poverty since the start of the millennium. The striking thing here is how the local community has been organised and empowered to tell outsiders what kind of improvements they really need. And at Wimbledon, Andy Murray starts his 2015 campaign with a straight-sets victory. On BBC London: A mock terror attack on the capital as police and emergency services test their ability to respond. And a mother and her teenage daughter have been found dead at their home in Esher. Good evening. Greece isjust an hour away from missing a repayment on a major loan, raising the prospect of a formal default and possible exit from the euro. Athens was meant to repay more than £1 billion to the International Monetary Fund by 11 o’clock tonight. But the Greek government has already said that’s not going to happen. A short while ago, Greek ministers asked for the repayment deadline to be extended, as our Europe editor Katya Adler reports. Tension was high in Athens today, with people here acutely aware that their future hangs in the balance. The streets here were alive with talk of a new Greek proposal to its creditors and a possible deal around the corner. These demonstrators gathered close to Parliament, shouting a loud yes to Europe and the euro. The skies above may be stormy, but that hasn’t dampened the passion of these protesters. They are been shouting, ""We are staying in Europe, yes, yes, yes!"" They disagree with their government on that, the priority here isjust make sure that Greece stays inside the Eurozone. The important thing is to be in Europe, share the European values. This is what is at stake in Greece at this moment. Greece belongs to Europe. We need the Europe because we are a poor country. Greece is about to get even poorer with the official end tonight of its current bailout deal. The Greek Prime Minister called his Cabinet together for an urgent meeting, but in public, at least, the message was tirelessly upbeat. If you were a betting man, could there still be a deal before Sunday? The EU always sorts things out at one minute before midnight. Do you think that it is likely yet again we will find a solution one minute before midnight? I think there is a good probability that that will happen. But a last-minute deal between Greece and its creditors is as yet nowhere in sight. Earlier in the day, in this less well healed part of town, we found shoppers indifferent to political rumours. Here, reality bites. People were working out what they could or couldn’t afford to buy. This man is trying to sell these cherries, and he is now selling them for 1.50. Most of the customers see fruit as a luxury with cash so tight. A luxury the Greek government doesn’t have is time and the way ahead looks threatening. Huge payments are due to Greece’s creditors, the country risks falling out of the Eurozone and there is a referendum on Sunday that could be the make-or-break of the Greek Prime Minister’s career. Katya Adler, BBC News, Athens. So this is the critical timetable for Greece and the eurozone. In an hour’s time, Greece is set to miss the deadline for a 1.6 billion euro payment to the IMF. This coming Sunday, Greeks will vote in a referendum on a proposed new package of tax rises and welfare cuts. And in a few weeks’ time, Greece is due to make an even bigger payment of 3.4 billion euros to the European Central Bank. We’ll discuss those figures in a moment with our economics editor, Robert Peston, but first, live to Athens for the latest with Katya Adler. How much should we read into this proposed last-minute deal, Katya, or should we wait for the referendum on Sunday? Well, this is not the way things normally go, Huw, in international diplomacy. The Greek government has spent the last five months accused by its creditors of being ill-prepared, ill-advised and not serious about negotiations to try and keep Greece away from bankruptcy, but inside the Eurozone. Then, as we said, hours before the bailout deal expires, and a huge bill is owed to the IMF, frantic activity, the proposalfor a new third bailout deal, a late-night appeal by the Deputy Prime Minister for an extension to the IMF loan and a rumour that that referendum on Sunday, disapproved of by the creditors, could still be cancelled. It is not laughable. In the end, this is about people’s lives, it is about the future of Greece and the Eurozone as a whole. Eurozone finance ministers will talk to each other again by telephone tomorrow to decide how best to proceed. And our economics editor, Robert Peston, is with me now. How do you rate the prospects of Greece staying within the Eurozone? Let’s look at this default that we will get in an hour’s time. It was embarrassing enough for Greece to seek a bailout from the IMF in 2010 and 2012. How much more humiliating to be the first developed economy to fail to make a due payment, putting it on a par with Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe and the Afghanistan of the Taliban. The reason it matters in an economic sense is because it puts the European Central Bank firmly on the spot. The European Central Bank turned off additionalfunding the spot. The European Central Bank turned off additional funding for Greek banks on Sunday. And that was why Greek banks had to close on the Monday. However, the default under the ECB’s rules means that it now has to decide, in effect, whether to demand some of its money back from those banks. Now, by changing what is known as the collateral requirements. If it were to do that, possibly one bank at that point wouldn’t just possibly one bank at that point wouldn’tjust be frozen, as is currently the case, but would be bust. That would be a serious escalation of this crisis. It would tip Greece even further towards the euro exit, which is why we have got this frantic attempt by the Greek government, as we have heard from Katya, to re-open negotiations on a possible further bailout. Angela Merkel has said she’s not having any of it until after the referendum so, right now, if you are in Greece, or in any part of the Eurozone, you are right to be feeling extremely anxious. Thank you. The Tunisian gunman who carried out the attack on tourists last Friday, killing 38 people, trained in a jihadist camp in Libya, according to the Tunisian government. Most of Seifeddine Rizgui’s victims were British. The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said today that the spread of so-called Islamic State into the ""ungoverned territory"" of Libya had sown the seeds of last week’s atrocity. Our correspondent orla Guerin is in the resort of Sousse, where the attack took place. Security along the coast is due to be stepped up tomorrow, with the deployment of 1,000 armed officers to reinforce the tourism police. They will be going on duty as families in Britain prepare to receive their dead. Tunisia’s President has said the country needs help controlling its borders, especially with Libya. The authorities here say they have made significant progress in their investigation into the attack, but they have revealed few details. A reassuring presence in Sousse today, but Tunisia’s president has admitted the security forces were caught off-guard by the massacre on the shore. That’s in spite of the attack on tourists at a museum in the capital three months ago. TRANSLATION: It’s true we were surprised, said President Beji Essebsi. The security forces made provision for Ramadan and were to tighten procedures, starting tomorrow. We never thought things would happen on the beach. And here is the master student who carried out a massacre. This is the latest image to emerge of Seifeddine Rizgui. It’s a snap from his university. Police here are building a picture of his movements before the attack. A top security official says he attended ajihadi camp in neighbouring Libya about six months ago, at the same time as the men who stormed the museum. Several alleged accomplices have already been arrested, and these men, said to be friends of the killer, are on the wanted list. Mohammed Al Sharadi is a 2lI-year-old student from Northern Tunisia. And Rafiq Al Talari, from Tunis, is 28. Go inside, go inside... As Rizgui was taking lives, this man was saving them, shepherding tourists into his shop. The people, they stay here and here and here. One woman, she has two little children. I said, OK, you don’t talk anything... He kept 30 people hidden here, Britons among them. Those seriously injured in the attack have been flown home, carefully tended by the RAF. The Foreign Secretary said they were victims in part of the chaos in Libya, exploited by Islamic State, though he insisted it wasn’t a mistake for Britain to have helped oust Colonel Gaddafi. As ISIL has spread across this space, it has posed a threat to us and the neighbouring countries, which we have seen realised in this attack in Tunisia. 22 Britons are now confirmed dead. Holiday-makers whojust wanted some summer sun, among them several couples killed side by side. Tomorrow, the first of the bodies will begin their final journey home. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Sousse. In London, the Foreign Office has now confirmed the identities of 22 British tourists who died in the attack, but the number is likely to rise to 30. The process of repatriating the bodies will start tomorrow. As part of their response to the attack, ministers have given more details of their plans to combat extremism among young people here in the UK, as our political editor Nick Robinson reports. Do not adjust your set. This is a street in Central London today, but it’s not real. Planned many months ago, it’s an exercise designed to test how ready the emergency and other services are for a major terror attack, of the sort last seen here a decade ago. Of course if it ever gets to this stage, it is much too late, which is why the Government say they are not just looking at security measures, but they’re also investigating how to make sure people with extreme views don’t become people who carry out violent acts. What are the risks of social media? Today, teachers were asked by ministers to monitor their pupils for signs of extremism, just as they already look out for signs of child abuse. We’re not asking them to be the police. We are asking them to perhaps raise with their head teacher or head of their department - look, this person said something to me that seemed to me to be a bit unusual, do you think this is something we should report to the local authority, or to the police or to the Department for Education? Are you saying if teachers and others correct the behaviour of a seven or an eight-year-old, we might stop a shooting on the streets of Britain? It is of course always possible. What we are saying as well, we may very well stop people travelling, putting themselves and others in danger. This document spells out the tell-tale signs that a pupil is looking at potential terrorist propaganda. The teaching unions say that their members do not have the skills and that, besides, it is not theirjob. Teachers cannot be turned into, as it were, spies in the classroom. What they have to do is afford opportunity for discussion, and put the counterarguments where they need to, but not close down the space so that children don’t even come in to have those discussions. From tomorrow, a new law will oblige notjust schools, but prisons and hospitals, universities and colleges to prevent what is called extremist radicalisation taking place within their walls. At Britain’s largest mosque in South London there was a welcome, albeit a cautious one, for this new law. Anything we can do to hinder the forward movement of terrorist extremism, that is something we should do. I mean, everyone is entitled to a viewpoint, right? As long as he is not physically harming others with that viewpoint, he is entitled to hold it. This is a chilling sight. Even though what looked like the wounded are in fact perfectly healthy volunteers, of course, one day, they might not be. In Tunisia, security is being increased at major venues, and many mosques suspected of fomenting trouble are being closed. Tunisia has a strong democratic tradition but there are concerns that its proximity to troubled Libya make it vulnerable to Islamist extremism. Our special correspondent Fergal Keane has been investigating. Everywhere we we nt, Everywhere we went, the message was the same. You are welcome in Tunisia. Out of the crowds, voices pleading for understanding. You have mY pleading for understanding. You have my origin and I have my origin but together we live. We love God’s people. This woman is a 30-year-old nurse treating some of the wounded from the attack and she has approached tourists in the old city asking for forgiveness. Why do you feel the need to apologise? TRANSLATION: I apologise because as a Tunisian I feel guilty that the attack happened here. It has hurt the image of Tunisia and other countries. Ifeela the image of Tunisia and other countries. Ifeel a lot of the image of Tunisia and other countries. I feel a lot of pain. countries. Ifeel a lot of pain. I don’t want the rest of the world to consider us as terrorists.

The long-awaited decision on the best way to expand airport capacity in the South East of England will be revealed tomorrow. The recommendations of the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, follow a long and hard-fought campaign by both Heathrow and Gatwick. There’s speculation that a new runway at Heathrow will be the commission’s first choice. Our business editor, Kamal Ahmed, is here. ~ I know you’ve been talking to people throughout the day and evening. If thatis throughout the day and evening. If that is true, if it is the first is coming he threw, can we take it as read that this is what will happen at the end of the day? -- read that this is what will happen at the end of the day? -- Heathrow. This is one of the foremost political issues. My aviation sources all believe that Sir Howard will plump for a third runway at Heathrow but that does not mean that the deal is anywhere near being done. And why is that? The reason is, the economic case and the political case are somewhat different. Many people believe Heathrow has the better economic case. If it is expanded, morejobs will come to the UK, it will have more trade opportunities with links around the world and it is closer to London physically than Gatwick is. It’s also closer to the other big conurbations in the UK. Cardiff, Bristol, Manchester, the aviation routes to the North. The Chancellor, for example, is known to be sympathetic towards Heathrow and many businesses back Heathrow as the place for expansion. But it is controversial. More houses will be demolished if Heathrow is expanded. More noise impact, because more people live near Heathrow, and, of course, the environmental impact of having more planes over London. Borisjohnson has said he will fight until the final ditch to stop Heathrow being expanded. So Gatwick less controversial. I think Sir Howard is being clever here as I think he will say that Gatwick, although not the winning option, is still a credible one, which means politicians could still choose it. I will leave you with two final thoughts on a rather cramped approached aviation expansion in the UK. The last time the south-east of England saw a new full-length runway being built was the 1940s. And whatever politicians decide on Sir Howard’s commission report, which they probably will announce in the autumn, it will surely Billy Bob be over ten years before it is up and running. -- over ten years before it is up and running. -- it will surely be over ten years. Thank you. There have been more difficulties in Calais after striking ferry workers closed the port and blocked Eurotunnel rail services. Thousands of passengers were stranded at one point, and both Eurostar and Shuttle services were suspended because of fire on the tracks. P&O Ferries said security at Calais had been ""abandoned"". The UK Government said the situation in Calais was completely unacceptable, as correspondent Lucy Williamson reports. The tracks that link Britain and France closed today to everyone - tourists, truck drivers, even migrants. This time, the illegal occupiers of the Channel Tunnel were its employees, protesting Eurotunnel’s sale of its cross-Channel ferry service with the loss of hundreds ofjobs. TRANSLATION: I would say that our objectives will be to block the strategic points which means it could be the Tunnel, the highways, the harbour, Dunkirk harbour. Everything that could allow us to change things, to put pressure on the government. The queue of vehicles snaking back into France created new chances for migrants to climb on board. But this time, police were ready. British security fences have helped separate Calais’ ports from the migrant camps around it. Now Britain is sending more fencing to build a similar corridor here, at the vulnerable entrance to the Channel Tunnel. This was once a problem of logistics, of local tensions, economic loss. Now it’s the tip of a political iceberg, a growing community in limbo and whose future hangs over every capital in Europe. Solving this means solving the dreams and needs of vast numbers of people. Here, they’re migrants. Back home, they’re law students, teachers, husbands, sons. Lucy Williamson, BBC News, Calais. 15 years ago the United Nations marked the new millennium with a series of pledges to improve the lives of the world’s poorest people. The Millennium Development Goals were ambitious - eight separate targets covering a number of areas, including reducing poverty, improving education and health care. This year marks the date for the goals to be met. Progress has been mixed but Bangladesh is one country that’s made big gains. In the first of a series of reports on Millennium Goals this week, Mishal Husain is in the capital, Dhaka. We’ve come to Bangladesh because it is one of the biggest recipients of British overseas aid. £190 million in this financial year alone. But also because the UN targets provided a blueprint for its investment efforts and 15 years on Bangladesh will meet several of the Millennium Development Goals or is on track to do so. And in one poor part of Dhaka, I’ve been seeing how the power of decision-making lies not in the hands of the big eight donors but local people. -- aid donors. In the middle of Dhaka’s richest district, the slum of Korail, a shanty town that has sprung up on the edge of a lake. It’s home to nearly a quarter of a million people packed into these small alleys. Many came here in search of a better life but it is a basic and poor existence. This is a tough place to live, but even five years ago conditions here were much worse. Aid money has been used to help the residents of Korail, and the striking thing here is how the local community has been organised and empowered to tell outsiders what kind of improvements they really need and how the money should be spent. Setting up this creche was one of those decisions. The women of Korail said they needed it so they could go out to work. The community leader showed me a project that she’s overseen. These are the toilets you built? British aid helped to pay for these, and she says everyone has benefited. TRANSLATION: This place used to be a rubbish dump. Dogs and cats were living here. People used the place as a toilet. A lot of our children got ill because of that. Then we decided to build these toilets. These have made a big difference to our lives. But it’s a question of livelihood as well as life. The community leaders also help to identify those in need of loans, often used to start small businesses. This woman has been living in Korail ever since she left her husband 11 yâ8IâS 890. TRANSLATION: He used to beat me up really badly but I tried hard to live with him. After my first child was born I thought, let’s try again for the ba by’s sa ke. But he carried on beating me. He burned my skin with a cigarette and cut my finger off. He even tried to gouge my eyes out. Finally I decided, no more. With the help of a small loan she set up her shop. It’s gone from strength to strength. TRANSLATION: The loan has changed my life. Before, I had very little. Now I have money I can pay for my rent and my daughter’s education. I can even wear nice clothes and I have a mobile phone. The children who live here have benefited from the development of the slum but Bangladesh still has tens of millions of people living below the poverty line. Transforming their life chances is an immense task. And we will have more on the EU United Nations progress in the next few days. On the second day of Wimbledon 2015, Britain’s Andy Murray easily won his first match of the tournament, despite the temperatures on court exceeding 40 degrees at one stage. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss was watching the play. It was a day when the key was keeping your cool, whether you were Andy Murray arriving for duty, or the fans preparing for the scorching sunshine. Forget the Pimm’s, today’s biggest queues were for the water fountains, sojust how hot is it? Sweltering. It is relentless. Melting. It is like being a fried egg on a hot rock. To give you an idea of what it is like, I’m here on Centre Court and play hasn’t even started yet and already, according to the official thermometer, it is more than 40 degrees in the sunshine and it is getting hotter all the time. And by mid-afternoon, Murray was being made to sweat. Inspired since his marriage in April, he’s taken to tying his wedding ring to his shoelaces, but Mikhail Kukushkin had little room for sentiment. After losing the first set, he roared back, before Murray located his magic, taking a tie-break in swashbuckling style. And from there, Murray rounded things off. A few awkward moments, but a straight-sets win and a solid start. It was some day for the home players, with victories forjames Ward and Aljaz Bedene. Bedene, born in Slovenia, only got his British passport in March, but beating Radek Stepanek wasn’t a bad way to introduce himself. And Heather Watson saved three match-points before knocking out the seeded Caroline Garcia. For the British fans, a sizzling day but a successful one. Andy Swiss, BBC News, Wimbledon. That’s all from us. Now on BBC One it’s time for the news where you are. Welcome to BBC London News with me, Alex Bushill. This is Operation Strong Tower. Six months in the planning and the largest counter-terrorism exercise the country’s ever seen. Roads were closed to allow police, the army and emergency services to rehearse their response to a mock multiple shooting in the capital. Our home affairs correspondent, Nick Beake, watched the exercise unfold. It’s the chilling sight London hopes it will never see, armed terrorists on the loose, determined to kill. Today, this is the nightmare scenario in the biggest terrorist exercise ever held in the capital. GUNFIRE SCREAMS ",,
184,BBC1 London,7-jun-2015,BBC News,13:00,15 mins,True,"Good afternoon. The BBC has seen evidence that the former Fifa Vice-President, jack Warner, personally benefited from $10 million given by South Africa to pay for football development in the Caribbean. The documents suggest Mr Warner used the payments for cash withdrawals, personal loans, and to launder money. He denies any wrongdoing. This exclusive report from Ed Thomas in Trinidad and Tobago contains some flash photography. Morning, Mr Warner. It is the $10 million question at the centre of Fifa’s global bribery scandal. The £10 million, where did it go? Cash promised by South Africa. And sent to this man, the former Fifa Vice-President, jack Warner. Can you tell us where the $10 million went, jack? Mr Warner, where did the $10 million go to? Can you tell us one project, Mr Warner? Can you tell us about one project that you spent the money on? US investigators have questions too because they believe the money was a bribe. jack Warner doesn’t want to talk about the missing millions, but our investigation has uncovered this. Detailed information that reveals for the first time where every dollar of the Fifa money was spent and moved around. Seen exclusively by BBC News, the wire transfers from Fifa’s Zurich account, $10 million sent to accounts controlled byjack Warner, money used for cash withdrawals, credit card payments and alleged money laundering schemes. First, consider this place, the jTA Supermarkets chain. Nearly $5 million came through here and there is not a football pitch in sight. These documents reveal that from january 2008 to March 2009 $4,860,000 was transferred to jTA Supermarkets. US prosecutors say that money was then paid back to jack Warner in local currency. Now, consider the cash and credit card payments. These papers show $360,000 of the Fifa money was withdrawn by people connected to jack Warner. And then there is this. $1.6 million in personal loans and payments to Warner’s credit cards. $10 million sent by Fifa at the request of South Africa. Money spent by Warner with no obvious checks or balances. We presented our investigation to Brent Sancho, Trinidad and Tobago’s Sports Minister, and former footballer. I’m devastated. A lot of that money should be back in football. What should happen to jack Warner? With this evidence, he has dodged a bullet too many times and it is time for him to answer for his actions. South Africa didn’t give me a $10 million bribe... jack Warner denies all corruption and says he is an innocent scapegoat who will soon reveal the truth of what happened inside Fifa. Nearly 3,500 migrants attempting to reach Europe from Libya have been rescued in the Mediterranean. They were found in boats and dinghies drifting about A5 miles from the African coast. The Royal Navy ship, HMS Bulwark, which is helping to rescue migrants, is involved in helping four boats carrying about 500 people. The Italian coastguard, which co-ordinates rescue efforts from Rome, said it had received ten distress calls. The leaders of some of the world’s most powerful nations have gathered in southern Germany. The G7 summit at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps is expected to focus on issues including Ukraine, Islamic State, and climate change. Our correspondent, jenny Hill, is in Bavaria now. All morning military aircraft have been ferrying the world leaders up and down the mountainside behind me. One man who isn’t here is Vladimir Putin, who was excluded from this group last year after he an exed Crimea. But in the words of one German newspaper, Mr Putin may not be at the table but he is setting the agenda. It is not often international dip lopecy is conducted over beer and wurst, but this is how it is done in Bavaria. We are going to discuss our shared future. The global economy that creates jobs and opportunity, maintaining a strong and prosperous European Union, forging new trade partnerships across the Atlantic. Standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Because, as the Prime Ministers and presidents flew in, it is the leader they kicked out who will dominate the summit. Vladimir Putin’s actions in Crimea and now Ukraine are high on the agenda. This summit is widely seen as a chance to discuss ongoing sanctions against Russia, but the leaders will also talk about the global terrorism situation, issues like Libya, Syria, even the debt crisis in Greece. The setting may be fairy-tale, the agenda is anything but. So what’s this freshly re-elected Prime Minister’s plan? My message here is very clear. Britain is back. We’ve got a growing economy. We’ve got our deficit coming down. We are creating jobs at a record level, and Britain doesn’tjust want a jobs at a record level, and Britain doesn’t just want a strong economy. We want to engage with these issues of international security. Ultimately as G7 President it is Angela Merkel who is in charge. On her agenda, Angela Merkel who is in charge. On heragenda, climate her agenda, climate change and global health. Much to discuss. And what’s said here in Bavaria may resonate world white. Ss. And what’s said here in Bavaria may resonate world white -- worldwide. More than 50 Conservative MPs, including former Cabinet Ministers Owen Paterson and john Redwood, have formed a group called Conservatives for Britain to put pressure on David Cameron to secure fundamental changes to Britain’s relationship with the EU. This morning the Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, told the BBC that one of those changes, the idea of the House of Commons having a unilateral veto on EU legislation, was not achievable because it would effectively be the end of the EU. The theme park, Alton Towers, remains closed as investigators continue to examine the cause of a rollercoaster accident on Monday in which four people suffered serious leg injuries. Lawyers for one of the victims, Victoria Balch, say she’s had another operation. Mo Farah has pulled out of today’s athletics meeting in Birmingham saying he’s been ""emotionally and physically drained"" following doping allegation surrounding his coach, Alberto Salazar. Yesterday Farah said he was angry his name had been ""dragged through the mud"". There’s no suggestion that Mo Farah has done anything wrong, and Alberto Salazar has strongly denied all of the claims. David Orstein reports. The Alexander stadium in Birmingham. This is where Mo Farah, the poster boy of British athletics, was supposed to compete today. He was scheduled to run in the 1,500 metres, the final race of the day. Backin metres, the final race of the day. Back in the city where he broke the two myelin door world record in February, the star name of the Diamond League meeting, the big draw for the fans. Mo’s coming to Birmingham, screamed the headlines. Well, he came, but a not for long. Farah pulled out this morning as the fallout over allegations over doping of his coach Alex Salmond and another continues. There is no suggestion Farah has done anything wrong. In a statement, the double Olympic champion said: Farah’s withdrawal follows Fa rah’s withdrawal follows an and emotional news conference on Saturday. My name’s getting dragged through the mud and it is not fair. I’m angry. I need answers. If they turn out to be true, and Alberto has crossed the line, I’m the first person to leave him. Farah fully intended to fulfil his commitment here, underlining his belief that this controversy has nothing to do with him. But clearly he felt the matter had become so serious that it needed to be dealt with urgently. Whatever the outcome of that, this is the most unwelcome of crises for Mo Farah, British athletics and the sport as a whole. You can see more on all of today’s stories on the BBC News Channel. The next news on BBC One is at six. Bye for now. Good afternoon. We’ve had a real mix of weather types over the past week or so. Humid weather with thunderstorms on Friday. Gales on Saturday. A Sunday is proving a quieter end to the week. This coming week we keep with the quieter spell of dry weather. Sunshine around. Chilly nights and we are likely to see a return to rain at the end of the week. Almost gin clear skies for some areas. Fair weather cloud here and there this afternoon. North-western Scotland, cloud and outbreaks of rain here. Low pressure is towards the north-east. High pressure building in from the west is leading to largely settled conditions. Blustery across northern Scotland, with showery outbreaks of rain, heaviest on the hills in the west. South-west Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England, one or two isolated showers, but a lot of dry and bright weather. Temperatures in the mid teens. In the of England and Wales, a fine afternoon. Temperatures 0 or 21 degrees at best. Plenty of sunshine. Lighter winds compared to recent days. This evening, many of us end the day on a dry note with late sunshine. Pretty breezy with showers introduce the north-east of Scotland, but elsewhere the winds fall light overnight. Clear skies as well, so that’s the recipe for a chilly night. These are the overnight lows in towns and cities. 7 to 10 degrees. But in the countryside temperatures could be a few degrees above freezing. Monday morning, a few isolated pockets of grass frost. It could be cool and breezy around the south-east coasts of England. Showers in eastern and northern England. Cooler in the east compared to today. Further west, England. Cooler in the east compared to today. Furtherwest, dry to today. Further west, dry and fine with sunshine. High pressure becomes well and truly established through Monday, so we end Monday afternoon and evening on a largely dry note. Isolated showers easing their way towards the south and social workers into the evening hours. But overnight Monday and into Tuesday, for most of us it is a dry and chilly start. High pressure, so not a lot of isobars. For most of us light winds, the winds rotating around the high pressure, gusty examines for a time around the channel coast. Cool for the likes of Norwich at 13 degrees. Tuesday, another largely dry day with sunshine but cooler than we could expect for this time of year. No changes into Wednesday. High pressure is in charge, so sunny spells. A bit of cloud building. Temperatures at 14 to 20 degrees. Rain trying to push into the far north. That’s the story into the middle part of the week. Weather fronts trying to push into the far north, but turning unsettled from the south. Rain pushing in from some southern counties during Thursday. There is the potential it could be heavy and thundery. Ahead of it warmer is is in charge. Many places have temperatures on the rise. Low pressure shifting in from the south. Uncertainty about where it is going to be sitting but it looks like the southern half of the UK could see heavy downpours and the risk of thunder storms. Northern areas staying drier through Friday. Welcome to Escape To The Country. These magnificent medieval buildings are built on the foundations of England’s oldest charity. And for some 600 years, they’ve been home to 25 brothers. So, in which county would you find a Grade I listed gem like this that you can actually call home? Well, stay tuned and I’ll tell you. On today’s show I’m helping a mother and daughter who are joining forces to find their perfect forever home in the country. 'There’s no holding back in bagging the best rooms] This room’s lovely. This is mine. Oh, really? And the thatched roof hits the spot. Oh! Isn’t that gorgeous? It’s beautiful. Well, today, we’re in Hampshire, and this is the magnificent aerial view of the Hospital of St Cross on the outskirts of Winchester. It was founded back in the 12th century by the grandson of William the Conqueror, Henry de Blois, and he had two real aims. The first was to demonstrate his piety, but the second was to set up a community that would care for men who really found themselves with nowhere else to go. In time, they became known as the Brothers of St Cross. In the 15th century, a man called Cardinal Beaufort added the buildings you can now see below me, that wonderful range of almshouses with their tall chimneys. Later on in the show, I’ll be back here finding out what life is like for the brothers who still call this home in the 21st century. But in the meantime, here’s a little taster of what the rest of Hampshire has to offer. Set on the south coast of England, Hampshire is bordered by five counties including Wiltshire to the West, and Surrey to the east. To the north-east of the county, much of the surrounding landscape makes up part of the North Wessex Downs, a protected Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Rising in the mid-Hampshire Downs is the River Itchen, a classic chalk river and designated a Special Area of Conservation, flowing through Winchester on its way to the Solent. Part of Hampshire’s southern landscape is encompassed within the South Downs National Park, dotted with beautiful villages such as East Meon, set on the Meon River, and Buriton, both characterised by traditional thatched-roof cottages. Whether it’s the lure of the cathedral city of historic Winchester, or the quiet contemplation of its majestic countryside, Hampshire is a county that has something for everyone. Now, when it comes to the housing market here, Hampshire’s hot spots have pushed up the price of your average detached property tojust under £350,000. And you could pay even more than that if you step inside the borders of the New Forest National Park, or you fancy a slice of pretty little villages such as Stockbridge or Broughton. But if you want a bit more value for money, head north in the county towards Andover. There, you could knock off as much as 25%. This is all good news for today’s buyers. So, let’s meet them, find out what they are after, and crucially, how much they want to spend. Tired of their busy, urban lifestyles in Surrey and Cardiff, Anna, husband jake, and her mother Sheila have decided to combine their resources into a large, family home in the country. The last six years jake and I have had a house on a main road in Woking, and it’s always a bit worrying with the cat and that sort of thing. But actually we really look forward to some peace, and want to move out to the countryside, live more in a village location, pooling our resources with Mum to get a place, the three of us together, with the animals. The animals are very important. We’ve got Mum’s dog and our cat. I was widowed last year and I don’t like living on my own. After 40 years, it’s hard. And we get on really well, and I get on particularly well with my son-in-law. But, having lived in the Cardiff area for around 25 years, the last 11 in Penarth Marina, Sheila feels the time is right to move on. The whole of the Marina is a concrete jungle, and Ijust... I’m ready to have my own space, I think. ",,

A Royal Navy warship, HMS Bulwark has rescued at least five hundred migrants off the coast of Libya. The ship was sent to the Mediterranean by the government, to help the rescue effort for migrants whose boats run into difficulty trying to cross from Libya to Italy. More than 43,000 people have already crossed the Mediterranean this year- a 50% increase on last year’s numbers. And its estimated that more than 1,600 people have drowned so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. Our Defence Correspondent, jonathan Beale hasjust sent this report from onboard HMS Bulwark. At first light, HMS bulwark launched one of her helicopters to search for the boats filled with migrants. It didn’t take long to find them. Up on the bridge, the ship prepared to launch her own boat to begin the rescue.

It seems to be part of an unstoppable tide of people leaving Africa, trying to reach Europe. President obama has urged fellow leaders from the G7 group of industrialised nations to stand up to what he called Russian aggression in Ukraine. He’s attending the G7 summit in the Bavarian Alps. Also this afternoon, David Cameron said Britain is to send a further 125 Army trainers to Iraq - to help in the fight against so-called Islamic State extremists. From there, our Diplomatic Correspondent, james Robbins, reports. It doesn’t get more Bavarian than this. A whole alpine village turned out for President obama. He wanted to shake every hand. Chancellor Merkel despaired of keeping control of her most powerful guest. Despite all this good cheer, leaders of some of the world ‘s key powers are confronting daunting threats. VI/oI’I’y I’IUITIiJâIâ OFIEZ Russia destabilising Ukraine. And a warning to Moscow. If anyone wants to start a debate, about changing the sanctions regime, the discussion could only be about strengthening it. David Cameron is delighted with that toughness, and he is using this summit to counter Washington’s fears of shrinking Britain, spending less on defence, retreating from global leadership. No, he says, Britain is back. Whenever I come to one of these gatherings, what’s on my mind is the jobs and security of British people and that means a strong Britain engaged in the world and that’s exactly what we are. To underline that, the Prime Minister is announcing this evening Britain will send up to 125 extra troops to Iraq to counter so-called Islamic State. They’ll not be going into battle directly, but train Iraq’s own army, much mocked whenever it has lost ground to the extremists. There is a sense of global threat on many fronts at this summit, for us reporters, even getting close to the leaders means getting a lift from the German military, to a mountain castle, sealed off with massive force. These summits are vastly expensive, critics say ludicrously extravagant. At least the total seclusion of this Alpine schloss allows the leaders an opportunity to psych each other up, to persuade themselves they have too hard their resolve in a very dangerous world. Still to come on a very demanding agenda: Threats from climate change, global pandemics, and extremist violence. These leaders of the rich world accept it’s the poor who suffer the most. They have the means to do more, they insist they will also show the collective will. More than 50 Conservative MPs have formed a group aimed at putting pressure on David Cameron to go much further in securing fundamental changes to Britain’s relationship with the European Union. They say unless that is achieved, Britain should leave the EU. Live now to Westminster and our Political Correspondent, Carole Walker. How much How ITIUCi’I pI’âSSUI’â the Prime Minister from this group? Well, the conservative battle lines on this are becoming much clearer, that group of Eurosceptics are demanding, for example, that the British Parliament should have the right to issue a red card to veto EU legislation, something the Foreign Secretary has said is not achievable and not on the table. Prompting Steve Baker, a founding member of the group, to say that’s why we need to be ready to campaign to leave the European Union. David Cameron will negotiate a better deal and campaign to stayin, is the fear. It’s been made clear Cabinet ministers will be expected to toe the line, to support and vote for government policy. Furthermore, that they’ll have the backing of the civil service. It’s opened up a further rift with the Eurosceptics, who say it unprecedented and unfair of civil servants to ta ke unprecedented and unfair of civil servants to take sides in a referendum. Alton Towers, which closed after a rollercoaster crash seriously injured four people, will re-open tomorrow morning. Two carriages on The Smiler rollercoaster crashed into each other on Tuesday. The ride, and some others, will remain closed. Mo Farah has pulled out of an athletics meeting in Birmingham, saying he is ""emotionally and physically drained"" following doping allegations surrounding his coach. Yesterday Farah said he was angry his name has been ""dragged through the mud."" There’s no suggestion he has done anything wrong - and the coach, Alberto Salazar, has strongly denied all of the claims. David ornstein reports. The Alexander Stadium in Birmingham. This is where Mo Farah, the poster boy of British athletics, was supposed to compete today. Mo Farah breaks the world record! The star of the show back in the city where he broke records in February. It was he who the crowds came to see. Instead, they would arrive to news of Farah’s withdrawal, as the fallout over allegations of doping against his coach, Alberto Salazar, and training partner Galen Rupp, continued. Salazar and Rupp deny the allegations and there is no suggestion Farah has done anything wrong. In a statement, the double olympic champion said... Farah’s decision followed an angry and emotional news conference yesterday. My name is getting dragged through the mud. And it’s not fair, I’m angry. I need answers. If they turn out to be true, these things, Alberto has crossed a line. I’m the first person to leave him. His absence today didn’t go down well with spectators. It would have been nice to see him here, you know, it’s what people come here to see. It is a shame, obviously we wanted to come and see Mo today, we do feel sorry for him and I hope it all clears up. Surprised about his decision, thought if he was going to pull out he would have done it earlier. There was disappointment, too, from fellow athletes. Everybody understands he is emotionally and physically drained, he has to be after everything he’s gone through, so he wouldn’t have run at his best. But he could have run, he could have come and watched, just walked around and been here to show to the fans of the people who came to watch him, yes, I’m here. Farah was meant to run here in the men’s 1500 metres. But it took place without him because he was on a flight to the United States. He wants answers from Alberto Salazar. As Mo Farah, British Athletics, and the sport as a whole face a most unwelcome of crises. Football- and England played Ireland in Dublin today - their first trip to the city since 1995 - when a riot caused the match to be abandoned. It was an uneventful match off the pitch - and on the pitch as well- the match ended in a goalless draw. Tennis - and there was a surprise at the men’s final at the French open this afternoon. Stan Wawrinka - the Swiss number 8 seed - beat favourite Novak Djokovic in four sets. It’s the third time Djokovic has lost in three French open finals. Adam Wild has this report. To France, and a career grand slam. That was the plan for world number one Novak Djokovic. just Stanislas Wawrinka left in the way. A relatively straightforward first set for the Serb, and relatively straightforward first set forthe Serb, and he for the Serb, and he seemed comfortable, but the Swiss is in the form of his life. Recovering from a quick tantrum at the net, you needed one set points to level. Djokovic’s grip on the match spiralling out of control. Wawrinka was only getting stronger, a break on the Djokovic serve proving his dominance. With both players feeling pressure, breaks were becoming a regular occurrence, a huge backhand winner by Wawrinka left him serving for the set. Djokovic saved one match point, but Wawrinka held his nerve. A second grand slam in as many years. For Djokovic, history will have to wait for another year. Analysis of that match on the BBC sport website now. And more through the evening on the BBC News Channel. Goodbye. Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The family of Mark Duggan - whose shooting by police sparked riots 4 years ago - have called for upon Home Secretary to launch a ‘judge-led’ public inquiry into his death. Last year, Mr Duggan’s relatives lost their attempt to overturn an inquest verdict - which found his shooting by police was ‘lawful’. ",,
187,BBC1 London,7-jun-2015,BBC News,22:00,20 mins,True,"Documents show how the former Fifa vice president jack Warner benefited personally from a $10 million payment. The ten million dollars, jack, where did it go? The money, sent on behalf of South Africa, was meant to go to grassroots projects in the Caribbean. Instead, documents suggest it was used for cash withdrawals, personal loans, and to launder money. Mr Warner, who’s been indicted by the FBI for corruption, denies wrongdoing. Also tonight: More than a thousand migrants are rescued by a Royal Navy warship off the coast of Libya. President Obama joins talks in Germany, saying he hopes Britain will stay in the European Union. And the hour is out! Bradley Wiggins has done it! And Britain’s top cyclist smashes the world record for the distance covered in one hour. Good evening. The BBC has seen evidence that the former Fifa vice-president, jack Warner, personally benefited from $10 million given by South Africa to pay for football development in the Caribbean. The documents suggest Mr Warner used the payments for cash withdrawals, personal loans, and to launder money. He denies any wrongdoing. This exclusive report from Ed Thomas in Trinidad and Tobago contains some flash photography. Good morning, Mr Warner. Good morning, MrWarner. It’s the $10 million question at the centre of football’s global bribery scandal. The $10 million, where did it go? Cash promised by South Africa and sent via Fifa to this man, former Fifa vice president jack Warner. Tell us where the $10 million went. Mr Warner, Tell us where the $10 million went. MrWarner, can million went. Mr Warner, can you tell us one project? Tell us about one project you spent the money on. US investigators have questions as well because they believe the money was a bribe, to guarantee that South Africa would host the World Cup. jack Warner doesn’t want to talk about the missing millions but our investigation has uncovered this. Detailed information that reveals for the first time where every dollar of the Fifa money was spent and moved around. Seen exclusively by BBC News, the wire transfers from Fifa, $10 million sent to accounts controlled byjack Warner. Money that South Africa claims was for Caribbean football, its Caribbean football, its so-called diaspora legacy programme. But the documents show it was used for cash withdrawals, credit cards and alleged money-laundering. First, consider this place, jTA Supermarkets. Nearly $5 million was paid to its headquarters, and there’s not a football pitch in sight. These documents reveal that from january 2008 to March 2009, $:1,860,000 from january 2008 to March 2009, $4,860,000 was transferred to jTA Supermarkets. US prosecutors say that money was then paid back to jack Walker in local currency. Now Walker in local currency. Now consider the cash withdrawals. Our papers show nearly $$60,000 or nearly $360,000 of the Fifa money was distributed to jack Warner’s personal drivers and assistants. And then there’s this. $1.6 million in personal loans for Mr Warner and payments to his own credit cards. $10 million. Sent by Fifa at the request of South Africa. Money spent byjack Warner with no obvious checks or balances. We presented our investigation to Brent Sancho, Trinidad and Tobago’s sports minister and former footballer. I’m devastated because a lot of that money should be back in football. And what should happen to jack Warner now? With this evidence, he’s dodged a bullet too many times and it’s time for him to answer for his actions. South Africa did give me... jack Warner refused to comment on our report. He has said he’s innocent and will soon reveal the truth of what happened inside Fifa. Back at Fifa, the head of its audit and compliance committee is reported to have said that Qatar - and Russia - could lose their rights to host the World Cup if evidence of bribery emerges. Our Sports Correspondent Richard Conway is with me. Where does that take things, Richard? Well, as we’ve seen from that report, the confidence and the integrity many feel should have been present in those previous World Cup decisions is slowly being eroded. We saw today in some newspapers how Morocco might have been the legitimate winners of the 2010 World Cup. That is something the investigators will have to look into, and Fifa as well. The more worrying thing for Fifa tonight will be World Cup 2018 and World Cup 2022 going to Russia and Qatar respectively and Domenico Scala, the head of Fifa’s compliance committee, saying they might not get them. Both countries have strenuously denied wrongdoing, and Fifa’s inquiry turned a big clean bill of health for them but that inquiry didn’t have the power to look into bank accounts or subpoena witnesses. The FBI does. Worrying times for Fifa, and for those countries. Thank you. A Royal Navy warship, HMS Bulwark has rescued at least 500 migrants off the coast of Libya. The ship was sent to the Mediterranean by the government, to help the rescue effort for migrants whose boats run into difficulty trying to reach southern Europe. More than 43,000 people have already crossed the Mediterranean this year, a 50% increase on last year’s numbers. And it’s estimated that more than 1,600 people have drowned trying to make the crossing so far this year. Our defence correspondent is on board and sent this report. At first light, HMS Bulwark launched one of her helicopters to search for the boats filled with migrants. It didn’t take to find them. Up on the bridge, the ship prepared to launch her own boats to begin the rescue. HMS Bulwark has only been patrolling these waters for a month and has already saved over 1700 people. This would be her busiest day yet. At the moment we are probably looking at upwards of 600 or 700 and those are just the ones we know about, bearing in mind it’s only just gone eight o’clock and we’ve been them for four or five hours already. And this is what they are being rescued from, this one boat was crammed with nearly 1100 people. Some stored like cargo beneath the deck by the gangs of traffickers who left them to drift without an engine. In a vessel never designed to cross the Mediterranean. Some with no life jackets either, and barely enough room. No surprise that they scrambled to safety. From chaos to hope of a better life. Now about to board a Royal Navy warship, some still sick from their perilous journey. This woman had to be carried off after fainting from dehydration. There are now hundreds of migrants who have been rescued coming on board HMS Bulwark. Their only belongings the clothes they are wearing. And it seems to be part of an unstoppable tide of people leaving Africa, trying to reach Europe. Among the rescued were Syrians who had fled one war and Africans who had gone to Libya for work and then had to flee another conflict. They had each paid $1000 to human traffickers trading on their misery. Among them Tor, a 26-year-old Christian originally from South Sudan who had to leave his young family behind. I don’t know if they are alive or if they’ve died. Tor says he wants to start a new life in the UK. But he’sjust one of more than a thousand people that have been picked up today byjust one British warship. And no one knows when this human tide making its way from Africa to Europe will end. Results from Turkey’s parliamentary elections show President Erdogan’s party has lost its Parliamentary majority. He was hoping to gain enough support necessary to change the constitution and extend his powers. But his party is now expected to have to form a coalition, and the main Kurdish party has won enough votes to allow it to enter parliament for the first time. Let’s join our correspondent Mark Lowen in Istanbul- how much will this result change Turkey? How significant will the result be for Turkey and for the region? Hugely significant. This is potentially the start of a new political era here. It might look like a celebration at the governing they keep a -- like a celebration at the governing they keep a -- AKP party headquarters, but the party that seemed unstoppable figures has lost its majority and suddenly seems very vulnerable. The error of the President’s dominance of Turkish politics seems to be at an end. He divides opinion, loved and loathed in equal measure, adored by supporters for transforming the colony and giving voice to religious Turks, hated by his critics for muzzling free speech and eroding democracy. This election matters because Turkey matters. It’s a vital Western ally in a volatile Middle East, a Nato member that borders Syria and Iraq, often held up as a country that combines Islam and democracy. Its political leadership and path and uncertain, which will have ramifications far beyond its borders. Thank you. President Obama has said he hopes that Britain will stay in the European Union and that the government should spend at least 2% of economic output on defence. He’s been speaking at the G7 talks in Germany. The Prime Minister has announced the deployment of 125 extra troops to Iraq. This special report. It doesn’t get more Bavarian than this. An entire Alpine village turns out for President Obama. He wanted to shake every hand. Chancellor Angela Merkel despaired of keeping control of the most powerful gust but the Bolelli had a greater significance. Washington sees Germany as the stable giant of the European Union and President Obama was about to intervene deliberately in Britain’s EU referendum debate. Meeting David Cameron one-on-one, the president urged Britain not to exit the EU. I would note that one of the great values of the United Kingdom in the European Union is its leadership strength. So we very much looking forward to the United kingdom staying a part of the European Union, because we think its influence is positive, notjust for Europe. David Cameron simply did not respond, speaking only about other issues. If your Mac as you said, there are so many issues to discuss at this meeting and bilaterally, we are a close partnership, a partnership between the UK and the US is especially relationship, it all comes down to two Woods, posterity and security. -- prosperity. To add to his woes the president apparently Preston to keep spending on defence as 2% of gross domestic product is the price for being in Nato. Before that was awkward for the Prime Minister he is using the summit to come to Washington’s fears of shrinking Britain. He told his allies that Britain will send up to 125 extra troops to Iraq to counter so-called Islamic State, not to fight but to train Iraq is trapped rat’s an army. There’s a sense of global threat on many fronts at this summit. For even getting close to the leaders means getting a lift from the German military to a mountain castles sealed off with massive force. The other great thread these leaders fear is from that Amir Putin, the Russian president they kicked out of the club. The Russian is warning that unless Russia honours the Minsk agreement in full there will be no letup in sanctions. David Cameron is to tell Cabinet members they’ll have to support his position in Europe to stay in the government. More than 50 Conservative MPs have formed a group aimed at pushing David Cameron to go further in securing fundamental Live now to Westminster and our Political Correspondent, Carole Walker. How much How ITIUCi’I pI’âSSUI’â MPs be able to put on the Prime Minister? The battle lines within the Conservative Party on becoming clearer. David Cameron telling his Cabinet ministers that if they want to be part of the government they will have to support his policy. No question of a free vote. This policy is to negotiate a better deal and then to campaign for a Yes vote in that referendum, although he’s always said that if he doesn’t get what he wants in Europe you rules nothing out. Furthermore, it is prepared to throw the full weight of the civil service behind that campaign. And that has angered Conservative Eurosceptics, who say it is unprecedented and unfair for civil servants to take sides in a referendum. Therefore ready set out their demands, wanting for example the British Parliament to be able to deliver a red card to veto any EU policies Andrew Wilson they don’t want. That has been ruled out of hand by the Foreign Secretary, who says it is not achievable, not on the cards. Itjust shows how, get it it will be David Cameron to deal with the competing demands of his EU partners and his MPs. But Mac thank you. Mo Farah has pulled out of an athletics meeting in Birmingham, saying he is ""emotionally and physically drained"" following doping allegations surrounding his coach. Yesterday Farah said he was angry his name has been ""dragged through the mud."" There’s no suggestion he has done anything wrong - and the coach, Alberto Salazar, has strongly denied all of the claims. David Ornstein reports. The Alexander Stadium in Birmingham. Theirs is where Mo Farah, the poster boy of British athletics, was supposed to compete today. Mo Farah breaks the world-record! The start of the show back in the city where he broke records in February. It was he who the crowds came to see. Instead they arrived to news of his withdrawal as the fallout of allegations of doping aimed at his coach but as others and his training partner Galen Rupp continued. Salazar and Galen Rupp denied the allegations and business are just that Farah has done anything wrong. In a statement, the double Olympic champion said this. Farah’s decision followed an angry, emotional news conference yesterday. My name is getting dragged through the mud and it is not fair. I’m angry. I need answers. If they turn out to be true... But if he’s crossed the line I be the first to leave him. ‘S absence didn’t go down well with spectators. It would have been very nice to see him, it’s what people have come to see. It’s a shame, we wanted to see mode today. I do feel shame, we wanted to see mode today. Ido feel sorry for him and I hope it clears up. I’m surprised, I thought if he was going to pull out he’d have done it earlier. And disappointment even from those who know him best. From his office point of view not a great decision, we and the fans wanted to see him run. It’s his decision and he must do what he feels is right at a difficult time for him. Steve Cram does not doubt Mo Farah’s innocence. Mother and was meant to run in the 1500 metres but it plays about him because he was on a flight to the USA. He wants answers from our Berthold Salazar as he, British athletics and the sport as a whole face the most unwelcome of crises -- as a whole face the most unwelcome of crises -- he wants answers from Alberto Salazar. With all the sport, here’s Ollie Foster at the BBC Sport Centre. Sir Bradley Wiggins has broken cycling’s hour record bettering the old mark by almost a mile. He described the 60 minutes as ‘tortuous’ as he covered almost 34 miles inside London’s Olympic Velodrome. Our reporter Matt Slater saw him do it. When you’ve only got one hour to go as fast as you can there’s no point hanging about. And British cycling’s best known man in a very continued like this for the next 60 minutes, ahead of schedule, and the 6000 strong crowd at the Olympic velodrome knew from the start that the record Alex Dowsett said last month was on borrowed time. The end, when it came, was like everything, swift, and it seemed the cameraman was more wary than Bradley Wiggins he performed the celebratory by gift. Then time to kiss the family, Merck for the snappers and to reflect on the fact that he had travelled the best part of 34 miles. Not many Tour de France winners have done this, even the great Lance Armstrong. I think five of us have won the Tour de France and done this record. After hours of staring at this line he’s added his name to a select group of riders. Has he done this too far, scaring away a generation of riders just when the record was getting fun again? He’s certainly set the bar very high. 20 years after their last match against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin was abandoned because of rioting supporters, England’s first return passed without incident, on the pitch as well unfortunately as it finished goalless at the Aviva Stadium. England manager Roy Hodgson praised the conduct of the fans but former international Paul Scholes said the friendly was ""a waste of an afternoon"". There was a major upset at the French Open. Stanislas Wawrinka is the new champion after beating the World No1 Novak Djokovic in four sets. It’s the Swiss player’s second Grand Slam title. Adam Wild reports. For Novak Djokovic, it was to be the crowning glory, the French open title completing a career grand slam. At least, that was the plan. Only Stanislas Wawrinka was left to beat him and perhaps that should have been a warning. After a routine that set, the world number one, and little sign of what was to come. Almost all the talk was of Djokovic. Wawrinka was coming alive, the ferocity showed, and once channelled properly, was gripping. Wawrinka only got stronger, a break looked ahead, and the third was this. Pressure that only a grand slam final can bring requires a steely nerve and unerring accuracy that this was never found, a stunning backhand winner taking him to the brink. There was no reply. Stanislas Wawrinka, the champion, and the Djokovic, his bit of history will have to wait another year. Lewis Hamilton led from start to finish at the Canadian Grand Prix to move 17 points clear in the Formula One Driver’s Championship. He took the chequered flag from his Mercedes teamate Nico Rosberg. Vallteri Bottas was third for Williams. It’s Hamilton’s fourth win of the season. As you’ve heard, Mo Farah didn’t race in Birmingham today, but there were some impressive performances in the Diamond League meeting from other British athletes, It was a bitter sweet afternoon for Adam Gemili. He broke 10 seconds in the 100 metres for the first time, finishing second in 9.97, but as he dipped for the line he suffered a suspected hamstring tear. 19-year-old Dina Asher-Smith set a personal best in the 200 metres, posting the second quickest time by a British woman over the distance. And the Olympic champion Greg Rutherford is in good form. He won the long jump with a leap of 8 metres 35. That’s all the sport tonight. Thanks Ollie. just before we go let’s take a quick look at some of the main stories coming up this week. Tomorrow, Alton Towers reopens to the public. It was closed last week when four people were seriously injured on a roller coaster. Also tomorrow, the G7 leaders will finish their talks in Germany, with Russia high on their agenda. And on Friday night, the Queen’s birthday honours list is announced by Buckingham Palace. That’s all from me, stay with us on BBC1, it’s time Good evening. The family of Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police sparked riots four years ago, have called upon the Home Secretary to launch a ‘judge-led’ public inquiry into his death. Last year, Mr Duggan’s relatives lost their attempt to overturn an inquest verdict - which found his shooting by police was ‘lawful’. Marc Ashdown reports. Since the day Mark Duggan was shot dead, the community of Tottenham have demanded answers. This afternoon, the first time his family have called them together. They still believe he was killed unlawfully. Mark was actually the victim of an operation that went tragically wrong. There’s already been an inquest and an Independent Police Complaints Commission review. Now the supporters want the government to intervene and agree to a full judge-led public inquiry. Even thejudge who judge-led public inquiry. Even the judge who presided over the inquest is still concerned about ",,
194,BBC1 London,18-jun-2015,BBC News at Ten,22:00,25 mins,True,"Tonight at Ten: President Obama urges Americans to rethink their attitudes to gun crime and racial hatred. He spoke after this 21-year-old was accused of shooting dead nine black people at a church in South Carolina. The church has a rich African-American heritage. The President said the attack should make people question their attitudes. At some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries.

Beware the online ratings: a BBC investigation reveals a worldwide trade in fake customer reviews. And a look at the controversial new documentary about the life of the late Amy Winehouse. Tonight on BBC London. London Ambulance apologises for leaving a pregnant woman for an hour, after she was attacked and lost her baby. And we could be heading towards the biggest Tube strike in over a decade injust a few weeks’ time. Good evening. President Obama has urged Americans to rethink their attitudes to gun violence and racial hatred after nine people were were shot dead inside a church in South Carolina. He said mass killings did not happen with such frequency in other advanced countries. The attack happened at an African-American church in Charleston. A 21-year-old white man has been arrested. Police said they were treating the shooting as a hate crime. Our North America editorjon Sopel has the latest. This is the face of the man arrested in connection with the cold blooded murder of nine people in Charleston last night. Dylann Roof was taken from the local police station, near where he had been arrested, handcuffed and wearing a vest for his own protection. From all faiths and from all walks of life, the people of Charleston came together, to pray for those who perished in the gun attack on one of the city’s most historic black churches. It was 9.00pm, and a peaceful prayer meeting at the E-Manuel Afro-American church, and it became a scene of terrible carnage. -- African-American church. A lone white man had sat in the Bible study class until it was ending. Then he opened fire in what the police were quick to describe as a hate crime. Outside on the streets people gathered in stunned disbelief. Be with us God. As we will be here until the morning. Until we get some answers! A relative of one of the family members who died, was told by a survivor, what had unfolded. Hejust said he had to do it. He said that we rain their women and we have taken over his country and we have to go. This is as close as we can get to where the shootings took place last night. The church is about 200 yards down the road behind me. It has shocked this town, it has shocked America. In a country that is well-used to gun crime. This morning Roof was identified from this CCTV footage. He had been given a handgun has a 21st birthday present by his father. On his Facebook page a coat he is wearing with two flags on it. One the road easian flag, the other an apart white flag. One of those who died was the Pastor, Clementor Pinkney, a friend. There is something particular about a death happening in a place in which we seek solace and peace. There was a note of exasperation in his voice, as once again he had to address the issue of gun crime. At some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. In Washington, the most powerful law makers in the world came together to hold a prayer vigil but apparently unable to overcome this society’s deep-seated racism and unwilling to do anything about the gun laws. President Obama said the shooting in an African-American church also raised questions about a ‘dark part’ of US history. The attack is being treated as a hate crime though police have given no more details about a possible motive. Our correspondent Nick Bryant reports on reaction to this latest atrocity in the US involving guns. At the stroke of mid-day, church goers across America joined hands and sang songs in a moment of shared pain. Comfort me right now, Holy Spirit, the church and the community. Lord we ask you to give glory out of this... The struggle for black equality was notjust this... The struggle for black equality was not just a social revolution but for many a religious crusade. The church was central. Providing leadership, moral power, a sense of hope. The attack in Charleston opened up historic wounds. Racism is rare. Not like it was in the 50s, so we are weeping those thing all over again. The country has to look at whether or not we are to continue fighting the Civil War, or we are going to go together and really be the United States of America. This is reviving memories of one of the most grotesque crimes of the 6 #os, when white supremacy bombed a black church in Alabama. Schoolgirls pulled dead from the rubble. There was a sense of dismantling in the south. 50 years ago, the pews here were full of protestors, America has come a long way. But for all of the reforms of the civil rights era, it has always been impossible to legislate against hate. When Barack Obama entered office, there was. I mystic talk of America becoming a post racial society. But today he sounded des pondent. This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked, we know that hatred across races and faiths poses a threat to our domestic and to our ideals. This afternoon, this church in Harlem hosted a school graduation ceremony but these children know that they are growing up in a country where race is the unresolved dilemma. Our North America Editorjon Sopel joins us from Charleston. Ivn. jon, the President’s appeal for a change of an dued, notjust on gun crime but racial hatred, is it likely to lead to anything? It is such a central question facing the policy makers. We have been able to get close to the church where the murders took place last night. Most stories you cover in America are either about race or guns. Last night, the two strands came together. On race it’s been a terrible year, race riots in Baltimore and in Ferguson, Missouri. Black people, protesting about the way that they are treated by the police. On gun control, you heard the tone of ex-aspiration in Barack Obama’s voice, describing and saying at some point society has to confront the issue. The phrase that people are willing and able, that phrase, well, on the issue of gun crime, it seems that Congress is unwilling and on the issue of race, it seems that Congress is unable. jon thank you very much. An emergency summit of European leaders has been called for next Monday, in the latest attempt to resolve the Greek debt crisis. Today’s ministerial talks in Luxembourg ended without agreement, intensifying fears that Greece is heading for bankruptcy and an exit from the euro. The International Monetary Fund has ruled out any extra time for Greece to pay its debts and it’s warned Athens there will be no further ""grace period"". Our economic editor Robert Peston reports. Greece, and its premiere elected, Alexis Tsipras, whose head would say most, is Angela Merkel of Germany. But how much longer in the clan, after today’s supposedly last-ditch meeting of the finances ministers and the International Monetary Fund to prevent Greece defaulting on debts and possibly tumbling out of the euro. What happened? Regrettable to say that too little progress has been made in the talks between the institutions and Greece, and that no agreement as yet is in sight. Greece’s Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, chatting with Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, insisted he had a comprehensive solution to the meeting. She did not spot it. We can only arrive if there is a dialogue. At the moment we are short of dialogue. So the key merge, in my view, is to restore a dialogue with adults in the room. Greece has a staggering 320 billion euros of government debt. Equivalent to about 180% of the national income or GDP. So its debt burden is twice that of Britain. It is an immediate problem, the huge repayments it has to make in coming weeks, including more than 1. to make in coming weeks, including more than1. 5 more than 1. 5 billion euros to the IMF at the end ofjune and about 3. 5 billion euros to the European Central Bank and other Central Banks onjuly 20th, leaving Central Bank and other Central Banks on july 20th, leaving a further 14 billion euros to pay before the end of the year. Greeks have been withdrawing billions of euros from the banks. If Greece fails to pay the IMF, then there is a risk that the European Central Bank will turn off the life support provided to Greek banks. The fact that people are taking money from the bank, they are worried about the future, what it may bring. This leads us to the point it would be in the interests of Greece and the Greek people to reach an agreement and responsibility for that lies with the Greek government. Any kind of mending of the Greek economy, would evaporate, if the Greek banking system were to completely seize up. We are dangerously close to a state of mind that accepts an accident. And I urge my colleagues not to fall P""âY And I urge my colleagues not to fall prey to this state of mind. We can forge a good agreement. Greece belongs to Europe, well thousands of Greeks gathered outside of the Parliament in Athens to urge the government not to quit the euro. Greece’s Prime Minister is to meet his eurozone counterparts on Monday to see if a rescue is possible. Tonight that looks like a hope, not an expectation. In a moment, we’ll be speaking to our Europe editor Katya Adler in Brussels, but first to our world affairs correspondent james Reynolds in Athens. ~ I suppose the question is, is there a clear view among the Greek people about whether they want to stay in the Euro? A lot of them do but they don’t want austerities. Many still support the government of Alexis Tsipras. That enables him to is did to his positions. Remember, a lot of Greeks still blame his opponents, the old political parties for provoking the crisis in the first place. There is something else to look at as well with public opinion, follow the money. In recent days, Greeks have withdrawn more and more savings from the country’s banks. One economist described it to me as a bank walk, not a run but some Greeks will be cheering on the government at the same time as they prefer to trust their money to the underside of a mattress. james, many thanks. Straight to Brussels now. How would you describe the level of determination of European leaders, looking ahead to this emergency summit, to keep the Greeks inside the Eurozone? This is what Alexis Tsipras’ the Eurozone? This is what Alexis Tsipras’ government always wanted, discussion of the Greek rises at leadership level. Forget the technocrats and the finance ministers, the fact 19 euros only does are coming to Brussels on Monday means it is not over yet. When the most powerful leader in Europe, Angela Merkel stands up in front of the doomsayers, including those in her own government, and says the deal is still possible, it means something. It does not mean there will definitely be a deal on Monday or Greece will definitely stay in the Eurozone, but Germany has spent the last six D is investing in the European project and Angela Merkel does not want to be the leader watching over bits of it falling apart. She will remind Eurozone leaders she has her sites on the big picture, the credibility of the Eurozone in the financial market and its unity in the face of an aggressive Russia. Alexis Tsipras will have to come up with something new and credible on Monday if he wants to stay in the Eurozone. Angela Merkel is a pragmatist and a political survivor and went back a sinking ship. Thank you forjoining us. Katya Adler in Brussels and james in Athens. The crumbling fabric of the Palace of Westminster needs urgent attention. An independent report says that repairs and upgrades could cost £6 billion, and could take decades if MPs and peers insist on staying in the building while the work is done. The major structural challenges include removing asbestos as our political correspondent Vicki Young reports. It may be a palace but it is one in desperate need of repair. Crumbling walls and ceilings, peeling wallpaper, fears over asbestos and deep in the basement, miles of cables that need untangling and replacing. The dilapidation is starting to affect the thousands of people who work here. Twice I have had urine pouring through from the upstairs gents, through my office ceiling into the office, over my tables, chairs, computers and everything. It has all had to be taken out and dried off. For decades, they’ve been patching up as they go along but today’s report warns of irreversible damage unless action is taken soon. We don’t have the structure to contain a fire, if it were ever to break out, to prevent it spreading to the whole building. So for a building of this quality, that is worrying and it could be catastrophic. Over the years, more and more things have started going wrong with this ancient building. It is a World Heritage Site, so a huge programme of work is now required. On the practical side, the politicians have to decide whether to stay here while the work is going on around them, or move out, find somewhere else to go. If MPs and peers refuse to leave while the work is done, it is expected to cost £6 billion and take a staggering 32 years. If the Commons and the Lords move out in turn, it will be around £4 billion and last 11 years. The cheapest option would be about £3.5 billion and mean that the MPs and the peers leave completely. But MPs are divided over where that temporary accommodation would be. As a northern MP, I would be happy for Parliament to move to Lancaster, the centre point for the United Kingdom. Let me kill dead the stupid, asinine idea that you can move Parliament out of London. It is now up to the politicians to decide which option to take. But they will all come with a big bill for the taxpayer and years of disruption to Parliament. Vicki Young, BBC News. A BBC investigation has uncovered a global trade in false customer reviews online, paid for by companies to improve their image. Research in the UK suggests as many as 20% of online reviews of products and services could be fake. Tomorrow, the Competition and Markets Authority is publishing its first ever report into the problem. Our correspondent Angus Crawford has this special report. In Theatreland, good reviews fill seats. A top billboard rating means big money. But reviews are moving online, to sites like Trip Advisor. There are review sites now for almost everything from hotels to hospitals, cars to computers. But how far should you really trust them? Take this site, payday loan broker, Busy Loans. Almost everyone gives it five stars. Can we believe any of this? No, absolutely not. This investigator says that most of the Busy Loans reviews are fake. Though he’s no idea who posted them. They are on the website of a company called Trust Pilot, which displays customer comments for a whole range of businesses. Someone is basically generally stealing identities and putting fake reviews on there to build up the reputation of the company. Ashley apparently recommended Busy Loans to everyone, only we know she didn’t. She was killed in a car crash seven years ago. The photo came from her memorial site. I think it is despicable for them to do it in this fashion. They are simply attempting to dupe the public, cheat and lie. I am delighted it was brought to my attention so we can expose them. Monaco, home to the British man behind Busy Loans, Neil Griffiths. We don’t know if he was involved with the fake reviews but wanted to find out what he thought. Hello, Mr Griffiths, sorry to bother you today. It is Angus Crawford from the BBC. So Mr Griffiths hasjust hung up. He says he really doesn’t want to talk to me at all. So still no answers for Ashley’s family. So how easy is it to post...? Dig a bit deeper and you find a whole industry dedicated to duping the public. We found what seemed to be British companies, openly offering to pay for fake reviews and scores of writers advertising their services, willing to post bogus reviews with no fear of being found out. We tracked one of them down to this place, Dhaka in Bangladesh. I got paid $5 for a review. This man is a student, trying to make ends meet, like many others. How big a business is this, writing reviews for websites in Bangladesh? It’s a big field in Bangladesh. Many people are involved in it. Most of those Busy Loans reviews have been taken down by the host, Trust Pilot, Which say it is has a team of 30 rooting out fakes. Trust and transparency, it insists, are core values. A simple message, then, don’t believe every online customer comment and if a review looks too good to be true, it probably is. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Ukip’s deputy chairman, Suzanne Evans, appears to have been sacked as a party spokeswoman after saying that party leader Nigel Farage was perceived as ""very divisive"". Ms Evans, who wrote Ukip’s election manifesto, also told the BBC Mr Farage should not lead the campaign for the UK to leave the EU because of the way he was viewed. Pope Francis has blamed human greed and selfishness for damaging the planet and he’s called on everyone, especially those in richer countries, to take action to stop climate change. The comments were made in a papal encyclical, a letter from the Pope explaining his latest teaching. Some Conservative activists in the United States say it’s not the Pope’s business to stray into politics. Let’s join our religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt in Rome. Here at the Vatican, combining science and scripture, the Pope has written a letter to the world, making a powerful moral case for mankind to stop doing damage to what he calls a ruined planet. And in echoes of his namesake, Francis, equals on Catholics, those of all faiths and none to stop doing further harm to our common home. -- he calls on. The Earth’s climate is changing and as the world warms, the polar icecaps are melting. The sea levels are rising. Floods, drought and destruction that is mainly due to man, according to the Pope today. His letter to the faithful, released in Rome this morning, is more of a book, addressed to all mankind. The Pope warns man is turning the planet into an immense pile of filth. His language is almost apocalyptic. Pope Francis criticises those with the power to pollute and builds a moral case for change to an economic system that he says fits the rich at the expense of the poor. Today, the Pope calls on the rich to change their lifestyle, blaming human selfishness for the damage wrought on mother Earth. He says that it is not too late to stop the damage but warns that humankind must act now. The name of Pope Francis’ letter... At its launch in Britain in a school in east London, Cardinal Vincent Nichols explained the Pope’s message. There is no doubt that he says we won’t get our world right until we put the poorfirst. Not in the sense of they can do everything but we must have them first in our consciousness. So what is the ultimate purpose of business? It is to serve the world. It is to have that sense of repairing society. Travelling the world, Pope Francis has seen for himself the devastation wrought by extreme weather, often on the poorest, the people who braved the winds and the rain in Tacloban to catch a glimpse of him. Now the pontiff is using his diplomatic weight to try to set the global agenda, on the road to the UN climate summit later this year, addressing the changes that are already creating millions of climate refugees. People like this woman in Bangladesh, a refugee for ten years, along with her husband and five children. TRANSLATION: A cyclone and tidal waves washed everything away, our house, everything. During the day, the water level came up to my neck and at night, we had to sleep on sludge. We have lost everything. The poor, even on the doorstep of the Vatican, are the reason this Pope wants real change and an end to excessive consumption by some, that leaves many without. Caroline Wyatt, BBC News, Rome. A controversial documentary about the life of the late Amy Winehouse has its UK premiere tonight at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film has provoked anger among her family, who say it portrays them unfairly, and her father has told the BBC he is considering legal action. Our arts editor Will Gompertz explores the issues raised by the film. His report contains some flash photography. How big do you think you’re going to be? I don’t, at all, because, you know, my music is not on that scale. The music is not on that scale. Turned out it was. Herjazz-infused sound was a sensation. ..but I don’t think I’m going to be at all famous. She got that wrong, but this right. I don’t think I could handle it. I would probably go mad, do you know what I mean? I would go mad. We see a brilliant... And the Grammy goes to Amy Winehouse! ..charismatic and vulnerable musician, brought down by personal demons and a chaotic private life. The world wanted a piece of her. The documentary has had some excellent reviews, but not from Amy Winehouse’s father, Mitch. He isn’t happy with the way his part in her story has been depicted. ",,
195,BBC1 London,18-jun-2015,BBC London News,22:25,10 mins,True,"Good evening, I’m Asad Ahmad. The former boyfriend of a woman who was beaten so badly in Peckham - that she lost her unborn baby, has appeared in court charged with ‘child destruction’. Kevin Wilson, was remanded in custody - while Malorie Bantala remains in a critical condition in hospital. Today, London Ambulance Service issued an apology after the mother- who was 8 month’s pregnant- was left for more than an hour in need of urgent medical care after the attack. Victoria Hollins reports. Malorie Bantala was excited about becoming a mum in less than eight weeks’ time. But after an attack here in Talfourd Place in broad daylight on Monday night, her unborn baby died. Henrietta Smith, a neighbour was the first person on the scene. She was shouting and saying, ""I’m pregnant and he has hit me, he hit me in the stomach"". She was distraught. When I heard what had happened, it was even worse. At the time, I had no idea she was eight months pregnant. Malorie is still critically ill in hospital. The question today is why an ambulance did not arrive when one was called at 8:15pm. An hour and ten minutes later, there was still no sign of an ambulance or any paramedics. By 9:25pm, police made the call to cancel the ambulance and took her to hospital themselves. Maureen Perch has lived in the area for 50 years. Oh, terribly sad. You can’t get her out of your mind. Maybe they did not tell the services how, what an emergency it was. Maybe they thought it was just another case of a person being knocked over or something. The London Ambulance Service has confirmed the case was treated as lower priority. In a statement, it said: So how does the system work? Ambulance dispatchers use sophisticated software to categorise either Category A, immediately life-threatening, or Category C, not life-threatening. 75% of the most serious cases should be attended within eight minutes but that is being missed. Category C responses have generally been met in 20-30 minutes but it is often far longer now. A group representing patients says the formula or algorithm dispatchers use is not working. The algorithm may be appropriate to the resources that the LAS has but I don’t think it is appropriate to the needs of people in London. I think the system has changed. Life-threatening calls get a very rapid response and all other calls get a much slower response. That is something which we are very dissatisfied about. Malorie Bantala’s family too distressed to talk on today. Her former partner, 20-year-old Kevin Wilson, has appeared in court charged with GBH and child destruction. Victoria Hollins, BBC London News. A crippling strike on the underground - unlike any over the past decade - could happen within weeks. One union has already said it’s members will walk-out on the 8th ofjuly - with three others balloting their members - for industrial action - to take place on exactly the same day. Here’s our Transport Correspondent, Tom Edwards. The Tube is changing. Ticket offices are closing and from September, at the weekend, trains will run for 24 hours. The unions, though, are not happy and today, one of them said they would walk out on strike on the 8th ofjuly. The Aslef union represents most Tube drivers and is not happy with the 0.75% pay rise and for the introduction of 2lI-hour Tube and all-night working, a one-off payment of £500 for all staff with an extra £250 for drivers. London Underground seem intent on imposing changes that would simply mean people are forced to work lots more nights, a lot more weekends, with no real compensation. That just isn’t fair. London Underground says it is in the midst of negotiations over pay and the night Tube and it says pay levels are already fair. Any increase, though, must be sustainable. It is encouraging Aslef to attend further talks. Other unions will almost certainlyjoin this dispute. The last time there was joint action was in 2002. Then, there was no service at all on the tube. The RMT, the TSSA and Unite are balloting for strike action and could walk out on the same day. We find this call for strike action totally unnecessary. We need Aslef to come back to the table with us at ACAS and continue negotiations. There will now be more talks. There is not long, though, to avert what the unions are calling a summer of disruption. The Home Secretary has made a direct appeal to British people not to go and fight in Syria and Iraq.

You will be hurting the families who brought you up and the friends you love and care for and you will be travelling to a place where there are none of the freedoms and opportunities which you have enjoyed in this country. A white man wearing Muslim women’s clothes and a face veil- has been arrested after bomb-disposal experts made a controlled explosion of a suspicious package in Watford. Cars and buses were left abandoned while police cleared the area this afternoon. A robot was sent in to detonate the package. Investigations are continuing. Engineers are working to restore the water supply to homes in New Malden- after a water main burst during this evenings rushour. New Malden - after a water main burst during this evenings rushour. A watermain has burst causing travel disruption in this evenings rush hour in South West London. It happened near New Malden train station. Thames Water has apologised. Time for the weather. The weather is changing. You will notice two things tomorrow. You will notice it will feel cooler and you will notice that there will not be as much sunshine around. We are looking at cloud to move from the north. It will be to the north of London by the end of the night and in the countryside to the south. Feeling colder than last night. Early sunshine tomorrow. But the cloud is pushing from the north. Maybe one wore light showers but otherwise a fine and dry day. But more cloud than today. A little sunshine. 19 Celsius. Pretty good for the time of year. Not as warm as the 22 Celsius earlier on. Into the weekend, and summer solstice. Low pressure is dominating. The outlook, it looks like heavy showers on Saturday. Humid as well. Sunday should be dry, bright and less breezy. The national pictures now comes from the Louise. Thursday was a day of contrast, all due to a north-westerly wind. Driving in cloud over Scotland and Northern Ireland, and north-west England. In the south a beautiful blue sky and sunshine. Look at swannage on the Dorset coast, glorious. By contrast in the north, Glasgow, apologies but this was the story, cloudy and drab. Temperatures struggling at 11 Celsius. The cloud continues in Scotland with showers moving through north-west England a and as far south as Norfolk and Suffolk. The clearer skies in the south-west, where we could see the best of the weather. With you Friday, more cloud. By the middle of the afternoon, from 4.00pm, I suspect that the snapshot will look like this. Rather grey with a few showers in Scotland. Not so bad in the sheltered north-eastern areas. Highs of 14 Celsius. Similar in Northern Ireland. A few showers in the Isle of Man. Picking up showers along the North Sea coasts. Cloudy in London. But from the Isle of Wight to South Wales, into the south-west, we keep the sunshine and the warmth. The highs of 21 Celsius. For the weekend, low pressure in the driving seat. These systems will alter the equation as we move into the weekend. Outbreaks of showery rain on Saturday. A little disappointing. That rain is drifting to the south and to the east. Then we start to see warmth. That could trigger off sharp and thundery downpours. Highs of 22 Celsius. Sunday, the low pressure anchors into the north-west. So a further risk of showers here. Outdoor plans, barbecues, summer fetes should be better planned for England and Wales. The showers in the north-west, heavy and thundery. Temperatures a disappointing 13 to 20 Celsius. And Sunday is the summer solstice, the longest day. For some of you that means that summer is pretty much over from Monday onwards. You may not be wrong. Looking at Monday it is cool with showers or longer spells of rain. Looking pretty disappointing. The Met, Britain’s biggest police force. Sorry, did theyjust say 200 youths? It was a planned barbecue, like, it wasn’t meant to be like this. The victim is currently at hospital. The new series continues. The Met are the biggest gang. ",,
